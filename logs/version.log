1.5.5
- made further changes to classes in manual package to support execution from mac platform.

1.5.6

- added functionality to support small doc unit granularity.

This enhancement provides that the text bodies of the documents in the collection are mutually
exclusive.  Under the old approach, suppose we have a document, say, "Medicare Fraud" that includes
the text of the entire section on this topic.  A subsection of this (and thus, a section that constitutes
another document in the collection, might be called "Upcoding", (named after a form of medicare fraud), 
Because the section, Upcoding, is a subsection in the document hierarchy, its section is subsumed by 
the parent section, Medicare Fraud.  Under the old approach, then, Medicare fraud's text body included the
body of the Upcoding section as well.  Now, however, after the enhancement in 1.5.6, Medicare fraud section
includes in its body only that text which is NOT included in any child section's text body.
