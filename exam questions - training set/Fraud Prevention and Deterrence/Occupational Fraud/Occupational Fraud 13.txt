Explanation=Continuing the trend we have seen in our previous studies, small businesses‰??defined as those with less than 100 employees‰??suffered both a greater percentage of frauds (31%) and a slightly lower median loss ($155,000) than their larger counterparts. These findings accentuate the unique problems in combating fraud‰??primarily the limited amount of fiscal and human resources available for anti-fraud efforts‰??frequently faced by small organizations.See page(s) 4.632 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
