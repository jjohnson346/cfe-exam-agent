CorrectResponse=2

Explanation=When responding to the organization's residual fraud risks, management may transfer some or all of the risk by purchasing fidelity insurance or a bond. The cost to the organization is the premium paid for the insurance or bond. The covered risk of loss is then transferred to the insurance company, less any deductible payment included in the contract.See page(s) 4.822 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
