Section=Fraud Risk Assessment

Stem=In response to a risk identified during a fraud risk assessment, management may decide to eliminate an asset or exit an activity if the control measures required to protect the organization against the identified threat are too expensive. This response is known as:

Options=Avoiding the risk | Transferring the risk | Mitigating the risk | Assuming the risk

CorrectResponse=0

Explanation=When responding to the organization's residual fraud risks, management may decide to avoid a risk by eliminating an asset or exiting an activity if the control measures required to protect the organization against an identified threat are too expensive. This approach requires the fraud risk assessment team to complete a cost-benefit analysis of the value of the asset or activity to the organization compared to the cost of implementing measures to protect the asset or activity.See page(s) 4.822 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
