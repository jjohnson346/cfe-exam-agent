Explanation=Some rules for professionals insert the word ‰?? knowingly" in relation to illegal activities, saying: ‰??One should not knowingly be a party to an illegal activity.‰?? The Certified Fraud Examiner Code does not include this way out. Certified Fraud Examiners are generally not entitled to claim ignorance of the law.
