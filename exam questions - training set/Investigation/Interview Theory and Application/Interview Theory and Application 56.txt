Section=Interview Theory and Application

Stem=Blue, a Certified Fraud Examiner, has just begun an interview of White. After introducing himself and establishing rapport with White, what should Blue do next?

Options=Establish a transitional statement | Get a commitment for assistance | Start asking questions | None of the above

CorrectResponse=1

Explanation=Failure to get a commitment from the respondent to assist is one of the common mistakes made even by experienced interviewers. This is a critical step in setting the tone for the interview. A commitment of assistance requires positive action on the part of the person being interviewed. Remaining silent or simply nodding the head generally is not sufficient. The interviewer should ask for the commitment before the interview commences, and should encourage the respondent to voice that "yes‰?? aloud. If the interviewer encounters silence the first time, the question should be repeated in a slightly different way until the respondent verbalizes commitment.See page(s) 3.214-3.215 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
