Explanation="Proxemic communication" is the use of interpersonal space to convey meaning. The relationship between the interviewer and respondent is both a cause and effect of proxemic behavior. If the distance between the interviewer and the respondent is greater, there is more of a tendency for them to watch each other's eyes for clues to meaning. It is important to position the respondent's chair and the interviewer's chair at an acceptable distance. The correct conversational distance varies from one culture to another. In the Middle East, the distance is quite short; in Latin America, equals of the same sex carry on a conversation at a much closer distance than in North America. Often, as the subject matter of the interview changes, the interviewer can note the changes in the proxemic behavior of the respondent. If the person is free to back away, he might do so when the topic becomes unpleasant or sensitive.See page(s) 3.218 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
