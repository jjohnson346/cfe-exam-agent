Section=Interview Theory and Application

Stem=Baker, a Certified Fraud Examiner is getting prepared to conduct a lengthy and complex interview. To prepare himself, Baker should:

Options=Not take any notes with him to the interview | Jot key points to go over with the respondent | Take only documents he wishes to go over | Write down a detailed list of questions in advance

CorrectResponse=1

Explanation=Whenever possible, do not write down a list of interview questions. Let the interview flow freely. Inadvertently allowing the respondent to read a written list of questions can provide an opportunity to fabricate an answer. However, writing down key points the interviewer wants to discuss might be appropriate. Expound the notes from the results of questioning as soon as possible after concluding the interview‰??preferably immediately afterward. If this procedure is followed, the examiner will not have to take copious notes during the interview. Law enforcement officials are generally required to maintain notes. In the private sector the notes can usually be destroyed once a memorandum has been prepared summarizing the interview.See page(s) 3.213 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
