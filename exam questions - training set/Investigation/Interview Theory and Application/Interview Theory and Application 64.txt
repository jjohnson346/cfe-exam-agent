Section=Interview Theory and Application

Stem=in interviews, sometimes people are resistant to providing information. If the respondent says; "I'm too busy," how should the interviewer react?

Options=Tell the person the interview will not be difficult | Stress that the interview will be short | Stress that the interviewer is already there | Any of the above

CorrectResponse=3

Explanation=When the interviewer contacts the respondent without a previous appointment, there is a possibility that the respondent will be too busy at the moment to cooperate. "I'm too busy" is also used as an excuse for the real source of the person's resistance, which may be lethargy, ego threat, or dislike of talking to strangers. These situations can be diffused by the interviewer stressing that:‰?¢	The interview will be short.‰?¢	The interviewer is already there.‰?¢	The project is important.‰?¢	The interview will not be difficult.‰?¢	The interviewer needs help.See page(s) 3.229 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
