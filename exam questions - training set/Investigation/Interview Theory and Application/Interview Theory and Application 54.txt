Explanation=Kinetic communication involves the use of body movement to convey meaning Even though posture, hands, and feet all communicate, interviewers tend to focus attention on the face and are more accurate in their judgments of others if they can see facial movements and expressions. When the interviewer concentrates on facial expressions, the primary interest is eye contact. Eye contact primarily communicates the desire to make or avoid communication. A person who feels shame normally will drop the eyes to avoid the glance of another. This is not only to avoid seeing disapproval, but to conceal personal shame and confusion.See page(s) 3.219 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
