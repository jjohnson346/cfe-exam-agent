Stem=When attempting to remove a desktop computer for examination, if the computer is running, it is usually best to unplug it rather than allow it to go through its normal shutdown routine.

Options=True | False

CorrectResponse=0

Explanation=Generally, if a computer is on. an investigator will not want it to go through its normal shutdown routine because Windows is very good about cleaning up after itself. A number of temporary files will be deleted and possibly overwritten during a normal shutdown, and some of these files may be important to the investigation. In most cases, the investigator should simply unplug a running computer.See page(s) 3.717 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
