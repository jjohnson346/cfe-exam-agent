Section=Digital Forensics

Stem=Because the Windows operating system locks files and prevents erasure, examiners should always follow the normal Windows shut-down process before taking a computer for examination.

Options=True | False

CorrectResponse=1

Explanation=Generally, if a computer is on. an investigator will not want it to go through its normal shutdown routine because Windows is very good about cleaning up after itself. A number of temporary files will be deleted and possibly overwritten during a normal shutdown, and some of these files may be important to the investigation. In most cases, the investigator should simply unplug a running computer.See page(s) 3.717 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
