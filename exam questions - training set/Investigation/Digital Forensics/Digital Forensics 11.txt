Explanation=One rule of computer forensics is, don‰??t peek through the files. This also applies to disks. If a system is running, the examiner may be tempted to click on the My Computer icon to look for evidence and/or copy files to a flash or optical storage device. This should never be done, because each file the investigator touches will have its original time stamps changed; once this is done the original time stamps cannot be recovered. It will be obvious to the forensic examiner that this has occurred.See page(s) 3.718 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
