Section=Interviewing Suspects and Signed Statements

Stem=In admission-seeking interviews, there are several tactics the interviewer can use to interrupt denials. Which of the following tactics is NOT recommended to interrupt denials?

Options=Reasoning | Repeat interruptions | Delays | All of the above are tactics

CorrectResponse=1

Explanation=One of the most effective techniques to stop or interrupt a denial is through a delaying tactic. The interviewer should not argue with the accused, but rather attempt to delay the outright denial. Occasionally, it may be necessary to interrupt the accused's attempted denial repeatedly. Because this stage is crucial, the interviewer should be prepared to increase the tone of the interruptions to the point that he is prepared to say, "If you keep interrupting, I am going to have to terminate this conversation." The guilty individual will find this threatening, since he wants to know the extent of incriminating evidence in the interviewer's possession. If the above techniques are unsuccessful, the interviewer might attempt to reason with the accused and employ some of the tactics normally used for diffusing alibis. The accused is presented with evidence implicating him. The interviewer normally should not disclose all the facts of the case, but rather small portions here and there.See page(s) 3.254 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
