Explanation=In a criminal trial, both the prosecution and defense have statutory rights to certain pre-trial discovery. The defendant may inspect copies of ail relevant statements made by him in the custody of the government, a copy of his prior criminal record, and all documents, items, test results and other evidence the government intends to introduce at a trial or that are necessary to his defense. The defendant does not, however, have an absolute right to see copies of prior statements made by a witness against the accused until such witness testifies at trial. As a practical matter, however, the government v/ill frequently furnish such statements to the defendant.See page(s) 2.513 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
