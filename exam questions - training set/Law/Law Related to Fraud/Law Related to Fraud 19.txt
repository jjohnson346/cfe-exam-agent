Explanation=The mail fraud statute is the workhorse of federal criminal prosecutions. The gist of the offense is the use of the mails; without it, there is no federal jurisdiction. The mailing itself does not need to contain false or fraudulent representations, as long as it is an "integral" part of the scheme. What is integral depends on the facts and circumstances of each case It is not necessary for the fraudulent scheme to succeed or that the victim actually suffer a loss in order for the statute to apply.See page(s) 2.231 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
