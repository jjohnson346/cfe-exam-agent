Explanation=Under the fact situation presented. Black would generally not be held liable for breach of fiduciary duty if he hired White in good faith. Corporate officers are not sureties (guarantors) to the corporation for the fidelity of an inferior officer or agent appointed by them, so as to be liable for other embezzlements and defalcations, if they have acted prudently and in good faith and had no knowledge that the person was untrustworthy.See page(s) 2.213 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
