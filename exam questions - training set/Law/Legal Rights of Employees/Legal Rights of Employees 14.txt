CorrectResponse=0

Explanation=Evidence in "plain view" of an officer who has a right to be in position to observe it, may be seized by the officer without a warrant. This situation usually occurs when contraband or evidence of another crime is inadvertently discovered during a search or arrest for another offense. The discovery must be truly inadvertent, however: if discovery of the evidence is anticipated, and no other exception applies, a warrant must first be obtained.See page(s) 2.423 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
