Explanation=The Fourth Amendment covers illegal searches and seizures. Because the "bug" was placed in Brown's home, Green may have violated Brown's rights. The Fourth Amendment states: "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizure, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."See page(s) 2.417 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
