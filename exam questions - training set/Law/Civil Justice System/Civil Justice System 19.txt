Explanation=A "deposition" is sworn testimony given by a party or witness upon questioning by counsel for one of the parties before trial and outside of court, usually in a lawyer's office. Opposing counsel and a stenographer, who administers the oath and transcribes the testimony, also are present. Deposition testimony may be used to obtain evidence about the party's or the opponent's case, or to preserve testimony for trial, "lnterrogatories‰?Ê' may be served only on the opposing party, not on witnesses. "Requests to Produce Documents" may be served on opposing parties. Records from third-party witnesses or institutions may be obtained by subpoenas that often must be accompanied by deposition notices as well to take testimony to authenticate the documents.See page(s) 2.604-2.605 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
