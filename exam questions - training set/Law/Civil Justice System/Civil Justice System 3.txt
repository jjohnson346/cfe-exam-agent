Options=True | False

CorrectResponse=0

Explanation=A plaintiff who obtains a money judgment often must take additional steps to collect it. This may include garnishing wages of the defendant or levying against assets. In many instances, particularly in fraud litigation, a judgment may go uncollected because the defendant has already squandered the ill-gotten gains or has secreted them. In the latter circumstances, a plaintiff may conduct post-judgment discovery, including a deposition of the defendant, in an attempt to locate assets to satisfy the judgment.See page(s) 2.615 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
