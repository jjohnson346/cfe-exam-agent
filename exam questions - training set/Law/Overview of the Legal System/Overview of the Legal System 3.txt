Stem=Generally, who is permitted to appeal a criminal conviction?

Options=The prosecution or the defendant | Any party to the proceedings | The prosecution | The defendant

CorrectResponse=3

Explanation=Generally, because of the double jeopardy provisions of the Fifth Amendment, only a convicted defendant can appeal a verdict. The government cannot appeal an acquittal no matter how egregious the decision. The prosecution, however, may appeal adverse pre-trial rulings on the admissibility of evidence and certain other matters which may terminate in a prosecution temporarily, but do not result in a decision on the merits in favor of the defendant.See page(s) 2.109 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
