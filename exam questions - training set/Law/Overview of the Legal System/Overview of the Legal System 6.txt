Stem=Which of the following statements is the most correct?

Options=The government cannot appeal an acquittal on the merits of the case | A convicted defendant can appeal a verdict | The prosecution may appeal an adverse pretrial ruling | All of the above statements are true

CorrectResponse=3

Explanation=Because of the Fifth Amendment's double jeopardy provisions, only a convicted defendant in a criminal case can appeal a verdict. The government cannot appeal an acquittal on the merits of the case. The prosecution may, however, appeal adverse pre-trial rulings on the admissibility of evidence and certain other matters that may temporarily terminate a prosecution (but do not result in a decision on the merits in favor of the defendant). Either party in a civil case may appeal a judgment.See page(s) 2.109 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
