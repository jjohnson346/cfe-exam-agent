Explanation=Money laundering is the disguising of the existence, nature, source, ownership, location, and disposition of property derived from criminal activity. Businesses that are commonly used to front money laundering operations include bars, restaurants, and nightclubs. These businesses charge relatively high prices, and customers vary widely in their purchases. Sales are generally in cash, and it is notoriously difficult to match the cost of providing food, liquor, and entertainment with the revenues they produce.See page(s) 1.1601,1.1605 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
