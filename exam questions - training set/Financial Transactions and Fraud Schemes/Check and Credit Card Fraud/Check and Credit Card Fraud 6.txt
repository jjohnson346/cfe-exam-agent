Explanation=Traveler's checks have several distinguishing features. Watermarks and holograms are common, as well as microprinting and ultraviolet ink. There are basically two methods of counterfeiting traveler's checks: color copying and offset lithography/printing. Color-copied checks lack the raised ink texture which the intaglio printing press gives most traveler‰??s checks. Instead of having a textured feel, a phony check will appear slick and flat. Offset lithographic reproductions of actual checks are of higher quality than color-copied checks. However, neither will have the texture, watermarks, microprinting, or holograms which the genuine articles have.See page(s) 1.1005 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
