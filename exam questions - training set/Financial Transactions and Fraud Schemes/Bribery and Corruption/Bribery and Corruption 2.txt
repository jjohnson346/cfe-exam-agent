Explanation=A person taking payoffs or embezzling funds often fits into one of these categories: the "big spender" (one of the most common detection methods for this type of scheme); the "gift taker" (one who regularly accepts inappropriate gifts); the "odd couple" (payers and recipients who have an apparent, friendly social relationship but do not appear to have much in common); the "rule breaker" (one who either independently or through influencing another breaks, bends, or ignores standard operating procedures to benefit the payer); the "complainer" (one who makes excuses for deficiencies in the payer's services).
