Explanation=Generally, expense account review uses one of two methods: historical comparisons or comparisons with budgeted amounts. A historical comparison compares the balance expended this period in relation to the balance spent in prior, similar periods. When performing this review, consider changes to the marketing, servicing, or other company operations. Budgets are estimates of the money and/or time necessary to complete the task. They are based on past experience with consideration for current and future business conditions. Therefore, when comparing actual and budgeted expenses, determining inordinate expenses or inaccurate budget estimates is important.See page(s) 239 in the Corporate Fraud Handbook
