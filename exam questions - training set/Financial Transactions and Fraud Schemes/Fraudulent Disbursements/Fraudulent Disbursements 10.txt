For example, register counting and reconciling should not be done by the cashier.‰?¢	Cashiers, rather than supervisors, have access to the control keys which are necessary for refunds and voids.‰?¢	Register employee has authority to void own transactions.‰?¢	Register refunds are not methodically reviewed.‰?¢	Multiple cashiers operate from a single cash drawer without separate access codes.‰?¢	Personal checks from cashier found in register.‰?¢	Voided transactions are not properly documented or not approved by a supervisor.‰?¢	Voided cash receipt forms (manual systems) or supporting documents for voided transactions (cash register systems) are not retained on file.See page(s) 174 in the Corporate Fraud Handbook
