Stem=Which of the following is a type of computer virus?

Options=Executable files | Freeware | Worms | Crasher

CorrectResponse=2

Explanation=A worm is a self-replicating program which resides as a file on a system, executes an autonomous process, and deliberately moves from system to system. It looks for other nodes on the networks, copies itself to them, and causes the self-copy to execute on other nodes. These programs find network utilities showing node names, monitor network traffic, and randomly select network identification codes, as well as other mischief.
