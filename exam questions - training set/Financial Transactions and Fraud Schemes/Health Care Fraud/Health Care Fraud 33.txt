Section=Health Care Fraud

Stem=Hospitals never receive kickbacks from revenue recovery firms.

Options=True | False

CorrectResponse=1

Explanation=Often hospitals are unaware (sometimes intentionally) of the extent of the fraud committed by revenue recovery firms. In other cases, however, revenue firms report that they will contact a hospital or nursing home directly and tell the institution that if it will give them its bills, they will split the profit produced by the added charges.See page(s) 1.1232-1.1233 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
