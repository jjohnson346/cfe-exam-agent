Explanation=When a provider knows that a service is not covered, by using false diagnoses and covered procedure codes manipulation he will generally get the claim paid. In addition, before ordering expensive laboratory x-rays or other similar services, physicians justify the ordering of such procedures by documenting that a need exists to make such diagnostic inquiries. The services are rendered, but because false information on a claim is used to deceive the insurance company, the claim could be considered fraudulent.
