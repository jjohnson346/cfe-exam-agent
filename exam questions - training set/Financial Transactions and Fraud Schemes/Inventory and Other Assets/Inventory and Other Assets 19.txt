Explanation=There are basically two ways a person can misappropriate a company asset. The asset can be misused (or "borrowed‰??) or it can be stolen. Simple misuse is the less egregious of the two. Assets that are misused but not stolen typically include company vehicles, supplies, computers, and other office equipment.See page(s) 251 in the Corporate Fraud Handbook
