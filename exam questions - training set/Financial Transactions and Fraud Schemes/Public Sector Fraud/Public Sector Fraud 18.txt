Explanation=The first rule for interviewing government officials is to ensure that the interviewer is not subordinate to the subject of the interview. This is no problem for outside entities such as an independent counsel or even an inspector general, but where auditors or investigators need to interview someone far up in their own chain of command, problems may arise. If there is any possibility that the high official could presently or in the future influence the career of the interviewer, someone else should be chosen. Agencies should be able to call on outside entities to conduct such interviews where appropriate. In any event, any hint by the official of help (or harm) to the interviewer should be documented and reported.See page(s) 1.1925 in the Fraud Examiner‰??s Manual
