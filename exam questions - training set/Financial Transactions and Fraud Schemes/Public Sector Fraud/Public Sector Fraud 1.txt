CorrectResponse=3

Explanation=Chapter 5 of Government Auditing Standards (Reporting Standards for Financial Audits) states that when reporting instances of potential fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or abuse, auditors should place their findings in perspective by describing the extent of the work performed that resulted in the finding. When auditors detect immaterial violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements or abuse, they should communicate those findings in a management letter to officials of the audited entity unless the findings are clearly inconsequential to the financial statements considering both qualitative and quantitative factors. Auditors should refer to that management letter in their audit report on compliance (or to a management letter to be issued). Auditors use professional judgment when determining whether and how to communicate to officials of the audited entity potential fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or abuse that is clearly inconsequential. When auditors conclude that potential fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or abuse either have occurred or are likely to have occurred, they may consult with authorities and/or legal counsel about whether publicly reporting certain information about the potential fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or abuse would compromise investigative or legal proceedings. Auditors should limit their public reporting to matters that would not compromise those proceedings, such as information that is already a part of the public record.See page(s) 1.1905-1.1906 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
