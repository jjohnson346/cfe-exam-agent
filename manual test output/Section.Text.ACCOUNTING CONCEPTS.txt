ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS 
 
Fraudulent acts are usually of a financial nature. The fraud examiner must therefore 
understand the essential nature of financial transactions and how they affect records. 
Additionally, the fraud examiner should have a grasp of both financial terminology and 
accounting theory.  
 
 
Accounting Basics 
Accounting can be defined as the identification, accumulation, measurement, and 
communication of economic data about an enterprise for decision makers and other 
interested parties. The measurement and recording of this data are accomplished through 
keeping a balance of the accounting equation. The accounting model or accounting equation, 
as shown below, is the basis for all double-entry accounting:  
 
Assets = Liabilities + Owners� Equity 
 
By definition, assets consist of the net resources owned by an entity. Examples of assets 
include cash, receivables, inventory, property, and equipment, as well as intangible items of 
value such as patents, licenses, and trademarks. To qualify as an asset, an item must (1) be 
owned by the entity and (2) provide future benefit.  
 
Liabilities are the obligations of an entity or outsiders� claims against a company�s assets. 
Liabilities usually arise from the acquisition of assets or the incurrence of operational 
expenses.

Owners� equity  represents the investment of a company�s owners plus accumulated profits 
(revenues less expenses). Owners� equity is equal to assets minus liabilities.  
 
This equation has been the cornerstone of accounting since 1494, when Luca Pacioli 
invented it. The balance of the equation is the key. If a company borrows from a bank, cash 
(an asset) and notes payable (a liability) increase to show the receipt of cash and an 
obligation owed by the company. Since both assets and liabilities increase by the same 
amount, the equation stays in balance.  
 
Accounts and the Accounting Cycle 
The major components of the accounting equation are made up of numerous detail 
accounts. An account is nothing more than a specific accounting record that provides an 
efficient way to categorize similar transactions. All transactions are recorded in accounts that 
are categorized as asset accounts, liability accounts, owners� equity accounts, revenue 
accounts, and expense accounts. Account format occurs in a number of ways. The simplest, 
most fundamental format is the use of a large letter T, often referred to as a T account.  
 
Entries to the left side of an account are debits (dr) and entries to the right side of an account 
are credits (cr). Debits increase asset and expense accounts, while credits decrease them. 
Conversely, credits increase liability, owners� equity, and revenue accounts; debits decrease 
them. Every transaction recorded in the accounting records will have both a debit and a 
credit, thus the term double-entry accounting. The accounting equation, in the form of T 
accounts, looks like the following:   
 
 
 
Fraud investigation often requires an understanding of the debit-and-credit process. For 
example, a fraud examiner who is searching for a mysterious $5,000 disappearance of cash 
finds a debit in the legal expense account and a corresponding credit in the cash account for 
$5,000, but cannot find genuine documentation for the charge. The examiner can then 
reasonably suspect that a perpetrator may have attempted to conceal the theft by labeling the 
misappropriated $5,000 as a legal expense.  
 
 Assets  =  Liabilities + Owner's Equities

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.103 
Discovering concealment efforts through a review of accounting records is one of the easier 
methods of detecting internal fraud; usually, one needs only to look for weaknesses in the 
various steps of the accounting cycle. Legitimate transactions leave an audit trail. They start 
with a source document such as an invoice, a check, a receipt, or a receiving report. These 
source documents become the basis for journal entries, which are chronological listings of 
transactions with their debit and credit amounts. Entries are made in various accounting 
journals. Then, entries are posted to the appropriate general ledger accounts. The 
summarized account amounts become the basis for financial statements for a particular 
period. 
 
Illustrated below is this flow of transactional information through the accounting records, 
followed by examples of typical accounting transactions, to help in understanding how 
transactions affect the balance sheet: 
 
 
Journal Entries  
As transactions occur, they are recorded in a company�s books via journal entries. Each journal 
entry serves as a record of a particular transaction and forms an audit trail that can be 
retraced later for an understanding of a company�s operations. Journal entries that are not 
triggered by a transaction, called adjusting journal entries, are also made periodically for items 
such as depreciation expense and accounts receivable write-offs.

Accounting Methods 

There are two primary methods of accounting: cash-basis and accrual-basis. Cash-basis 
accounting involves recording revenues and expenses based on when a company pays or 
receives cash. For example, sales are recorded when a company receives payment for goods, 
regardless of when the goods are delivered. If a customer purchases goods on credit, the 
company does not book the sale until the cash is received for the sale. Likewise, if a 
customer prepays for a sale, the company records the sales revenue immediately, rather than 
when the goods are passed off to the customer. The same holds true with expenses: they are 
recorded when paid without consideration to when they are incurred.  
 
Accrual-basis accounting, on the other hand, requires revenues to be recorded when they are 
earned (generally, when goods are delivered or services are rendered to a customer), without

regard to when cash exchanges hands. Expenses are recorded in the same period as the 
revenues to which they relate. For example, employee wages are expensed in the period 
during which the employees provided services, which may not necessarily be the same 
period in which they were paid. 
 
Under cash accounting, a company may decide to postpone paying some expenses so they 
are not recorded in the current period, resulting in an artificially inflated bottom line. 
Conversely, accrual accounting requires expenses to be matched to revenues; therefore, it 
provides a truer picture of a company�s financial situation. As such, generally accepted 
accounting principles mandate the use of accrual-basis accounting.  
 
 
Financial Statements 
The results of the accounting process are reports, or financial statements, that exemplify the 
financial position and operating results of an entity. Financial statements are often the 
vehicles through which fraud occurs. 
 
According to AU section 623, Special Reports, promulgated by the AICPA�s Auditing 
Standards Board, financial statements include presentations of financial data and 
accompanying notes prepared in conformity with either generally accepted accounting 
principles or some other comprehensive basis of accounting. The following is a list of such 
financial statements: 
� Balance sheet 
� Statement of income or statement of operations 
� Statement of retained earnings 
� Statement of cash flows 
� Statement of changes in owners� equity 
� Statement of assets and liabilities that does not include owners� equity accounts 
� Statement of revenue and expenses 
� Summary of operations 
� Statement of operations by product lines 
� Statement of cash receipts and disbursements 
 
Although not specifically noted in AU section 623, financial statements may also include 
other financial data presentations, such as: 
� Prospective financial information (forecasts) 
Accounting Concepts  Financial Transactions   
1.106                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
� Proxy statements 
� Interim financial information (for example, quarterly financial statements) 
� Current value financial presentations 
� Personal financial statements (current or present value) 
� Bankruptcy financial statements 
� Registration statement disclosures (Securities Act of 1933) 
 
Other comprehensive bases of accounting, according to AU section 623, include: 
� Government or regulatory agency accounting 
� Tax-basis accounting 
� Cash receipts and disbursements, or modified cash receipts and disbursements 
� Any other basis with a definite set of criteria applied to all material items, such as the 
price-level basis of accounting 
 
Consequently, the term financial statements  includes almost any financial data presentation 
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or another 
comprehensive basis of accounting. Throughout this section, the term financial statements 
will include the above forms of reporting financial data, including the accompanying 
footnotes and management�s discussion. For most companies, however, a full set of financial 
statements comprises a balance sheet, a statement of income, a statement of owners� equity 
or a statement of retained earnings, and a statement of cash flows. Therefore, fraud 
examiners should be familiar with the purpose and components of each of these financial 
statements.  
 
Balance Sheet 
The balance sheet shows a �snapshot� of a company�s financial situation at a specific point in 
time, generally the last day of the accounting period. The balance sheet is an expansion of 
the accounting equation, assets = liabilities + owners� equity. That is, it lists a company�s assets 
on one side and its liabilities and owners� equity on the other side. The nature of the 
accounting equation means that the two sides of the statement should balance, hence the 
name �balance sheet.�  
 
The following balance sheet, derived from the journal entries in the above example, shows 
the financial position of XYZ Company on the last day of its first year of operations.

As mentioned, assets are the resources owned by a company. Generally, assets are presented 
on the balance sheet in order of liquidity, or how soon they are expected to be converted to 
cash. The first section on the assets side, current assets, includes all those assets that are 
expected to be converted to cash, sold, or used up within one year. This category usually 
includes cash, accounts receivable (the amount owed to a company by customers for sales 
on credit), inventory, and prepaid items. Following the current assets are the long-term assets, 
or those assets that will likely not be converted to cash in the near future, such as fixed assets 
(e.g., land, buildings, equipment) and intangible assets (e.g., patents, trademarks, goodwill). A 
company�s fixed assets are presented net of accumulated depreciation, an amount that 
represents the cumulative expense taken for wear-and-tear on a company�s property. 
Likewise, intangible assets are presented net of accumulated amortization, an amount that 
represents the collective expense taken for declines in value of the intangible property. 
 
Liabilities are presented in order of maturity. Like current assets, current liabilities  are those 
obligations that are expected to be paid within one year, such as accounts payable (the 
amount owed to vendors by a company for purchases on credit), accrued expenses (e.g., 
taxes payable or salaries payable), and the portion of long-term debts that will come due 
Accounting Concepts  Financial Transactions   
1.108                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
within the next year. Those liabilities that are not due for more than a year are listed under 
the heading long-term liabilities. The most common liabilities in this group are bonds, notes, 
and mortgages payable. The total balance of the note payable is listed under long-term 
liabilities on XYZ Company�s balance sheet, indicating that it does not have to make any 
payments on the note during the next year. However, if a $5,000 payment was required 
during the next year, the company would have to reclassify $5,000 of the note balance to the 
current liabilities section and show the remaining $70,000 as a long-term liability. This 
adjustment would not change the total amount of the outstanding liability that was shown � all 
$75,000 would still appear on the balance sheet - but it would allow financial statement 
users to know that the company had an obligation to pay $5,000 during the next year rather 
than at some unspecified time in the future.  
 
The owners� equity in a firm generally represents amounts from two sources � owner 
contributions (usually referred to as common or capital stock, and paid-in capital) and 
undistributed earnings (usually referred to as retained earnings). The balance in the capital stock 
account increases when the owners of a company invest in it through the purchase of 
company stock. The retained earnings balance increases when a company has earnings and 
decreases when a company has losses. The retained earnings account is also decreased when 
earnings are distributed to a company�s owners in the form of dividends, or when a company 
has losses. XYZ Company�s balance sheet shows that the company�s owners have 
contributed $192,000 to the company and that the company has retained $8,000 of earnings 
as of December 31, 20XX.  
 
Income Statement 
Whereas the balance sheet shows a company�s financial position at a specific point in time, 
the income statement details how much profit (or loss) a company earned during a period of 
time, such as a quarter or a year. The accounts reflected on the income statement are 
temporary; at the end of each fiscal year, they are reduced to a zero balance (closed), with the 
resulting net income (or loss) added to (or subtracted from) retained earnings on the balance 
sheet.  
 
Below is the income statement for XYZ Company for its first year of operations based on 
the sample transactions above.

Total Operating Expenses  7,000 
   
Net Income   $               8,000 
 
Two basic types of accounts are reported on the income statement - revenues  and expenses. 
Revenues represent amounts received from the sale of goods or services during the 
accounting period. Most companies present net sales  or net service revenues  as the first line item 
on the income statement. The term �net� means that the amount shown is the company�s 
total sales minus any sales refunds, returns, discounts, or allowances.  
 
From net sales, an expense titled cost of goods sold  or cost of sales  is deducted. Regardless of 
industry, this expense denotes the amount a company spent (in past, present, and/or future 
accounting periods) to produce the goods or services that were sold during the current 
period. For a company that manufactures goods, cost of goods sold signifies the amount the 
company spent on materials, labor, and overhead expenses to produce the goods that were 
sold during the accounting period. For a merchandise reseller, this expense is the amount the 
company has paid to purchase the goods that were resold during the period. For a service 
company, the cost of sales is typically the amount of salaries paid to the employees who 
performed the services that were sold. The difference between net sales and cost of goods 
sold is called gross profit  or gross margin, which represents the amount left over from sales to 
pay the company�s operating expenses.  
 
Operating expenses are those costs that a company incurs to support and sustain its business 
operations. Generally, these expenses include items such as advertising, management�s 
salaries, office supplies, repairs and maintenance, rent, utilities, depreciation, interest, and 
Accounting Concepts  Financial Transactions   
1.110                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
taxes. Accrual accounting requires that these items be included on the income statement in 
the period in which they are incurred, regardless of when they are paid.  
 
After subtracting operating expenses from gross profit, a company�s net income or net earnings 
for the period is determined. If a company�s total expenses were greater than its total 
revenues and the bottom line is negative, then it had a net loss  for the period. Commonly, a 
profitable company will distribute some of its net income to its owners in the form of 
dividends. Whatever income is not distributed is transferred to the retained earnings account 
on the balance sheet. In the case of XYZ Company, net income for the year was $8,000. The 
company did not distribute any of these earnings, so the total amount � $8,000 � is shown 
on the balance sheet as retained earnings. If the company is also profitable during its next 
year of operations, any net income that is not distributed as dividends will be added to the 
$8,000 balance in retained earnings. If expenses outpace revenues and XYZ Company shows 
a loss for its second year, that loss will be deducted from the $8,000 retained earnings 
balance at the end of the second year.  
 
To summarize, the income statement ties to the balance sheet through the retained earnings 
account as follows: 
 
 
 
Statement of Owners� Equity 
The statement of owners� equity details the changes in the total owners� equity amount listed 
on the balance sheet. Because it shows how the amounts on the income statement flow 
through to the balance sheet, it acts as the connecting link between the two statements. The 
balance of the owners� equity at the beginning of the year is the starting point for the 
statement. The transactions that affect owners� equity are listed next and added together. 
The result is added to (or subtracted from, if negative) the beginning-of-the-year balance, 
which provides the end-of-the-year balance for total owners� equity.

The statement of owners� equity for XYZ Company would appear as follows:

Owners� equity, January 1, 20XX  $              -

Net income for the year 8,000  
Increase in owners� equity 200,000  
Owners� equity, December 31, 20XX  $      200,000  
 
XYZ Company completed two types of transactions that affected the owners� equity during 
20XX: the $192,000 invested by the company�s shareholders, and the revenue and expenses 
that resulted in the net income of $8,000. Had the company distributed any money to the 
shareholders in the form of dividends, that amount would be listed on the statement of 
owners� equity as well. Notice that the $8,000 ties directly to the bottom line of the income 
statement, and the $200,000 owners� equity ties to the �total owners� equity� amount on the 
balance sheet.  
 
Some companies present a statement of retained earnings rather than a statement of owners� 
equity. Similar to the statement of owners� equity,  the statement of retained earnings starts 
with the retained earnings balance at the beginning of the year. All transactions affecting the 
retained earnings account are then listed and added to the beginning balance to arrive at the 
ending balance in the retained earnings account. Below is an example of the statement of 
retained earnings for XYZ Company:

Statement of Cash Flows 
The statement of cash flows reports a company�s sources and uses of cash during the 
accounting period. This statement is often used by potential investors and other interested 
parties in tandem with the income statement to determine the true financial performance of 
a company during the period being reported. The nature of accrual accounting allows (and 
often requires) the income statement to contain many non-cash items and subjective 
estimates that make it difficult to fully and clearly interpret a company�s operating results. 
However, it is much harder to distort the amount of cold, hard cash that was received and 
paid during the year, so the statement of cash flows adds to the transparency of the financial 
statements.  
 
The following is the statement of cash flows for XYZ Company:

The statement of cash flows is broken down into three sections: cash flows from operating 
activities, cash flows from investing activities, and cash flows from financing activities.  
Financial Transactions  Accounting Concepts 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.113 
Cash Flows from Operations 
The cash flows from operations section summarizes a company�s cash receipts and payments 
arising from its normal business operations. Cash inflows included in this category 
commonly consist of payments received from customers for sales, and cash outflows include 
payments to vendors for merchandise and operating expenses and to employees for wages.  
 
This category can also be summarized as those cash transactions that ultimately affect a 
company�s operating income; therefore, it is often considered the most important of the 
three categories of cash flows. If a company continually shows large profits per its income 
statement, but cannot generate positive cash flows from operations, then questionable 
accounting practices might be to blame. On the other hand, net income that is supported by 
positive and increasing net cash flows from operations is generally considered an indicator of 
a strong company. 
 
There are two methods of reporting cash flows from operations. In the above example, 
XYZ Company�s statement of cash flows is presented using the direct method. This method 
lists the sources of operating cash flows and the uses of operating cash flows, with the 
difference between them being the net cash flow from operating activities.  
 
In contrast, the indirect method  reconciles net income per the income statement with net cash 
flows from operating activities; that is, accrual-basis net income is adjusted for non-cash 
revenues and expenses to arrive at net cash flows from operations. Below is an example of 
XYZ Company�s cash flows from operations using the indirect method:

Accounting Concepts  Financial Transactions   
1.114                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Note that the net cash flows from operating activities is the same amount - in this case, 
$1,000 � regardless of the method that is used.  The indirect method is usually easier to 
compute and provides a comparison of a company�s operating results under the accrual and 
cash methods of accounting. As a result, most companies choose to use the indirect method, 
but either method is acceptable.  
 
Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
Cash inflows from investing activities usually arise from the sale of fixed assets (e.g., 
property and equipment), investments (e.g., the stocks and bonds of other companies), or 
intangible assets (e.g., patents and trademarks). Similarly, cash outflows from investing 
activities include any cash paid for the purchase of fixed assets, investments, or intangible 
assets.  
 
Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
Cash flows from financing activities involve the cash received or paid in connection with 
issuing debt and equity securities. Cash inflows in this category occur when a company sells 
its own stock, issues bonds, or takes out a loan. A company�s cash outflows from financing 
activities include paying cash dividends to shareholders, acquiring shares of its own stock 
(called treasury stock), and repaying debt.  
  
The total cash flows from all three categories are combined to arrive at the net increase or 
decrease in cash for the year. This total is then added to or subtracted from the cash balance 
at the beginning of the year to arrive at the cash balance at the end of the year, which ties 
back to the amount of cash reported on the balance sheet.  
 
Users of Financial Statements 
Financial statement fraud schemes are most often perpetrated by management against 
potential users of the statements. These users of financial statements include company 
ownership and management, lending organizations, investors, regulating bodies, vendors, 
and customers. The production of truthful financial statements plays an important role in 
the continued success of an organization. However, fraudulent statements can be used for a 
number of reasons. The most common use is to increase the apparent prosperity of an 
organization in the eyes of potential and current investors. (For more information, see the 
chapter on �Financial Statement Fraud.�)

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) 
In preparing financial statements, management, accountants, and auditors are charged with 
following measurement and reporting practices known as generally accepted accounting principles  
(GAAP). The accounting practices that compose GAAP have developed through the 
accumulation of authoritative accounting pronouncements issued by several authoritative 
bodies. Historically, these pronouncements included Accounting Research Bulletins, 
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinions, Financial Accounting Standards Board 
(FASB) Statements and Interpretations, Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts, and SEC 
Staff Accounting Bulletins.  
 
In 2009, FASB launched the FASB Accounting Standards Codification(FASB ASC)  as the 
sole source of authoritative U.S. GAAP for non-governmental organizations. The 
Codification compiles and organizes all previous sources of GAAP by topic, providing an 
efficient and easy-to-use structure for researching and referencing accounting standards. The 
FASB ASC effectively supersedes the pre-Codification GAAP hierarchy established in SAS 
No. 69 and FASB Statement No. 162.  
 
While the U.S. has its own set of accounting standards that form GAAP, the various 
accounting rules from different countries are converging. The International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB) is developing a single set of standards, called International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS). For each accounting function, the IASB is looking for the most 
appropriate principle for how transactions should be accounted for, or the most suitable 
method of reporting the results. The IASB has sought the best, sometimes adopting a 
standard from one country or another, other times creating a new standard entirely. 
Currently, more than 120 countries require or permit the use of IFRS, with several more 
planning to adopt IFRS in the next few years. A list of the countries that have adopted the 
IFRS is available at www.iasplus.com/country/useias.htm.  
 
Basic Underlying Accounting Principles 
Basic accounting principles, referred to as generally accepted accounting principles, are the 
rules by which a company�s financial transactions are recorded into their appropriate account 
classifications. These principles have evolved over time and are expected to continue 
changing in response to shifts in social and economic conditions, advancements in 
technology, and demand by users for more useful or productive standards. The following is 
a list of the basic underlying principles on which accountants should base their practices.  
 
Accounting Concepts  Financial Transactions

Historical Cost 
Although some exceptions exist, historical cost is, generally, the proper basis for the 
recording of assets, expenses, equities, etc. For example, a piece of operational machinery 
should be shown on the balance sheet at initial acquisition cost and not at current market 
value or an estimated replacement value. 
 
Revenue Recognition 
In general, revenue is recognized or recorded when it becomes realized or realizable, and 
earned. These criteria are usually met when:  
� Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,  
� Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,  
� The seller�s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and 
� Collectibility is reasonably assured.  
 
Therefore, revenue should not be recognized for work that is to be performed in subsequent 
accounting periods, even though the work may currently be under contract; the revenue 
should be recognized in the period in which the work is performed.  
 
Matching 
The matching principle requires that expenses be recorded in the same accounting period as 
the revenues they help generate. Estimates, accruals, and allocations are often needed to 
meet this requirement. When a sale is recorded, the appropriate charges for cost of goods 
sold, or other expenses directly corresponding to the sale, should be recorded in the same 
accounting period.  
 
Consistency 
Entities should employ consistent accounting procedures from period to period. Variations 
or changes in accounting policies and procedures must be justifiable. Standards used to value 
inventory, depreciate assets, or accrue expenses should be consistent from one accounting 
period to the next. 
 
Full Disclosure 
The financial statements of an entity should include all information necessary for the 
formation of valid decisions by the users. The statements should not include too much 
information, but are required to include enough information so that the user is not misled. 
Supplemental notes to the financial statements are usually required to meet these criteria. 
Financial Transactions  Accounting Concepts 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.117 
Objectivity 
Accounting records should be designed and kept on objective, rather than subjective, 
evidence. Underlying verifiability must exist for the information contained in the statements. 
For example, assets are carried at historical cost and not at an estimated current value. 
Historical cost should be verifiable through legitimate proof of purchase.  
 
Separate Entity Assumption 
Economic activity of an entity should be kept separate from other personal or business 
entities. For example, personal business transactions of an entity�s owners or operators 
should not be included in the financial reports of the entity.  
 
Going Concern � Continuity Assumption 
There is an assumption that an entity will continue as a going concern; that is, the life of the 
entity will be long enough to fulfill its financial and legal obligations. Any evidence to the 
contrary must be reported in the financial statements of the entity. 
 
Unit of Measure 
All financial reports are based on the monetary unit, e.g., the dollar for U.S. entities. This 
assumption recognizes that the monetary unit is an effective means of communicating 
financial information. Adjustments for inflationary trends are not shown in the financial 
statements of the entity. 
 
Periodicity�Time Period Assumption 
The life of an entity is divided into economic time periods on which reporting statements are 
fashioned. These reporting periods vary, but a year is the most common. Some companies 
follow the calendar year, while others use a business year that ends near the lowest point of 
business activity in a 12-month cycle, regardless of where that point falls in the calendar year.  
 
Departures from GAAP � Modifying Conventions 
As with rules for most things, departures from GAAP are sometimes required. The 
following modifying conventions give guidance and should be considered when deviating 
from what is generally acceptable. 
 
Conservatism 
When considering an accounting matter in which there are two alternatives that equally 
satisfy conceptual and implementation principles for a transaction, an accountant should

1.118                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
take a conservative approach, and follow the alternative that will have the least favorable 
impact on the net income of the entity. 
 
Industry Practices and Peculiarities 
The peculiarities and practices of an industry (such as banking, investment, and insurance) 
may warrant selective exceptions to accounting principles. Some differences in accounting 
also occur in response to legal requirements, such as those entities subject to regulatory 
controls.  
 
Substance over Form 
The economic substance of a transaction determines the accounting treatment, which may 
differ from the legal treatment. For example, although a lease contract may not transfer 
property rights, if the true substance of the transaction is a sale, then the lessee should 
record the transaction as an acquisition and capitalize the property.  
 
Application of Judgment 
An accountant may depart from GAAP if the results of departure appear reasonable under 
the circumstances, especially when strict adherence to GAAP will produce unreasonable 
results and the departure is properly disclosed.  
 
Materiality 
The amount of an item is material if its omission would affect the judgment of a reasonable 
person who is relying on the financial statements. The materiality threshold does not mean 
that immaterial items do not have to be recorded; rather, strict adherence to GAAP is 
necessary only when the item has a significant impact on the financial statements of an 
entity. In addition, the aggregate effect of immaterial items must also be considered. 
 
Cost-Benefit 
A departure from GAAP is permitted if the expected costs of reporting a transaction in 
compliance with GAAP exceed the expected benefits of compliance.
