3 | Check and Credit Card Fraud 11 | Persons who are expert at passing phony checks are sometimes called: | Paperhangers | Phonies | Launderers | Checksters | 1.1003 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Check and Credit Card Fraud | Check Theft; Check Fraud Schemes; Paperhangers | Paperhangers | Paperhangers Paperhangers are the experts of phony check passing. They frequently pick a particular establishment or store and observe its security methods. Any store that scrutinizes check writers’ identification is not a good target for a paperhanger. However, they will observe and select the least experienced or most lackadaisical of store employees to whom to pass the check. The paperhanger will then ask the clerk for cash back from the transaction and make the check out for an amount greater than the price of the purchase. In some cases, the checks being written are counterfeit; however, in other cases the checks are purposefully being written on a closed account. A variation of this scam is making a fraudulent deposit at a bank and asking for cash back. |
4 | Check and Credit Card Fraud 14 | The practice of recording the deposits of transfers between multiple bank accounts before recording the disbursements is called which of the following? | Kiting | An error | Lapping | Timing differences | 1.1004 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Check and Credit Card Fraud | Stop Payment Orders; Check Kiting; Demand Drafts | Check Kiting | Check Kiting Check kiting is one of the original white-collar crimes. It continues to survive even with a financial institution’s ability to detect kiting.

In 2007, an international task force monitored the mail in Africa, Europe, and North America and intercepted billions of dollars worth (face-value) of counterfeit checks. |
6 | Check and Credit Card Fraud 4 | One recent innovation has significantly reduced the incidence of check fraud among banks. This technique is which of the following? | Inkless fingerprints | Signature analysis | Electrostatic detection apparatus | Video spectral comparator | 1.1012 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Check and Credit Card Fraud | Check Fraud Prevention Tools; CHECK WRITING PENS; FINGERPRINT IDENTIFIERS; FORENSIC DOCUMENT EXAMINATION | FINGERPRINT IDENTIFIERS | FINGERPRINT IDENTIFIERS A biometric fingerprint identifier  requires the check writer to match fingerprints with the account holder’s, which are on file. Banks reported reductions in check fraud of 40 percent after the machine was introduced in the mid-1990s. | 
7 | Check and Credit Card Fraud 8 | Able, a Certified Fraud Examiner, is looking at a check that he suspects is forged. It appears that the forger may have used correction fluid to white out the name of the payee. Able decides that he needs to call in a forensic document specialist. The tool that the specialist will most likely use to reveal the use of correction fluid is a(n): | Video spectral comparator | Biometric fingerprint identifier | Electrostatic detection apparatus | Correction fluid analyzer | 1.1013 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Check and Credit Card Fraud | SIGNATURE; HANDWRITING; VIDEO SPECTRAL COMPARATOR; ELECTROSTATIC DETECTION APPARATUS | VIDEO SPECTRAL COMPARATOR | VIDEO SPECTRAL COMPARATOR Forensic examiners use this tool to test questionable documents.

Data-file label bypass options should be disabled. A data file management system should be used to record and locate all data files. Data file backup copies should be made and stored in a secure facility. Off-site backup file copies should be maintained in case of a disaster in the data center. Utilities that can modify data files should be removed from the system and used only under management supervision. Live data files should not be used for testing. | 
10 | Computer and Internet Fraud 42 | If a computer security system includes profiling software, which of the following characteristics would it test for authorized access? | Typing speed | Fingerprints | Signatures | Palm prints | 1.1841 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Computer and Internet Fraud | Other Network Security; The Risk Assessment Process | Other Network Security | Financial Transactions  Computer and Internet Fraud 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1841 Profiling software authenticates users by monitoring their statistical characteristics, such as typing speed and keystroke touch. Smart card access devices are similar to an ATM card; like ATM cards, they are susceptible to loss and forgery. | 
11 | Computer and Internet Fraud 8 | If you were responsible for investigating an alleged fraud in the design and installation of a new software application at your company, which of the following internal control systems would you review to determine whether the company's internal controls appeared adequate at the time of the alleged offense? | Implementation controls | System maintenance | Computer operations | System software controls | 1.1843 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Computer and Internet Fraud | Implementation Controls; Computer Operations; System Software; Data Files | Implementation Controls | Implementation Controls Implementation controls are those controls over the development of, or purchase of, a new application. All new system requests should be made in writing. A system development life-cycle methodology should be used for developing and implementing in-house or purchased packages. All new systems requests should be approved by the appropriate management level. Users should be involved in the project from design through final testing. All test results should be approved by both data center management and user personnel. There should be an implementation plan for placing the new system into production. |  
12 | Consumer Fraud 58 | In a/an __________________ scheme, the company that initially conned a consumer contacts that consumer and offers to help retrieve the lost money. However, the investigation requires an up-front fee and the consumer is again swindled. | Scavenger or revenge | Directory | Advance fee | Money manager | 1.1705 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Consumer Fraud | Money Manager or Financial Planner; Phone Card Schemes; Scavenger or Revenge Scheme; Sweepstakes, Giveaways, and Prizes; College Scholarship Services; Credit Repair; Other Con Schemes; Block Hustle | Scavenger or Revenge Scheme | Scavenger or Revenge Scheme This involves the company that initially conned the consumer.

Naturally, an up-front fee is required to finance the investigation. |  
13 | Contract and Procurement Fraud 15 | ABC, Inc and XYZ, Inc. are the only two companies in Lincoln County that lay asphalt. An audit reveals that the state is paying more for asphalt work in Lincoln County than in other counties in the state.

16 | Financial Institution Fraud 13 | The process of purchasing a home and reselling it at a higher price shortly thereafter is known as: | Property flipping | Strawman lending | Mortgage-backed security fraud | Mortgage-pulling | 1.923 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Financial Institution Fraud | Property Flipping; Nominee or Strawman Loans; Mortgage Pulling | Property Flipping | Property flipping is the process by which an investor purchases a home and then resells it at a higher price shortly thereafter. For example, an investor buys a house in need of work for $250,000 in July, renovates the kitchen and the bathrooms and landscapes the yard at a cost of $50,000, and then resells the house two months later (the time it takes to make the renovations) for a price that is reflective of the market for a house in its updated condition. This is a legitimate business transaction, and there are numerous individuals and groups in the real estate market who make an honest living flipping properties. |  
17 | Financial Institution Fraud 25 | You are a Certified Fraud Examiner who specializes in financial institution fraud prevention. One of your clients wants to auction off several large residential real estate holdings. Which of the following schemes would you be on the alert for? | Equity skimming | Land flips | Fraudulent present value calculations | Advance fee | 1.922 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Financial Institution Fraud | Equity Skimming | Equity Skimming | Equity Skimming Equity skimming is a scheme whereby an individual, entity, or group of individuals purchases one or several single-family homes.

18 | Financial Institution Fraud 27 | B.J., a Certified Fraud Examiner, is evaluating a portfolio of loans for his client, ABC Bank. ABC Bank recently acquired a new portfolio of consumer loans. B.J. notices that the loan package was sold without recourse to the broker, the brokerage fee was high relative to other purchases, and the broker is no longer in business. This particular loan portfolio is experiencing a higher than normal default rate. What type of scheme might B.J have uncovered? | Brokered loan fraud | Letter of credit fraud | Securities fraud | Money transfer fraud | 1.938 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Financial Institution Fraud | Detection; Advanced Fee Fraud; Red Flags | Brokered Loans | With residential loan packages, the broker sells the package, takes the money and disappears. Brokered loans are generally not sold with any recourse to the broker. Therefore, the purchaser must look to the borrower and the underlying collateral for debt satisfaction. With loan participations, the lead bank generally performs the underwriting. However, this does not relieve the participating bank from its obligation to perform its own due diligence. If the participating bank does not independently examine the documentation and perform its own due diligence, then fraud schemes on the part of the selling institution are possible. |  
19 | Financial Institution Fraud 31 | A bank or brokerage account showing little or no activity, presumably with small and without increasing balances, in which the account holder cannot be contacted would be defined as what type of account? | Dormant account | Active account | Defunct account | Fraudulent account | 1.902 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Financial Institution Fraud | False Accounting Entries; Unauthorized Withdrawals; Unauthorized Disbursement of Funds to Outsiders; Paying Personal Expenses from Bank Funds; Theft of Physical Property; Moving Money from Customers’ Dormant or Inactive Accounts; Unauthorized, Unrecorded Cash Payments; Theft and Other Unauthorized Use of Collateral | Moving Money from Customers Dormant or Inactive Accounts | Moving Money from Customers’ Dormant or Inactive Accounts Persons with apparent authority create journal entries or transfer orders not initiated by customers to move money among accounts. Dormant or inactive accounts are those that show little or no activity. Often contact with the account holder by confirmation, letter, or telephone contact is not possible. Such accounts are to be transferred to dual control and recorded in an inactive accounts ledger. State statutes usually provide for escheat or forfeiture to the state after a period of years. | 
20 | Financial Institution Fraud 8 | Which of the following usually represents the highest risk for fraud in financial institutions? | Loan fraud | False statements | Embezzlement | Teller fraud | 1.903 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Financial Institution Fraud | Detection Methods; Loan Fraud; Financial Institution Failures as a Result of Real Estate Loan Fraud; Common Loan Fraud Schemes; Loans to Nonexistent Borrowers; Sham Loans with Kickbacks and Diversion | Loan Fraud | Loan Fraud Loan fraud is a multifaceted activity that includes several types of criminal activities.

Although the number of occurrences might be small, the dollar amount per occurrence tends to be large. | 
21 | Financial Statement Fraud 1 | Recording expenses in the wrong period and early revenue recognition are classified as what type of financial fraud scheme? | Timing differences | Improper asset valuations | Fictitious revenues | Improper disclosures | 1.312 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Financial Statement Fraud | Timing Differences (Including Premature Revenue Recognition); Premature Revenue Recognition; PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT DOES NOT EXIST | Timing Differences (Including Premature Revenue Recognition) | Timing Differences (Including Premature Revenue Recognition)  Financial statement fraud might also involve timing differences, that is, the recording of revenues or expenses in improper periods.

23 | Financial Statement Fraud 2 | Vertical analysis is a technique for analyzing the relationships between items on an income statement or balance sheet by expressing all components as percentages. When using vertical analysis of an income statement, which of the following components is assigned 100 percent? | Net sales | Total assets | Gross sales | Net assets | 1.335 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Financial Statement Fraud | Financial Statement Analysis; Percentage Analysis — Horizontal and Vertical | Percentage Analysis — Horizontal and Vertical | Percentage Analysis — Horizontal and Vertical  There are traditionally two methods of percentage analysis of financial statements. Vertical analysis  is a technique for analyzing the relationships between the items on an income statement, balance sheet, or statement of cash flows by expressing components as percentages. This method is often referred to as “common sizing” financial statements. In the vertical analysis of an income statement, net sales is assigned 100 percent. For a balance sheet, total assets is assigned 100 percent on the asset side, and total liabilities and equity is expressed as 100 percent. All other items in each of the sections are expressed as a percentage of these numbers. | 
24 | Financial Statement Fraud 20 | Financial statement analysis is defined as the examination of relationships between key figures on the financial statements and between amounts on successive financial statements. Which of the following is a technique for analyzing the percentage change in individual income statement or balance sheet items from one year to the next? | Horizontal analysis | Ratio analysis | Vertical analysis | Statistical sampling | 1.335 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Financial Statement Fraud | Financial Statement Analysis; Percentage Analysis — Horizontal and Vertical | Percentage Analysis — Horizontal and Vertical | Horizontal analysis  is a technique for analyzing the percentage change in individual financial statement items from one period to the next. The first period in the analysis is considered the base period, and the changes in the subsequent period are computed as a percentage of the base period. If more than two periods are presented, each period’s changes are computed as a percentage of the preceding period. As is the case with vertical analysis, this technique will not work for small, immaterial frauds. |  
25 | Health Care Fraud 22 | Falsified prescriptions, excessive supplies, milk supplement scams, lymphedema pumps, and scooter scams are forms of fraud commonly involving what type of health care entity? | Durable medical equipment suppliers | Out-patient services groups | Workers' compensation carriers | Hospitals | 1.1217 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Health Care Fraud | Durable Medical Equipment Suppliers; Home Health Companies; Pharmacy | Durable Medical Equipment Suppliers | Durable Medical Equipment Suppliers Fraud schemes perpetrated by suppliers of durable medical equipment frequently involve: • Falsified prescriptions. • Excessive supplies. • Equipment not delivered or billed before delivery. • Billing for equipment rental after equipment was returned. • Noncovered supplies,(for example, incontinent care kits). • Milk supplement scam. • Lymphedema pumps. • Scooter scam. | 
26 | Health Care Fraud 39 | Billing for a higher level of medical service than was actually rendered is called which of the following? | Upcoding | Global service period violation | Fragmenting | Uplinking | 1.1227 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Health Care Fraud | Global Service Period Violations; Upcoding; Misuse of New Patient Codes; Insured Fraud; Doctor/ER Shopping | Upcoding | Upcoding Upcoding is billing for a higher level of service than was rendered.

27 | Insurance Fraud 16 | One type of vehicle insurance scam involves the owner of the vehicle cashing in on an insurance policy by abandoning the vehicle and falsely reporting it stolen. This type of scam is called: | Ditching | Churning | Sliding | Twisting | 1.1105 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Insurance Fraud | Sliding; Twisting; Churning; Vehicle Insurance Schemes; Ditching; Past Posting | Ditching | Ditching Ditching, also known as owner give-ups, is getting rid of a vehicle to cash in on an insurance policy or to settle an outstanding loan. The vehicle is normally expensive and purchased with a small down payment. The vehicle is reported stolen, although in some cases, the owner just abandons the vehicle hoping that it is stolen, stripped for parts, or taken to a pound and destroyed. The scheme sometimes involves homeowner’s insurance for the property that was “stolen” in the vehicle. |  
28 | Insurance Fraud 4 | The indemnity against loss to a third party when the insured fails to fulfill a specific undertaking for the third party's benefit is referred to as: | An indemnity bond | Fidelity insurance | Casualty insurance | Disability insurance | 1.1101 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Insurance Fraud | INSURANCE FRAUD; Types of Insurance Policies | Types of Insurance Policies | Disability insurance indemnifies against income loss under defined circumstances. Life insurance indemnifies for the death of the insured. Fidelity insurance indemnifies against economic loss to the insured because of employee dishonesty. Bonds indemnify against loss to third-party beneficiaries when the insured fails to fulfill a specific undertaking for the third  party’s benefit. |  
29 | Inventory and Other Assets 29 | Black's Law Dictionary defines which of the following as "felonious stealing, taking and carrying... away another's personal property with intent to convert it or deprive the owner thereof? | Larceny | Stealing | Theft | Skimming | 1.602 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Inventory and Other Assets | Theft of Inventory and Other Assets; Larceny Schemes | Larceny Schemes | Larceny Schemes  The textbook definition of larceny is “Felonious stealing, taking and carrying, leading, riding, or driving away another’s personal property, with intent to convert it or to deprive owner thereof. The unlawful taking and carrying away of property of another with intent to appropriate it to use inconsistent with latter’s rights.” 1 This definition is so broad, it encompasses every kind of asset theft. In order to gain a more specific understanding of the methods used to steal inventory and other assets, the definition of larceny has been restricted. For the purposes of classifying asset misappropriations, the term larceny is meant to refer to the most basic type of inventory theft, the schemes in which an employee simply takes inventory from the company premises without attempting to conceal the theft in the books and records. (See “Non-cash Larceny” flowchart.) In other fraud schemes, employees may create false documentation to justify the shipment of merchandise or tamper with inventory records to conceal missing assets. Larceny schemes are more blunt. The culprit in these crimes takes company assets without trying to “justify” their absence. |   
30 | Money Laundering 15 | The stage in which money laundering schemes are most often detected is called: | Placement | Integration | Washing | Layering | 1.1601 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Money Laundering | MONEY LAUNDERING; Introduction; The Money Laundering Process; Placement | Placement | Placement Placement of funds into a financial institution is the initial step in the process. It is at this step that legislation has been developed to prevent launderers from depositing or converting large amounts of cash at financial institutions or taking cash out of the country. Money laundering schemes are most often detected at this stage. |  
31 | Money Laundering 16 | XYZ Company deposits an extra $20,000 a month in its bank account although there are no recorded sales for that amount. At the end of the year, the company has an extra $240,000 in its account. This type of money laundering scheme is most properly referred to as: | Balance sheet laundering | Overstatement of reported expenses | Overstatement of reported revenues | Smurfing | 1.1604 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Money Laundering | Overstatement of Reported Expenses; Depositing Cash and Writing Checks in Excess of Reported Revenues and Expenses (Balance Sheet Laundering) | Depositing Cash and Writing Checks in Excess of Reported Revenues and Expenses (Balance Sheet Laundering) | Depositing Cash and Writing Checks in Excess of Reported Revenues and Expenses (Balance Sheet Laundering) Rather than attempting to disguise money as normal business revenue, excess funds can simply be deposited into the bank account of the business. This technique is known as Financial Transactions  Money Laundering 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1605 balance sheet laundering because it is independent of the money that flows in and out of  the business. |
32 | Money Laundering 2 | The use of a legitimate business enterprise as a front to conceal and co-mingle illicit dollars is an example of what type of scheme? | Money laundering | Fictitious vendor | Fictitious trade payable | Money hiding | 1.1603 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Money Laundering | Using a Legitimate Business to Launder Funds; Overstatement of Reported Revenues | Using a Legitimate Business to Launder Funds | Using a Legitimate Business to Launder Funds One of the most common methods of laundering funds is to filter the money through a legitimate business, otherwise known as a “front” business. A front business can be a very effective way to launder money because it provides a safe place for organizing and managing criminal activity, where the comings and goings of large numbers of people will not arouse undue suspicion. In addition, a front that does legitimate business provides cover for delivery and transportation related to illegal activity. The expenses from illegal activity can be attributed to the legitimate enterprise, and illegal revenues can be easily placed into the enterprise. |
33 | Money Laundering 20 | The title of the Congressional legislation passed in October of 2001 that aimed to curtail money laundering, particularly to prevent financing of terrorist activities, is referred to as which of the following? | The USA PATRIOT Act | The Anti-Money Laundering Act | The Anti-Terrorism Act | The Privacy Act | 1.1615 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Money Laundering | Signs of a Hawala Exchange; Federal and State Law; PATRIOT Act of 2001 | PATRIOT Act of 2001 | PATRIOT Act of 2001 On October 26, 2001, President George W. Bush signed into law the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act  (the PATRIOT Act). The PATRIOT Act was a response to the tragedies of September 11, 2001, and reflected Congressional concern with the money laundering activities of the terrorists who committed those attacks. |   
34 | Money Laundering 4 | Page, a Certified Fraud Examiner is investigating the sources of income of a suspect. Page notices that funds available to the suspect include the suspect's interest in a restaurant/bar. Page has surveyed the establishment several times and notices that the business, even during peak times, is minimal. Yet the income reported from this restaurant/bar is phenomenal. Of the following list, which scheme might the suspect be involved in? | Money laundering | Overstatement of expenses | Conflict of interest | Bankruptcy fraud | 1.1601 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Money Laundering | MONEY LAUNDERING; Introduction; The Money Laundering Process; Placement | Introduction | Introduction Money laundering is the disguising of the existence, nature, source, ownership, location, and disposition of property derived from criminal activity. Although it is not currently possible to quantify the total volume of money laundered globally or in the U.S., it is clearly an enormous problem existing within every financial system. Nevertheless, the continuing demand to know how much money is laundered annually has led many organizations to calculate and offer their own estimations. For example, the International Monetary Fund estimated that money laundering caused a total monetary loss of $590 billion to $1.5 trillion globally in 1996, the United Nations estimated a loss of $500 billion to $1 trillion globally in 2005, and a 2007 KPMG survey found that money-laundering flows exceed $1 trillion per year. |

SROs oversee the markets they operate and police the member firms participating in those markets. SROs create and enforce rules dealing with such areas as securities listings, exchange and settlement procedures, and member qualifications.  The Maloney Act of 1938 amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to allow the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) to regulate the business of members subject to Securities and Exchange Commission oversight.   In 2007, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) was created through the consolidation of NASD and the member regulation, enforcement, and arbitration functions of the New York Stock Exchange. FINRA is dedicated to investor protection and market integrity through effective and efficient regulation and complementary compliance and technology-based services. |

Although the original provisions of section 802 only Securities Fraud  Financial Transactions   1.1512                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  required a retention period of five years, the SEC extended the requirement to be consistent with the seven-year retention period required under the Auditing Standards promulgated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) per section 103 of the Act. Violations of the final SEC rules may be punished by fines up to $250,000 and up to 10 years in jail for individuals, or fines up to $500,000 for corporations. | 
41 | Securities Fraud 21 | Under the Sarbanes-Oxiey Act, which of the following is responsible for establishing procedures for receiving and dealing with complaints and anonymous employee tips regarding irregularities in the company's accounting methods, internal controls, or auditing matters? | Audit committee | Internal auditor | Board of directors | Chief executive officer | 1.1507 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Securities Fraud | Enhanced Financial Disclosure Requirements; OFF-BALANCE SHEET  TRANSACTIONS | Standards for Audit Committee Independence | ESTABLISHING A WHISTLEBLOWING STRUCTURE The Act makes it the responsibility of the audit committee to establish procedures (e.g., a hotline) for receiving and dealing with complaints and anonymous employee tips regarding irregularities in the company’s accounting methods, internal controls, or auditing matters. |  
42 | Securities Fraud 22 | One type of securities fraud involves brokers who engage in excessive trading of a customer account to create commissions for themselves and their firms. This type of fraud is called which of the following? | Churning | Front running | Conversion | Parking | 1.1531 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Securities Fraud | Securities Fraud Schemes; Securities Fraud by Registered Persons and Entities; Churning; DEFINITION OF EXCESSIVE TRADING ACTIVITY | Churning | Churning  Churning is the excessive trading of a customer account for the purpose of generating commissions. For securities and options there is a commission charged when the trade is entered into and when the trade is liquidated. Commodity futures have a round-turn commission scheme meaning that the commission covers both the purchase and sale. Commissions on commodity futures are not charged until the trade is closed out. | 
43 | Securities Fraud 26 | The ______________ test is an alternative to the Howey test that many courts use in securities fraud cases. | Risk Capital | Investment skills | Profit management | Risk management | 1.1518 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Securities Fraud | Risk Capital Test; Examples of Investment Contracts; PONZI SCHEMES | Risk Capital Test | Risk Capital Test  As an alternative to the Howey Test many state and federal courts are using the so-called “Risk Capital Test.” This “test” allows the invest or to play a more active role if the funds he contributes are part of the “risk capital” of the business. A person entrusts money or other capital to another with the expectation of deriving a profit. The failure or success of the venture is dependent upon the managerial efforts of the other person. Several states have formally adopted this test, sometimes known as the Hawaii Market Test, as an alternative definition of investment contract. However, the Supreme Court has expressly declined to decide if this test should be used. | 
44 | Securities Fraud 28 | A financial advisor knows of a large order to sell a particular security. Knowing the order will certainly cause the stock price to fall, the advisor sells his shares of the stock at the higher price before he places the customer's order. This practice is called: | Front running | Conversion | Parking | Churning | 1.1534 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Securities Fraud | Failure to Supervise; Failure to Report Client Complaints; Parking; Front Running — Dual Trading | Front Running — Dual Trading | Front Running — Dual Trading Front running an order is a type of insider trading. Although it usually will not cause a direct loss to the customer, it could, and is a violation of exchange rules. Front running involves the use for profit of the privileged knowledge of a customer’s order to buy or sell a large amount of a commodity, options, or security that, because of its size, is likely to move the market. Back office personnel could have knowledge of such an order and buy or sell for their own account ahead of the customer. Because order fillers on the exchange floor are allowed to trade for their own account and fill orders for customers (dual trading) they also have an opportunity.   Financial Transactions  Securities Fraud 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1535 Consider the following scenario: an order is received from a hedger to sell 500 December cattle futures contracts at the market. If the order filler knows that current market conditions are such that this order will move the market significantly lower, it would be very tempting to sell a few contracts for himself and profit from the market decline when he executes the customer order. Order fillers are required to operate in the best interest of the customer and “work” the order to get the best price. However, once the trader has established his short position, it is really in his own interest to drive the market as far down as possible when executing the 500 contract sell order. In this situation, the order filler may not give his best efforts and could hurt the customer. | 
45 | Securities Fraud 29 | The Securities Act of 1933 is also known as the __________________. | Truth in Securities Act | Investment Fraud Prevention Act | Truth in Lending Act | SEC Creation Act | 1.1501 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Securities Fraud | SECURITIES FRAUD; Introduction; Federal Regulation; Securities Act of 1933 | Securities Act of 1933 | Securities Act of 1933 Concern over the 1929 stock market crash and over the manipulation of the securities markets precipitated the need for federal intervention. In 1933, the Securities Act was enacted to regulate the public offering of securities and protect investors. The 1933 Act, sometimes known as the “Truth in Securities Act,” defines securities to include: |
46 | Securities Fraud 32 | Section 1107 of Sarbanes-Oxley, codified in Title 18, U.S.C., å¤ 1513, makes it a crime to knowingly, with the intent to retaliate, take any harmful action against a person for providing truthful information relating to the commission or possible commission of any _____________ offense. | Federal | Mail fraud | Securities | Money laundering | 1.1510 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Securities Fraud | Protections for Corporate Whistleblowers Under Sarbanes-Oxley | Protections for Corporate Whistleblowers Under Sarbanes-Oxley | CIVIL LIABILITY WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION Section 806 of the Act, which is codified at Title 18, U.S.C., § 1514A, creates civil liability for companies that retaliate against whistleblowers. It should be noted that this provision does not provide universal whistleblower protection; it  only protects employees of publicly traded companies. Section 806 makes it unlawful to fire, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner discriminate against an employee for providing information or aiding in an investigation of securities fraud. In order to trigger § 806 protections, the employee must report the suspected misconduct to a federal regulatory or law enforcement agency, a member of Congress or a committee of Congress, or a supervisor. Employees are also protected against retaliation for filing, testifying in, participating in, or otherwise assisting in a Securities Fraud  Financial Transactions   1.1510                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  proceeding filed or about to be filed relating to an alleged violation of securities laws or  SEC rules. |

SROs oversee the markets they operate and police the member firms participating in those markets. SROs create and enforce rules dealing with such areas as securities listings, exchange and settlement procedures, and member qualifications.  The Maloney Act of 1938 amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to allow the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) to regulate the business of members subject to Securities and Exchange Commission oversight.   In 2007, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) was created through the consolidation of NASD and the member regulation, enforcement, and arbitration functions of the New York Stock Exchange. FINRA is dedicated to investor protection and market integrity through effective and efficient regulation and complementary compliance and technology-based services. |  
48 | Securities Fraud 6 | To determine if a misrepresentation is ___________________, the fraud examiner should ask, "Would a reasonable investor wish to know this information in order to make an informed decision?" | Material | Promotional | Relevant | Privileged | 1.1543 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Securities Fraud | Disclosures (Misrepresentations and Omissions) | Disclosures (Misrepresentations and Omissions) | As a general rule, the examiner or investigator needs to determine the answer to the following question: Would a reasonable investor wish to know this information in order to make an informed decision? If the answer is “yes,” then this information, or the lack thereof, has a high likelihood of being deemed material. (If an actual investor acted based on the misrepresentation, that clearly strengthens the case, but it is not essential that the false or misleading statement influenced an investor, merely that a reasonable investor could have been so influenced.) |
49 | Tax Fraud 19 | Which of the following is an appropriate defense to tax fraud penalties? | Mental illness | Amended return | Bankruptcy | Death of the taxpayer | 1.1411 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Tax Fraud | Reliance on an Attorney or Accountant; Inappropriate Defenses; Amended or Delinquent Return; Statute of Limitations; Death of Taxpayer; Bankruptcy; Evidence of Tax Fraud | Mental Illness | Mental Illness This defense is applicable in regard to the time the return was prepared. |

52 | Theft of Intellectual Property 11 | Document classification is an important part of any plan to safeguard valuable corporate information. It is recommended that trade secrets be classified as which of the following: | Authorized access only | For your eyes only | Private | Restrictred | 1.880 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Theft of Intellectual Property | Document Classification; Visitors; Offices; Maintenance Workers; Meeting Rooms | Document Classification | Document Classification Document classification is also an important area in a protection plan. Working closely with each department, proprietary documents should be classified according to the level of security that best meets the company’s need s. For instance, documents may be labeled “private” for personnel matters and move up to “restricted” for pricing or marketing information. Trade secrets or highly sensitive information might be labeled “authorized access only.” Notes and drafts of documents should also be safeguarded or destroyed when the final document is completed. |  
53 | Criminology 14 | Funds are missing from the bank account of ABC Co. The fraud examiner assigned to the case begins thinking, "Who had the opportunity and the motive to get at this money"? Probably unknowingly, the fraud examiner is performing a __________________ analysis. | Behaviorist | Theorist | Empirical | Categorical | 4.101 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Criminology | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence; UNDERSTANDING HUMAN BEHAVIOR; Behavioral Analysis and the Detection of Fraud | Behavioral Analysis and the Detection of Fraud | Behavioral Analysis and the Detection of Fraud When a detective searches for a suspect’s motive, the detective is using behaviorist methods of analysis. The suspect, it is assumed, was stimulated by some arrangement of factors. Many courses in criminology are built around the fundamental premise that crimes are particular sorts of behavior and best understood as the product of operant conditioning. Fraud examiners often use the same methods in approaching a case. When money is missing, the examiner traces the known flow of funds and then asks, “Who had the opportunity and the motive to get at this money?” Even without being conscious of the fact, the examiner is performing a behaviorist analysis on the crime. |
54 | Criminology 3 | Behavioral studies show that ________________ is the least effective method of changing behavior. | Punishment | Rewards | Positive reinforcement | Conditioning | 4.102 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Criminology | Behavioral Analysis and the Detection of Fraud | Behavioral Analysis and the Detection of Fraud | Behavioral studies such as those conducted by Skinner show that punishment is the least effective method of changing behavior. Punishing brings “a temporary suppression of the behavior,” but only with constant supervision and application. In repeated experiments, Skinner found that punishment — either applying a negative stimulus, or taking away a positive one — effectively extinguished a subject’s behavior, but that the behavior returned “when the punishment was discontinued... and eventually all responses came out” again. The subject would suppress the behavior as long as the punishment was applied directly and continually, but as soon as the punishment was withdrawn for a while, the behavior was attempted again; if there was no punishment following the attempt, the subject began to behave as before. |   
55 | Ethics for Fraud Examiners 3 | How many years of professional experience are required in order to be awarded the Certified Fraud Examiner designation? | Two | Four | One | Three | 4.1003 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Ethics for Fraud Examiners | Professional Admission Standards; Social Recognition: A Reciprocal Relationship | Professional Admission Standards | Experience is required for many, but not all, professional licenses and certifications. Experience of one or two years is required in most states for the CPA certificate. Experience is required to obtain the Certified Internal Auditor designation. Designation as a Certified Fraud Examiner requires at least two years of experience in combination with other qualifications. |  
56 | Ethics for Fraud Examiners 4 | Under the ACFE Code of Professional Ethics, evidence and conclusions are considered __________________ if knowledge of them would affect clients' decisions based on a Certified Fraud Examiner's report. | Material | Extraneous | Confidential | Opinions | 4.1020 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Ethics for Fraud Examiners | Professional Improvement | Complete Reporting of Material Matters | ACFE Code of Professional Ethics   Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 4.1020   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     Evidence and conclusions are material if knowledge of them would affect clients’ decisions based on a Certified Fraud Examiner’s report. Materiality  is a user-oriented concept. If matters omitted from a report were known to the users, and their own perceptions and conclusions would be different in light of this knowledge, the omitted information is material. Certified Fraud Examiners are placed in the difficult position of determining not what they themselves consider important and material, but rather what they think users will consider important and material. They need to project a decision-making process onto the users instead of simply being introspective. |  
57 | Fraud Prevention Programs 19 | The COSO report suggests that ___________________ be responsible for the control environment of an organization. | Upper management | Individual employees | Middle management | Department heads | 4.704 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Fraud Prevention Programs | Control Environment | Control Environment | COSO envisions that upper management will be  responsible for the control environment of organizations. Employees look to management for guidance in most business affairs, and organizational ethics are no different. It is important for upper management to operate in an ethical manner, and it is equally important for employees to view management in a positive light. Managers must set an appropriate moral tone for the operations of an organization. |  
58 | Fraud Risk Assessment 11 | In response to a risk identified during a fraud risk assessment, management may decide to purchase fidelity insurance or a bond to help protect the company against the associated risk of loss. This response is known as: | Transferring the risk | Avoiding the risk | Assuming the risk | Mitigating the risk | 4.822 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Fraud Risk Assessment | Avoid the Risk; Transfer the Risk; Mitigate the Risk; Assume the Risk; Combination Approach | Transfer the Risk | Transfer the Risk  Management may transfer some or all of the risk by purchasing fidelity insurance or a bond. The cost to the organization is the premium paid for the insurance or bond. The covered risk of loss is then transferred to the insurance company, less any deductible payment included in the contract. | 
59 | Fraud Risk Assessment 22 | __________________ controls are designed to stop something bad from happening before it occurs, while _________________ controls are designed to identify something bad that has already occurred. | Preventive; detective | Detective; investigative | Investigative; detective | Investigative; deterrent | 4.802 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Fraud Risk Assessment | The Business It Is In; The Environment in Which It Operates; The Effectiveness of Internal Controls Within the Business Processes; The Ethics and Values of the Company and the People Within It | The Effectiveness of Internal Controls Within the Business Processes | The Effectiveness of Internal Controls Within the Business Processes  A good system of internal controls, with the right balance of preventive and detective controls, can greatly reduce an organization’s vulnerability to fraud. Preventive controls  are those manual or automated processes that stop something bad from happening before it occurs. Detective controls  can also be manual or automated, but are designed to identify something bad that has already occurred. No system of internal controls can fully eliminate the risk of fraud, but well-designed and effective internal controls can deter the average fraudster by reducing the opportunity to commit the fraud. |  
60 | Fraud Risk Assessment 24 | Theft of competitor trade secrets, anti-competitive practices, environmental violations, and trade and customs regulations in areas of import and export are all fraud risks pertaining to: | Regulatory and legal misconduct | Asset misappropriation | Fraudulent financial reporting | Reputation risk | 4.815 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Fraud Risk Assessment | ASSET MISAPPROPRIATIONS; CORRUPTION; REGULATORY AND LEGAL MISCONDUCT; REPUTATION RISK | REGULATORY AND LEGAL MISCONDUCT | REGULATORY AND LEGAL MISCONDUCT  Regulatory and legal misconduct includes a wide range of risks, such as conflicts of interest, insider trading, theft of competitor trade secrets, anti-competitive practices, environmental violations, and trade and customs regulations in areas of import and export. Depending on the particular organization and the nature of its business, some or all of these risks may be applicable and should be considered in the fraud risk assessment process. | 
61 | Fraud Risk Assessment 28 | In response to a risk identified during a fraud risk assessment, management may decide to eliminate an asset or exit an activity if the control measures required to protect the organization against the identified threat are too expensive. This response is known as: | Avoiding the risk | Transferring the risk | Mitigating the risk | Assuming the risk | 4.822 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Fraud Risk Assessment | Avoid the Risk; Transfer the Risk; Mitigate the Risk; Assume the Risk; Combination Approach | Avoid the Risk | Avoid the Risk  Management may decide to avoid the risk by eliminating an asset or exiting an activity if the control measures required to protect the organization against an identified threat are too expensive. This approach requires the fraud risk assessment team to complete a cost-benefit analysis of the value of the asset or activity to the organization compared to the cost of implementing measures to protect the asset or activity. |  
62 | Fraud Risk Assessment 31 | The risk that an organization may be victimized by an individual who is able to overcome the three elements of the fraud triangle is called | Fraud risk | Environmental risk | Audit risk | Insider Risk | 4.801 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Fraud Risk Assessment | FRAUD RISK ASSESSMENT; What Is Fraud Risk?; Why Should an Organization Be Concerned About Fraud Risk? | What is Fraud Risk? | What Is Fraud Risk? Cressey’s fraud triangle teaches us that there are three interrelated elements that enable someone to commit fraud: the motive  that drives a person to want to commit the fraud, the opportunity  that enables him to commit the fraud, and the ability to rationalize  the fraudulent behavior. The vulnerability that an organization has to those capable of overcoming all three elements of the fraud triangle is fraud risk. Fraud risk can come from sources both internal and external to the organization. |  
63 | Fraud Risk Assessment 4 | _____________________ is a process aimed at proactively identifying and addressing an organization's vulnerabilities to internal and external fraud | A fraud risk assessment | A fraud examination | An internal control audit | A management assessment | 4.803 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Fraud Risk Assessment | What Is a Fraud Risk Assessment?; What Is the Objective of a Fraud Risk Assessment?; Why Should Organizations Conduct Fraud Risk Assessments?; Improve Communication and Awareness About Fraud | What is a Fraud Risk Assessment? | What Is a Fraud Risk Assessment?  Fraud risk assessment  is a process aimed at proactively identifying and addressing an organization’s vulnerabilities to internal and external fraud. As every organization is different, the fraud risk assessment process is often more an art than a science. What gets evaluated and how it gets assessed should be tailored to the organization — there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Additionally, organizational fraud risks continually change. It is therefore important to think about a fraud risk assessment as an ongoing, continuous process, rather than just an activity. |   
64 | Fraud Risk Assessment 8 | In response to a risk identified during a fraud risk assessment, management may decide to implement appropriate countermeasures, such as prevention and detection controls. This response is known as: | Mitigating the risk | Transferring the risk | Avoiding the risk | Assuming the risk | 4.822 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Fraud Risk Assessment | Avoid the Risk; Transfer the Risk; Mitigate the Risk; Assume the Risk; Combination Approach | Mitigate the Risk | Mitigate the Risk  Management can help mitigate the risk by implementing appropriate countermeasures, such as prevention and detection controls. The fraud risk assessment team should evaluate each countermeasure to determine if it is cost effective and reasonable given the probability of occurrence and impact of loss. |  
65 | Fraud Risk Assessment 9 | ______________________ enable the fraud risk assessor to observe the interactions of employees as they discuss a question or issue. | Focus groups | Surveys | Anonymous feedback mechanisms | Interviews | 4.810 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Fraud Risk Assessment | Interviews; Focus Groups; Surveys | Focus Groups | Focus Groups  Focus groups enable the assessor to observe the interactions of employees as they discuss a question or issue. Some topics may lend themselves to being discussed in an open forum in which people feel comfortable among their colleagues. Additionally, when discussing tough or thorny issues in a group, an anonymous, real-time voting tool can be an effective way of opening up a dialogue among the participants. |   
66 | Occupational Fraud 11 | According to the 2010 Report to the Nations, Certified Fraud Examiners estimate organizations lose __________ percent of revenues to fraud and abuse each year. | 5 | 4 | 10 | 2 | 4.621 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Occupational Fraud | Distribution of Dollar Losses | Measuring the Cost of Occupational Fraud | We asked each CFE who participated in our survey to provide his best estimate of the percentage of annual revenues that the typical organization loses to fraud in a given year. Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Occupational Fraud 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    4.621  The median response was that the average organization annually loses 5% of its revenues to fraud. Applying this percentage to the 2009 estimated Gross World Product of $58.07 trillion would result in a projected total global fraud loss of more than $2.9 trillion. |  
69 | Occupational Fraud 28 | According to the 2010 Report to the Nations, which of the following is the most common fraud detection method? | Tip | Accident | External audit | Notified by law enforcement | 4.628 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Occupational Fraud | SOURCE OF TIPS | Detection of Fraud Schemes | Detection of Fraud Schemes One of the principal goals of our research is to identify how past frauds were detected so that organizations can apply that knowledge to their future anti-fraud efforts. Tips were by far the most common detection method in our study, catching nearly three times as many frauds as any other form of detection. This is consistent with the findings in our prior reports. Tips have been far and away the most common means of detection in every study since 2002, when we began tracking the data. |   
72 | Organizational Crime 22 | White-collar offenses by organizations are more likely to be punished by | Administrative and/or civil penalties | Administrative penalties | Criminal penalties | Civil penalties | 4.501 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Organizational Crime | ORGANIZATIONAL CRIME | ORGANIZATIONAL CRIME | Organizational crime occurs in the context of  complex relationships and expectations among boards of directors, executives, and managers on the one hand, and among parent corporations, corporate divisions, and subsidiaries on the other. White-collar crime is distinguished from lower socioeconomic crimes in terms of the structure of the violation and the fact that administrative and civil penalties are more likely to be used as punishment than are criminal penalties. |  
73 | Organizational Crime 27 | Two criminologists conducted a comprehensive study of Fortune 500 companies. They discovered that 60 percent of the firms had at least one white-collar crime case filed against them in the two-year period of the study. These two criminologists are: | Clinard and Yeager | Weisburd and Bode | Hagan and Nagel | Albonetti and Wheeler | 4.504 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Organizational Crime | Clinard and Yeager | Clinard and Yeager | Clinard and Yeager In a comprehensive study of corporate law-breaking, Marshall Clinard (a recipient of the Association’s Donald Cressey Award) and Peter Yeager examined over a two-year period the records of 562 companies (477 of which were on the Fortune 500  list) and found that l,553 white-collar crime cases had been filed against them. Some 60 percent of the firms had at least one case against them; for those companies, the average number of violations was 4.4. The oil, pharmaceutical, and motor vehicle industries were the most likely to be charged for wrongdoing, a matter that may be a function of enforcement priorities or a true reflection of their activities. |   
74 | Organizational Crime 28 | Under the Corporate Sentencing Guidelines, a corporation convicted of a felony is required to serve a probation between: | One and five years | One and ten years | One and three years | Five and ten years | 4.523 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Organizational Crime | Probation | Probation | When the offending organization has committed a felony, probation must run for at least one year. In no case may probation run for more than five years. The Guidelines also recommend conditions for probation in various circumstances. These conditions include:  • Publicizing the nature of the offense, the organization’s conviction, the punishment imposed, and the steps taken to prevent the recurrence of a similar offense • Providing periodic reports to the court of the organization’s financial condition and expenses • Requiring the organization to submit to examinations of the organization’s business records and to interviews of knowledgeable employees • Requiring the organization to notify the court upon learning of a material adverse change to its financial condition or the commencement of any major legal proceedings, including bankruptcy, or any investigation by authorities • Requiring periodic payments under the court’s specifications, with priority in the order of restitution, fine, and any other monetary sanction • Developing a program to avoid violations of law and a schedule to implement it • Notifying the organization’s employees and shareholders of its violation and its program to avoid and detect violations of law Organizational Crime  Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 4.524   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     • Reporting to the court on the organization’s implementation of a program to avoid and detect violations of law and disclosing any investigation by authorities |  
75 | Punishment 9 | In the area of criminal justice, _______________________ is the planned release and community supervision of incarcerated offenders before the actual expiration of their prison sentence. | Parole | Pardon | Probation | Community release | 4.314 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Punishment | Community-Based Corrections; Parole; Pardons | Parole | Parole  Parole (derived from the French and meaning “word,” as in “word of honor”) is the planned release and community supervision of offenders before the expiration of their sentence. Under most state laws, an offender is eligible for parole after serving one-third of his sentence. Parole decisions usually are made by a board or a commission, based on its members’ conclusion regarding whether the offe nder will remain at liberty without violating the law. There is pressure on parole board members to be notably conservative in their actions, because any repetition of an offense by someone they release, particularly if the offense is heinous, will trigger community outrage against the board. On the other hand, overcrowded prison conditions dictate early release to make room for newcomers. |  
76 | White-Collar Crime 13 | According to Reiss and Biderman, __________________________ violations are those violations of law to which penalties are attached that involve the use of a violator's position of economic power, influence, or trust in the legitimate economic or political institutional order for the purpose of illegal gain, or to commit an illegal act for personal or organizational gain. | White-collar crime | Organized crime | Environmental crime | Violent crime | 4.402 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | White-Collar Crime | What is White-Collar Crime? | What is White-Collar Crime? | Though there is no consensus within the scholarly community, one definition today of white-collar crime is that proposed by Albert J. Reiss, Jr. and Albert Biderman:  White-collar crime violations are those violations of law to which penalties are attached that involve the use of a violator’s position of econom ic power, influence, or trust in the legitimate economic or political institutional order for the purpose of illegal gain, or to commit an illegal act for personal or organizational gain. 2 |    
77 | Covert Examinations 2 | Which of the following types of informants is directly involved in the offense? | Accomplice/witness informant | Basic lead informant | Covert informant | Participant informant | 3.312 | Investigation | Covert Examinations | Sources and Informants; Types of Informants; Basic Lead Informants | Accomplice-Witness Informants | Accomplice/Witness Informants The accomplice/witness informant is called upon by investigators quite often to provide information on criminal activity. The distinction in this category is that if the accomplice/witness informant were not feeding information to investigators, he would be liable to be prosecuted for the same offense. The accomplice informant is often persuaded to “spill the beans” on a co-conspirator in exchange for leniency in the prosecution phase of the investigation. | 
78 | Sources of Information 47 | A suspect's Social Security number can most easily be obtained through which of the following online searches? | Credit bureau header search | Voter registration search | Motor vehicle record search | Court judgment search | 3.518 | Investigation | Sources of Information | Locating People Using Online Records; CREDIT HEADER SEARCHES | CREDIT HEADER SEARCHES | CREDIT HEADER SEARCHES Credit header searches are among the most powerful locator tools. These searches return information from credit reports on individuals. They are a valuable source because almost all people have been involved in some credit activity either under their true names or an assumed (or known as) name. It is appropriate to keep in mind that for common names, it may be necessary to use the Social Security number or date of birth to differentiate the subject from other people with the same name. The credit bureau headers offer two search mechanisms. First, the examiner can discover a current address, an address history, and Social Security number(s) associated with the target by using a past address up to seven years old. Second, once the Social Security number is in hand, the headers can be searched for matches, because the Social Security number is a national identity number. Although Social Security numbers are protected from disclosure by the Privacy Act, it has become practically impossible for individuals to avoid disclosing them on public records. |  
80 | Data Analysis 1 | The ___________________ function is used to match data in a transaction file with records in a master file, such as matching invoice data in an accounts receivable file to a master list of vendors. | Join | Compliance verification | Correlation analysis | Date | 3.607 | Investigation | Data Analysis | Record Selection; Joining Files; Multi-File Processing | Joining Files | Joining Files  The Join function gathers together the specified parts of different data files. Joining files combines fields from two sorted input files into a third file. Join is used to match data in a transaction file with records in a master file, such as matching invoice data in an accounts receivable file to a master cluster. For example, you may need to compare two different files to find differing records between files. The following is an example of how joining two files can easily provide that information. |  
81 | Data Analysis 21 | Beta, a fraud examiner, is concerned that employees are abusing their expense accounts and are spending more than the $30 per day allowed for meals. Beta performs a data analysis on all expense reports to locate any meal expenses greater than $30. This type of data analysis function is called _______________________. | Compliance verification | Horizontal analysis | Vertical analysis | Multi-file processing | 3.608 | Investigation | Data Analysis | Correlation Analysis; Verifying Multiples of a Number; Compliance Verification | Compliance Verification | Compliance Verification This function determines whether company policies are met by employee transactions. If a company limits the amount of its reimbursements, the software can check to see that this limit is being observed. Many times fraud examiners can find early indications of fraud by testing detail data for values above or below specified amounts. For example, when employees are out of town, do they adhere to the company policy of not spending more than $30 a day for meals? For starters, we can look at the expense reports and select those with meal expenses exceeding $30. With the in formation returned from this simple query, we have a starting point for suspecting fraud. Even though these variances are small ($2 and $3), the time taken to research small variances can be well invested. The trail might lead to something big. After further investigation, you might learn that the employee did not have supporting documentation to submit because a vendor’s sales representative paid for all the meals. If this is the case, you have two fraud suspects, the employee and the employee’s boss who approved the report. |  
82 | Data Analysis 22 | Which of the following data analysis functions is most useful in testing for hidden journal entries? | Journal entry gap tests | Aging analysis | Statistical sampling | Identifying duplicates | 3.626 | Investigation | Data Analysis | JOURNAL ENTRY GAP TESTS; IDENTIFY NONSTANDARD JOURNAL ENTRIES MADE IN A TIMEFRAME AFTER YEAR; END RELATED TO SPECIFIC ACCOUNTS; SUMMARIZE ACTIVITY BY USER ACCOUNT | JOURNAL ENTRY GAP TESTS | JOURNAL ENTRY GAP TESTS Gaps may signal incomplete data processing or, in the situation of journal entries, possible hidden entries. Usually, a method of documenting these occurrences, along with a review by an independent party, is sufficient to ensure the completeness and accuracy of processing. However, it is rare that a journal entry gap test is performed in the accounting department (it is more common in the accounts payable area related to the check sequence), so this may be the first time this test is being performed. |

All other items are expressed as a percentage of these two numbers. |     
86 | Digital Forensics 22 | When seizing a laptop computer for forensic examination, you should do which of the following first? | Remove the battery | Close the lid | Unplug the computer | Turn off the screen | 3.718 | Investigation | Digital Forensics | SECURE THE EVIDENCE | SECURE THE EVIDENCE | Laptop computers, however, require additional considerations. When seizing a laptop, it is important to remove the battery first and then pull the plug. It is essential when seizing a laptop to recover all of the components that belong to the laptop, such as flash drives, CD-ROMs and DVD–ROMs, and power supplies. Often, laptop computers must be imaged with their drives installed, and because of the proprietary nature of the laptops themselves, they will only function with their own components. Many  times these components can be located in the laptop carrying case. |  
87 | Digital Forensics 35 | Stephen wants to make an exact copy of a particular computer hard drive without disturbing the original data. Which of the following products would be most useful in performing this task? | EnCase | Microsoft Excel | ActiveData | ACL | 3.727 | Investigation | Digital Forensics | Digital Forensics Software; EnCase Forensic; How EnCase Forensic Works; OBTAIN FORENSICALLY SOUND ACQUISITIONS; ADVANCED PRODUCTIVITY FEATURES | EnCase Forensic | EnCase Forensic  EnCase Forensic is a computer forensics software program by Guidance Software.

88 | Digital Forensics 36 | Often, it is necessary to examine printers as well as computers for data because printers may contain internal _____________________ that may contain information relevant to a fraud examination. | Hard drives | Phone connections | Network connections | Cartridges | 3.706 | Investigation | Digital Forensics | Workstation; PRINTERS | PRINTERS | In addition to using printer-spool files to recover previously printed documents, many printers have internal hard drives that may contain information relevant to a fraud examination. In general, any information sent to and stored by a printer is recoverable unless the printer has overwritten the data.  Investigation  Digital Forensics 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.707 Furthermore, some printers have memory buffer — temporary storage area of jobs waiting to be printed — which may also contain important information. Information contained in memory buffer, however, is generally limited to recently created and stored data. |   
89 | Digital Forensics 39 | A megabyte is equal to how many bytes of data? | 1,048,576 | 256 | 1,024 | 1,073,741,824 | 3.718 | Investigation | Digital Forensics | SECURE THE EVIDENCE | SECURE THE EVIDENCE | All data is composed of bits (binary digits). It takes eight bits to make one byte, which is what we are commonly used to hearing when we talk about storage capacity, such as 256 megabytes. One megabyte equals 1024 kilobytes, and one kilobyte equals 1024 bytes. As you can see, one bit is a relatively infinitesimal piece of data, but it is important that not even one bit of data be altered by the forensic process. |  
90 | Illicit Transactions 10 | The federal law passed in 2003 that eliminated the requirement that banks return the physical check to the customer after the check has been negotiated is commonly referred to as which of the following? | Check 21 | The Electronic Check Act | Substitute Check Act | The Copy Check Act | 3.812 | Investigation | Illicit Transactions | CHECK 21 | CHECK 21 | In July 2003, Congress issued final regulations regarding the availability of funds and collection of checks. These regulations, known as “Check 21,” created “substitute checks,” a type of negotiable instrument that became the legal equivalent of paper checks. This provision facilitates the efficient collection and return of checks in electronic form by alleviating the collection requirement that depository banks actually send the original paper checks to collecting banks for payment. |   
91 | Illicit Transactions 11 | The following question is representative of what type of sampling? "If I believe some kind of irregularity might exist in the records, what sample size will I have to audit to have assurance of finding at least one example?" | Discovery sampling | Attribute sampling | Random sampling | Statistical Sampling | 3.831 | Investigation | Illicit Transactions | Statistical Sampling; SAMPLING FOR ATTRIBUTES; DISCOVERY SAMPLING | DISCOVERY SAMPLING | DISCOVERY SAMPLING This is the best type of sampling for auditing for fraud because it is sampling until one occurrence is found. Discovery sampling deals with the probability of discovering at least one error in a given sample size if the population error is a certain percentage. This type of sampling is directed toward a specific objective, such as:  EXAMPLE “If I believe some kind of error or irregularity might exist in the records, what sample size will I have to audit to have assurance of finding at least one example?” |  
92 | Illicit Transactions 24 | The _______________________________ method is used to prove illicit income circumstantially, by showing that a person's assets or expenditures for a given period exceed those that can be accounted for from known or admitted sources of income. | Net worth | Sampling | Benford's | Attribute | 3.833 | Investigation | Illicit Transactions | Net-Worth Methods | Net-Worth Methods | The net-worth method (or comparative net-worth analysis) is used to prove illicit income circumstantially, by showing that a person’s assets or expenditures for a given period exceed that which can be accounted for from known or admitted sources of income. The net-worth method is a reliable method for estimating a person’s ill-gotten gains. The method is used extensively by the Internal Revenue Service, especially in drug and money laundering cases. |   
93 | Illicit Transactions 29 | Fraud examiners frequently review banking records. How long are banks generally required to maintain copies of customers' financial transactions? | Five years | Two years | Four years | Three years | 3.807 | Investigation | Illicit Transactions | Electronic Banking; Retention of Records; Title I—Recordkeeping | Title IRecordkeeping | These regulations provide, in part, that banks must keep an original, microfilm, or other copy or reproduction of most demand deposits (checking account) and savings account records must be retained for five years. The records must include signature cards; statements, ledger cards or other records disclosing all transactions, that is, deposits and withdrawals; and copies of customers’ check s, bank drafts, money orders, and cashier’s checks drawn on the bank or issued and payable by it. |  
94 | Illicit Transactions 39 | What do auditors or fraud examiners look for when sampling for attributes? | Deviation occurrence rate | Convergences | Inclusion | Uniformity | 3.831 | Investigation | Illicit Transactions | Statistical Sampling; SAMPLING FOR ATTRIBUTES; DISCOVERY SAMPLING | SAMPLING FOR ATTRIBUTES | SAMPLING FOR ATTRIBUTES Sampling for attributes is used by auditors or fraud examiners looking for a deviation occurrence rate (deviations, errors, and exceptions  are synonyms). When performing this type of sampling, you are looking for the presence or absence of a defined condition. |

Manipulators are displacement activities that reduce nervousness. | 
96 | Sources of Information 21 | Documents filed to show the dispersal of assets after a subject's death are: | Probate court records | Voter registration records | Utility records | Telephone directory | 3.416 | Investigation | Sources of Information | Criminal Court Records; Probate Court Records | Probate Court Records | Probate Court Records Probate court records are documents filed to show the dispersal of assets after a subject’s death. The probate court conducts an investigation to verify any debts owed by an individual estate and sees to the dispersal of assets according to the deceased’s will (or if there is no will, by state law) after all debts are paid. |  
97 | Sources of Information 38 | If a Certified Fraud Examiner wants to conduct a background investigation of a new vendor to ensure that the company actually exists, which of the following public records would be most useful at the county level in most states? | Fictitious business name/DBA information | Criminal litigation index | Corporate charter | Civil litigation index | 3.422 | Investigation | Sources of Information | Foreign Corporation Registration Records; Fictitious Business Names/Doing Business As Information; Tax Related Filings; State Court Records; State Civil Court Records | Fictitious Business Names/Doing Business As Information | Fictitious Business Names/Doing Business As Information Doing business as (DBA) information is typically filed at the county level, though many states require filing with at the state level as well. Most states also require limited partnerships, trusts, and joint ventures to file DBA information at the state or county level. This information will provide insight into the true business venture behind the name. DBA information is very similar to corporate filings with the secretary of state, and they allow examiners to trace the corporation’s roots or  prove ownership in sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited partnerships, joint ventures, and trusts. |  
98 | Sources of Information 44 | Google is an example of which of the following? | An Internet search engine | A public records service | A data analysis system | A credit reporting bureau | 3.502 | Investigation | Sources of Information | Search Engines; GOOGLE; BING | GOOGLE | GOOGLE  Google is the most-used search engine in the United States and has advanced search capabilities. Individual Web pages are ranked by the engine’s software according to how often the page is linked to by others, determining the page’s “importance” by the number of links and the identity of the linking page. Google is a good source for finding targeted information on a particular topic. Additionally, learning Google-specific search operators will provide the investigator with an extremely powerful tool for online investigations. |  
99 | Sources of Information 45 | Which of the following databases would be the best to consult if one were looking for business and financial news articles? | Factiva | Legal Information Institute | Global Internet News Agency | KnowX | 3.513 | Investigation | Sources of Information | Specific Search Operators; GOOGLE OPERATORS | Factiva | Factiva Factiva, from Dow Jones, is a business information and research tool.

100 | Sources of Information 46 | Symbols and words - such as the plus sign, the minus sign, and the words "and" and "not" that are used to limit or expand an Internet search are referred to as which of the following? | Boolean operators | Limiting factors | Search fields | Expansion numerals | 3.511 | Investigation | Sources of Information | FRIENDFEED; A Guide to Successful Internet Searching; Running Searches; Boolean Operators | Boolean Operators | Boolean Operators The best way to utilize a search engine is to use two, or possibly three, keywords that best describe the topic. If the words succeed one another, as in the case of check fraud,  then it may be beneficial to use Boolean operators to aid one’s search. Boolean operators  are symbols that Accessing Information Online  Investigation 3.512   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  help the search engine to better understand exactly what it is searching for. Putting the “+” symbol between “check+fraud,” for example, will indicate to the search engine that it is to search only for pages that have the word fraud immediately following check.  If you insert the word and,  so that the search reads check and fraud, the search engine will understand to search for websites and pages that contain both the words check  and fraud,  but not necessarily right next to each other.   Some of the more common Boolean operator symbols, or connectors, are shown below. |  
101 | Civil Justice System 15 | In a civil case if the court believes that none of the facts as presented are in dispute and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the court may grant a motion for _________________________. | Summary judgment | Acquittal | Verdict of guilt | Dismissal | 2.612 | Law | Civil Justice System | Motion to Dismiss; Motion to Make More Definite and Certain; Motion in Limine; Motion to Strike; Motion for Continuance; Motion for Summary Judgment; Counterclaims and Cross-Claims | Motion for Summary Judgment | Motion for Summary Judgment A motion for summary judgment asks a judge to decide the case, without a trial, based on the evidence contained in the complaint and answer. Judges may also consider affidavits or declarations (i.e., sworn written statements), contracts, or other materials in reaching their summary decision. Either side in a lawsuit can file for summary judgment. The motion is granted unless it can be shown that some of the facts as presented are in dispute. |   
102 | Civil Justice System 23 | The procedure whereby an impartial third-party assists the parties to a lawsuit to work out a settlement is called ___________________. | Mediation | Binding arbitration | Judicial intervention | Non-binding arbitration | 2.613 | Law | Civil Justice System | Alternative Dispute Resolution; Mediation; Arbitration | Mediation | Mediation Mediation is the process whereby an impartial third-person assists the parties in reaching a resolution of the dispute. The mediator does not decide who should win, but instead works with the parties to reach a mutually agreeable settlement. Any agreement will be enforced as a contract. |  
103 | Civil Justice System 33 | _________________ rules require parties to disclose certain information before formal discovery begins. | Prediscovery disclosure | Oral deposition | Preemptive liability | Plaintiff counterclaim | 2.603 | Law | Civil Justice System | Prediscovery Disclosure; Pre-trial Conferences | Prediscovery Disclosure | Prediscovery Disclosure  FRCP 26(a) and similar state rules require parties to make prediscovery disclosures. These rules require parties to disclose certain information before formal discovery begins, such as the disclosure of witnesses’ identities, materials that may be used to support claims or defenses, computations of damages, and insurance agreements that may cover the claim. As amended in 2006, Rule 26(a) includes electronically stored information (ESI) in the list of items that litigants must provide in their prediscovery disclosures. |  
104 | Civil Justice System 4 | Able sues Baker and Charlie for breach of contract. Baker files a claim against Charlie alleging that Charlie failed to pay Baker money he was owed under the same contract. Baker's claim against Charles is called a: | Cross-claim | Third-party practice | Counterclaim | Joinder of parties | 2.612 | Law | Civil Justice System | Motion to Dismiss; Motion to Make More Definite and Certain; Motion in Limine; Motion to Strike; Motion for Continuance; Motion for Summary Judgment; Counterclaims and Cross-Claims | Counterclaims and Cross-Claims | Prediscovery Disclosure  FRCP 26(a) and similar state rules require parties to make prediscovery disclosures.

105 | Civil Justice System 5 | Lawsuits which involve parties from different states and have more than $75,000 in controversy are known as: | Diversity cases | Intrastate cases | Interdiction cases | Interstate cases | 2.601 | Law | Civil Justice System | THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM; Civil Litigation; Beginning the Civil Action | Civil Litigation | Civil Litigation Civil actions to recover damages for fraud or to enjoin further fraudulent activity can be filed by private plaintiffs in state or federal courts. Most common-law fraud actions, usually styled misrepresentation claims, are filed in state courts. Suits involving parties from different states and involving more than $75,000 in controversy (known as diversity cases), or actions brought on the basis of federal statutes, such as the civil RICO provisions, can be brought in federal court. Federal court generally is preferred by plaintiffs in larger cases because federal courts provide better access to witnesses and documents located in different states. The procedures described below are largely drawn from the federal rules. |  
106 | Civil Justice System 8 | Sworn testimony given by a party upon questioning by counsel before trial and outside of court is referred to as which of the following? | Deposition | Privileged interview | Oath | Subpoena duces tecum | 2.604 | Law | Civil Justice System | Oral Depositions; Interrogatories | Oral Depositions | Oral Depositions Depositions are probably the most popular and useful form of discovery. A deposition is sworn testimony given by a party or witness upon questioning by counsel for one of the parties before trial and outside of court, usually in a lawyer’s office. Opposing counsel and a stenographer, who administers the oath and transcribes the testimony, also are present. Deposition testimony may be used to obtain evidence about the party’s own case or the opponent’s, or to preserve testimony for trial. In the federal system, a witness outside the subpoena power of the court can be deposed in the area he resides and the transcript read to the jury at trial. If the deposing attorney wishes to inspect or refer during the proceedings to certain documents in the witness’s possession, these can be demanded by a subpoena duces tecum, a legal order for the witness to produce the documents for reference during the deposition. | 
107 | Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud 16 | The reading of the indictment or information in open court where the defendant pleads to the charges is called: | The arraignment | The bond hearing | The identity hearing | The pre-trial hearing | 2.508 | Law | Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud | Indictment and Information; Arraignment | Arraignment | The arraignment must take place in open court, and it consists of reading the indictment or information to the defendant and calling on him to enter a plea. The defendant may plead guilty, not guilty, or nolo contendere. If the defendant pleads guilty, the sentencing phase of the criminal justice process begins. A plea of not guilty sets in motion the adjudicative process as described below. A plea of nolo contendere means the defendant does not contest the charges, without formally admitting or denying them. A defendant may plead nolo only with the consent of the court. If accepted, a nolo plea is the same as a plea of guilty for purposes of punishment, but it cannot be used as a formal admission of guilt. This makes it a favored plea for corporate defendants facing subsequent civil litigation. |

The jury is expected to be impartial. For the jury selection process, called voir dire, the prospective jurors are brought into the courtroom, and they are questioned by the parties or the court to determine their suitability. Jurors are asked about their background, employment, general beliefs and principles, knowledge of the actual case or cases like it, whether they know any of the parties in the case or their attorneys—virtually anything that might elucidate the potential juror’s state of mind is fair game. (Provided, of course, the material is relevant to the case; outright character assassination is not part of jury selection, though some jurors have felt otherwise, especially in high-publicity trials.) |

119 | Evidence 8 | A Certified Fraud Examiner stated that $10,000 was stolen from the plaintiff's business and that two days later, $10,000 was deposited into an account owned by the defendant. This is an example of what type of admissible evidence? | Circumstantial evidence | Character evidence | Demonstrative evidence | Direct evidence | 2.702 | Law | Evidence | Direct Versus Circumstantial Evidence | Direct Versus Circumstantial Evidence | Direct Versus Circumstantial Evidence There are two basic types of admissible evidence:  direct evidence and circumstantial evidence. Direct evidence includes testimony that tends to prove or disprove a fact in issue directly, such as eyewitness testimony or a confession. Circumstantial evidence is evidence that tends to prove or disprove facts in issue indirectly, by inference. Many fraud cases are proved entirely by circumstantial evidence, or by a combination of circumstantial and direct evidence, but seldom by direct evidence alone. The most difficult element to prove in many fraud cases —fraudulent intent — is usually proved circumstantially, and necessarily so, because direct proof of the defendant’s state of mind, absent a confession or the testimony of a co-conspirator, is impossible. |

This piece of legislation is known as _______________________. | Sarbanes-Oxley Act | HIPAA | Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act | USA PATRIOT Act | 2.214 | Law | Law Related to Fraud | Federal Legislation Related to Fraud; The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Public Law 107-204); Public Company Accounting Oversight Board | The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Public Law 107-204) | The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Public Law 107-204) On July 30, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This law, which was triggered in large part by several corporate accounting scandals that occurred in 2001 and 2002, significantly changed the laws of corporate governance and the rules and regulations under which accounting firms must operate. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was designed to restore investor confidence in capital markets and help eliminate financial statement fraud in publicly traded companies while at the same time significantly increasing the penalties for corporate accounting fraud. The most significant changes brought on by the Act included:  • The creation of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board • Requirements for senior financial officers to certify SEC filings • New standards for audit committee independence • New standards for auditor independence • Enhanced financial disclosure requirements • New protections for corporate whistleblowers • Enhanced penalties for white-collar crime |

134 | Overview of the Legal System 1 | Questions of law in U.S. criminal courts generally are decided by: | The judge | The attorneys | Juries | The judge and jury | 2.109 | Law | Overview of the Legal System |  A TYPICAL STATE JUDICIAL SYSTEM | A TYPICAL STATE JUDICIAL SYSTEM | Domestic Relations Courts Criminal  Courts (Maximum amounts vary, depending on the state, from $200 to about $5,000) (Serious criminal cases tend to be handled by the jurisdiction trial courts) Law  Overview of the United States Legal System 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.109 In general, the judge and jury serve important roles during a trial. In the trial setting, the jury finds the facts, and the judge applies the law, rules on evidence, and generally moderates the proceeding to ensure a fair trial. If, however, a jury is waived by the defendant and government, the judge decides both the facts and the law. |   
135 | Overview of the Legal System 13 | An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is accomplished by applying for a: | Writ of Certiorari | Writ of Appeals | Writ of Civitatem | Writ of Nisi Juratis | 2.110 | Law | Overview of the Legal System | Civil and Criminal Actions for Fraud; Criminal Versus Civil Actions for Fraud | A TYPICAL STATE JUDICIAL SYSTEM | In the federal system, an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is accomplished by applying for a Writ of Certiorari. Relatively few appeals — “writs” — are granted. The Supreme Court usually hears only those cases that present an important question of constitutional law, or may be used to resolve a “split” or disagreement on a point of law among the circuits, or that have considerable significance to the judicial system beyond the interest of the litigants. If the Supreme Court “denies Cert.,” the lower court decision stands and the appeal process ends unless the defendant can find some collateral ground, such as alleged constitutional errors in state court proceedings, to attack the judgment. As death penalty challenges illustrate, appeals on such points, often brought by people in custody under “Habeas Corpus” proceedings, can sometimes consume a decade or more. |

137 | Overview of the Legal System 16 | Which Amendment to the U.S. Constitution covers the right to counsel? | Sixth Amendment | Fourth Amendment | Fourteenth Amendment | Fifth Amendment | 2.101 | Law | Overview of the Legal System | Law; OVERVIEW OF THE UNITED STATES LEGAL SYSTEM; Basic Concepts of the Law; Constitutional Law; Substantive and Procedural Law | Constitutional Law | Constitutional rights that are of particular importance to Certified Fraud Examiners include those found in the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The Fourth Amendment guarantees the right of all citizens to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. This means that the government may not seize any records in a criminal case unless reasonable grounds exist — “probable cause” — to believe that the records would constitute evidence of a crime, and that a suspect may not be arrested unless there is probable cause to believe that he committed an offense. The Fifth Amendment guarantees subjects of a criminal investigation the right to refuse to answer questions or to provide certain personal information that might be incriminating. The Sixth Amendment affords subjects in a criminal investigation the right to counsel, the right to confront (cross-examine) the witnesses against them, and the right to a speedy trial. |   
138 | Overview of the Legal System 20 | _______________________ is comprised of the basic laws of rights and duties. When people refer to something that is "against the law," they are usually referring to this type of law. | Substantive law | Statutory law | Common law | Procedural law | 2.101 | Law | Overview of the Legal System | Law; OVERVIEW OF THE UNITED STATES LEGAL SYSTEM; Basic Concepts of the Law; Constitutional Law; Substantive and Procedural Law | Substantive and Procedural Law | Substantive and Procedural Law Additionally, in the United States, there are two main categories of law: substantive law and procedural law. Substantive law is comprised of the basic laws of rights and duties (contract law, tort law, criminal law, etc.) as opposed to procedural law, which involves rules governing pleadings, evidence, jurisdiction, and so on. If someone says an act is “against the law,” he means substantive law, which includes statutes and ordinances at every level; common law, or Overview of the United States Legal System Law 2.102  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  case law, from all the various courts; and state and federal constitutions. |   
139 | Testifying as an Expert Witness 17 | In cross-examination of an expert witness, the opposing counsel often will use the "Is it not true?" and "Would you agree with me?" approach. This technique of cross examination is called: | Sounding board | Contradictory approach | Hypothetical questions | Opposing sides theory | 2.824 | Law | Testifying as an Expert Witness | Bias; Confrontation; Sounding Board; Fees; Terms of Engagement | Sounding Board | Sounding Board This method uses the witness as a sounding board to reacquaint the jury with the favorable aspects (to opposing counsel) of the case. This technique often uses the “is it not true?” and “would you agree with me?” approach. Constant agreement is useful to browbeat the expert. In the eyes of the judge and jury, agreement with various questions raised by the opposing counsel also might be assumed to be a general concurrence with the position of the opposing counsel. 
140 | Testifying as an Expert Witness 29 | Able, a Certified Fraud Examiner, has just finished testifying on direct examination. During cross-examination, the opposing counsel tries to imply that Able has examined only one area of the case and that his investigation was limited in extent or scope. The technique that the opposing counsel is using is called: | Myopic vision | Sounding board | Contradiction | Voir dire | 2.822 | Law | Testifying as an Expert Witness | Myopic Vision | Myopic Vision | Myopic Vision Myopic vision entails getting the expert to admit to a great amount of time being spent in the investigation of a matter, then selecting an area to highlight about which the expert is unsure or has not done much work. This area might not be central to the issues in the case, but it must be relevant to the conclusions reached. Then the opposing counsel will make a large issue of it and prove that the expert’s vision is myopic in that the work was limited in extent or scope and, as such, substandard. At the same time, the matter of fees could be drawn in to show that large sums were expended to have this “obviously incomplete” work done. |
