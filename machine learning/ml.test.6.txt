Some recipients spend their money less conspicuously by paying off debts or paying down mortgages.  • The Gift Taker — An official or executive who regularly accepts inappropriate gifts is often one susceptible to larger payments. • The Odd Couple” — Corrupt payers and recipients often  appear to have very friendly social relationships. Frequent outside contacts, particularly between parties who do not appear to have much in common, might be a sign of deeper and more troublesome ties between the parties. • The Rule Breaker — This is often the most significant characteristic. A person taking payoffs will often take action on his own, or direct a subordinate to bend, break, or ignore standard operating procedures or rules to benefit the payer. Particular attention should be directed toward those who insert themselves into areas in which they are normally not involved or attempt to assert authority or make decisions for which they are not responsible. • The Complainer — A corrupt recipient often makes excuses for deficiencies in the payer’s services, such as poor quality, late deliveries, or high prices. Look for higher prices, Financial Transactions  Bribery and Corruption 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.717 extra” payments, or commissions approved by the suspect, because these might be the source of kickback fraud. • Genuine Need — Greed, rather than need, seems to be the motivating factor in most cases. Occasionally, however, legitimate pressures, such as illness of family members or drug addiction, can induce participation in an illegal scheme.|0.0448776728514074

The Financial Profile will identify most illicit funds deposited to accounts or expended in significant amounts. It will not reveal relatively small currency transactions, particularly if they were for concealed activities, consumables, or unusual one-time expenses, such as medical bills. The Financial Profile might give inaccurate or false negative readings unless such activities are identified. This is done through preparation of the Behavioral Profile.

The most important of the above information (and often the only information needed) is the bank account information. Begin by examining the checks, check register, and/or the cash disbursement journal and paying particular attention to the following: • Payables and expenses charged to the account (cust omer) on which the illicit payments were made — If the examiner suspects that kickbacks were paid on sales to the ABC Corporation, for example, look at the payables and expenses charged to that account/customer. • Payments for services — Check payments for services such as sales commissions or consulting fees, which do not require the delivery of goods and need relatively little documentation to obtain payment. • Anomalous charges — For the business, an example of anomalous payments can be those for design fees paid by a company that is engaged in business that normally would not require such services.  • The endorsement on the check — This might be by signature, or more commonly, by a stamp in the name of the business payee. Note the identity of the endorser. (Some corrupt Bribery and Corruption  Financial Transactions   1.724                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  recipients have been known to endorse such checks in their own name.) • The location where the check was negotiated —If not obvious from the endorsement, identify the bank where the deposit was made by checking the depository bank’s stamp on the back of the check. The geographical location of the depository bank is an important lead that can connect the check to the suspected recipient. Determining the depository bank’s identity is critical to obtaining the recipient’s bank account information. • Checks with a second endorsement — A typical indication of a phony payable check is one paid to, and endorsed by, a business, which is then endorsed by an individual, thereby permitting it to be cashed or deposited in a personal account. In similar fashion, a check payable to a third party can be signed over to the issuer of the check. • Cashed (not deposited) checks payable to a business — Generally, a For Deposit Only” stamp appears on the back of deposited checks, although this is not always the case. Most banks have a code stamp that indicates whether the check was cashed or not. These codes vary, and can be obtained from the bank where the check was negotiated. • Checks that fall into an unexplained pattern — An example of a suspicious payable scheme is one where checks are drawn once a month in an amount equal to some percentage of the sales against which they are charged, and are not otherwise explained. Such a pattern might indicate a kickback scheme. If an examination of the checks themselves does not yield any clear leads, compare the various records of payment with the backup documentation. Note particularly the following circumstances: • The absence of documentation — The absence of documentation to support a particular payment can include: ? No invoice appearing in the files for a payment to a supplier or contractor. ? No receipt to indicate that materials paid for were delivered. ? No consultant’s work product to substantiate consulting fees paid. • Discrepancies — Discrepancies between payment information and backup documentation can include: ? A check payable to a supplier in an amount different than his invoice. ? A check payable to a person or entity different than that identified on the invoice. • Anomalies in support documents — Anomalies in the backup documentation can include invoices from several suppliers in different names that: ? Have the same business address. ? Are signed by the same person. ? Returned to a post office box.  • Unnumbered or sequentially numbered invoices — An example of an invoice scam uses invoices numbered 101, 102, and 103, which are dated 30 days apart. Of course, it is highly Financial Transactions  Bribery and Corruption 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.725 unlikely that a legitimate business would refrain from issuing invoices in the interim. • Alterations — Copies of originals can be made for concealing alterations of original documents. Examples can include alterations or photocopies of backup papers.  • Location and other information on the invoices that tie it to the suspected recipient — If the above steps still do not yield any suspect payments, return to the check registers and cash disbursement journals to look for discrepancies between the entries and the checks or backup documentation, or their absence. The register and journals might also indicate the purpose of payments made by wire, cashier’s check, or cash.|0.0171943783779411

However, there are statutes prohibiting bribery of employees of financial institutions to influence a loan.

Also look for a correlation between cash-generating transactions and money wires or courier services, which are sometimes used to send cash. • If the scheme is ongoing, consider the use of visual or electronic surveillance (if you’re a member of law enforcement), or try to introduce an undercover agent or implement a sting operation. • Unexplained or unusual cash disbursements or withdrawals, particularly from a business that does not normally deal in cash, might itself indicate illicit transactions, or corroborate such testimony.

Note where the check was deposited, and the account number, if available. If the check is not endorsed, the bank will still be able to locate the account to which it was deposited through its own internal records.  • Obtain the records of the account where the check was deposited. The signature card and the monthly account statement will show the nominal account holder. In the case of business accounts, the bank should also have a copy of the corporate resolution or partnership agreement authorizing the account. • If the identity of the individual recipient is still not clear, check the public filings required of business entities to determine ownership. Corporate documents (articles of incorporation, annual reports, and some other basic documents) and limited partnerships might also be filed in some jurisdictions at the county level. The fictitious name index, business license files, telephone billing records, and even utility billing records can also lead to the identity of the principals.  • If the original check is missing or has been destroyed, a microfilm copy can be obtained from the bank on which the check was drawn. (The bank where the check was deposited will also have a microfilm copy of the check. Unless the exact date of deposit and the identity of the depository bank are known, it will be very difficult to locate it.) • Payments by wire transfer or cashier’s check  can be traced to the recipient. A wire transfer from an account appears on that account statement as a debit memo (often Bribery and Corruption  Financial Transactions   1.726                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  abbreviated as DM ). The Wire Transfer Request should show the name of the purchaser, the payee, and the bank and account number to which the funds were transferred. The sender receives a copy of this request, and the bank also maintains a copy, which is usually filed by date. • The bank’s retained copy of a cashier’s check will identify the payee. The bank also keeps the negotiated check when it is returned for payment. It will contain the endorsement and show where it was negotiated. Banks usually file cashier’s checks by number, making it necessary to know the approximate date they were issued to link them to the purchasers. Look for a cashier’s check or wire transfer on the dates of suspect cash withdrawals, checks to cash, or checks to the issuing bank. Remember that such instruments can be purchased for cash from any bank, not only from the bank where the payer’s account is located. • If the trail described above leads to an intermediary, the entire process must be repeated.|3.99701627650195e-05

By using a toll-free 800 number that then links the caller to the per-minute charges, promoters are able to surreptitiously begin charging customers for calls. 800 numbers are often used as a front in telemarketing operations to lead consumers to think that a call is free, when in fact there are hidden charges everywhere. A particularly vicious combination uses a toll-free number to make a presentation about communication services.

Victims dial in, thinking they will receive information on claiming funds from abandoned bank accounts or inheritances from long lost relatives. Credit repair offers and advance-fee loan services use 900 numbers extensively.

Long-term construction contracts, for example, use either the completed-contract method or the percentage-of-completion method, depending partly on the circumstances. The completed-contract method does not record revenue until the project is 100 percent complete. Construction costs are held in an inventory account until completion of the project. The percentage-of-completion method recognizes revenues and expenses as measurable progress on a project is made, but this method is particularly vulnerable to manipulation. Managers can often easily manipulate the percentage-of-completion and the estimated costs to complete a construction project in order to recognize revenues prematurely and conceal contract overruns.|0.102610450860805

In July 2006, the GAO issued an update to its 2002 report, Financial Statement Restatements: Trends, Market Impacts, Regulatory Responses, and Remaining Challenges. The original report was based on the GAO’s analysis of 689 of 919 financial statement restatements occurring from January 1, 1997 through June 30, 2002. To update the information in the original, the GAO undertook a similar analysis of 1,390 public company restatements that occurred between January 1, 2002 and September 30, 2005. The following are some of the findings of the two studies:  • The percentage of publicly traded companies announcing restatements increased from less than one percent in 1997 to over three percent by the end of 2002. This percentage rose again, to 6.8 percent, by September of 2005.  • The quantity of restatements resulting from accounting irregularities grew from 92 in 1997 to 314 in 2002, or approximately 241 percent. In the first 9 months of 2005 (through September 30), there were 523 restatements announced, which amounted to an increase of approximately 67 percent from 2002 and more than 468 percent from 1997.  Financial Statement Fraud  Financial Transactions   1.308                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  • The average size of a company restating its financial statements increased from $500 million in 1997 to $2 billion in 2002. By September 30, 2005, the average market capitalization of a company announcing a restatement had grown to $6 billion. • Cost and expense issues were the most common reason for restatements between July 2002 and September 2005. These restatements, which include over- or understating costs or expenses, improper classification of costs, and other misreporting of costs, accounted for over 35 percent of restatements examined during that period. In the 2002 study, cost and expense issues were the second most common reason for restatement, comprising 16 percent of all restatements.  • Twenty percent of the restatements analyzed in the 2006 study were due to revenue recognition issues, making this the second most common reason for restatement during the period studied. This represents a decline from the 2002 study in which revenue recognition was the most common reason for restatement, comprising 38 percent of the population.

In some cases, illegal funds are spent on personal assets, such as homes, cars, jewelry, and furniture. But the typical money launderer will not dispose of all his illegal currency in this manner; he will want to have a certain amount of liquid reserves for spending. Keeping large bundles of cash is inefficient because they are difficult to hide and transport. Therefore, money launderers will often convert substantial portions of their currency into negotiable instruments such as cashier’s checks and money orders, which are routinely issued by financial institutions. Criminals prefer these negotiable instruments for two reasons. First, cashier’s checks and money orders are bearer instruments, and the holder can use them or deposit them without having to prove the Financial Transactions  Money Laundering 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1603 source of the funds.

The owner must prove his innocence by a preponderance of the evidence. • Authorizes a claimant to petition the court to determine whether a forfeiture was constitutionally excessive. Directs the court to compare the forfeiture to the gravity of the offense. Places upon the claimant the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence at a hearing conducted by the court without a jury, that the forfeiture is grossly disproportional to the offense upon the claimant.  • Amends the Federal Tort Claims Act to allow claimants to sue the government for any Financial Transactions  Money Laundering 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1637 damage or loss of property while in possession of the government. • Authorizes the use of forfeited property to pay restitution to any victim of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture, including, in the case of a money laundering offense, any offense constituting the underlying specified activity.  • Directs that all civil forfeitures of real property and interests in real property proceed as judicial forfeitures. Prohibits (with exceptions) (1) real property that is the subject of a civil forfeiture from being seized before entry of a forfeiture order; and (2) the owners or occupants of the real property from being evicted from, or otherwise deprived of the use and enjoyment of, real property that is the subject of a pending forfeiture action.  • Provides for the forfeiture of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity” under the money laundering statutes.|0.0318103023399034

General Instructions Who Must File.  Each financial institution (other than a casino, which instead must file FinCEN Form 103, and the U.S. Postal Service for which there are separate rules) must file FinCEN Form 104 (formerly 4789) (CTR) for each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency, or other payment or transfer, by, through, or to the financial institution which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000.  Multiple transactions must be treated as a single transaction if the financial institution has knowledge that (1) they are by or on behalf of the same person, and (2) they result in either currency received (Cash In) or currency disbursed (Cash Out) by the financial institution totaling more than $10,000 during any one business day.  For a bank, a business day is the day on which transactions are routinely posted to customers’ accounts, as normally communicated to depository customers.  For all other financial institutions, a business day is a calendar day. Generally, financial institutions are defined as banks, other types of depository institutions, brokers or dealers in securities, money transmitters, currency exchangers, check cashers, and issuers and sellers of money orders and traveler’s checks.  Should you have questions, see the definitions in 31 CFR Part 103. When and Where To File.

However, all covert operations have similar general objectives: • To obtain evidence of a past, current, or future crime. This evidence usually bears on the culpability of individuals. If an operative in a covert investigation is posing as a thief, for example, actual thieves might confess their involvement to him, unaware that their conversations were being recorded. • To identify those engaged in possible illegal activity. If, for example, cash is missing, a covert investigation or surveillance might disclose who is committing the offense. Thereafter, the covert operation might be discontinued, and the evidence gathered by more traditional means.  • To recover illegal gains. If an accounts payable clerk has been stealing to purchase an automobile, locating the car might permit civil litigation to recover it.  • To identify co-conspirators. If an employee is in collusion with another employee, a covert operation might lead to the identity of the second individual.                                                   1 O’Connell, E. Paul.

Without the examiner’s k nowledge or consent, the informant plants a tape recorder in the break room at the warehouse, and records conversations to which he is not a party. This is a violation of the law regarding interception of communication. Although the recording was made without the examiner’s knowledge or consent, the case is nonetheless compromised.

If a company limits the amount of its reimbursements, the software can check to see that this limit is being observed. Many times fraud exam iners can find early indications of fraud by testing detail data for values above or below specified amounts. For example, when employees are out of town, do they adhere to the company policy of not spending more than $30 a day for meals? For starters, we can look at the expense reports and select those with meal expenses exceeding $30. With the in formation returned from this simple query, we have a starting point for suspecting fraud. Even though these variances are small ($2 and $3), the time taken to research small variances can be well invested. The trail might lead to something big. After further investigation, you might learn that the employee did not have supporting documentation to submit because a vendor’s sales representative paid for all the meals. If this is the case, you have two fraud suspects, the employee and the employee’s boss who approved the report.|0.00296508785907874

There is always a concern when the examiner moves data from one venue to another. One of the concerns is data validity. Is the data valid and pertinent to the investigation? The second concern is integrity. Is the valid data that was selected correct? A simple check or au dit of the validity and integrity of the data should be the first step in the data analysis.    • Consider data format and structure. This consideration is important when the examiner wishes to import or export data with his computer. A date can be formatted into a number of different styles, such as mm/dd/yyyy. The structure of the data will also be important along with the extension. A text file will have a .txt extension associated with it. What format is the current data in? What format will the computer require? How does the examiner get the data from here to there if the data formats and structures are different? • Count the zeros. The examiner should perform a preliminary analysis to ensure that the key strategic issue he is about to develop is worth the effort before initiating his fraud investigation. Data Analysis and Reporting Tools  Investigation 3.614   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  • Consider the spectrum of distinct levels of aggregation at which fraud monitoring is required. Determine the lowest level (transaction level), the highest level (multiparty criminal conspiracies), and the intervening layers that may be present in your industry and respective data. • Begin with the end in mind. In his book, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen Covey states that beginning with the end in mind is good habit. When you develop your fraud intelligence action plan, be certain to consider the end result. One question to ask may be, Will this algorithm/consultant hold up under the intense scrutiny of a court of law?”|0.00215644474223244

There is always a concern when the examiner moves data from one venue to another. One of the concerns is data validity. Is the data valid and pertinent to the investigation? The second concern is integrity. Is the valid data that was selected correct? A simple check or au dit of the validity and integrity of the data should be the first step in the data analysis.    • Consider data format and structure. This consideration is important when the examiner wishes to import or export data with his computer. A date can be formatted into a number of different styles, such as mm/dd/yyyy. The structure of the data will also be important along with the extension. A text file will have a .txt extension associated with it. What format is the current data in? What format will the computer require? How does the examiner get the data from here to there if the data formats and structures are different? • Count the zeros. The examiner should perform a preliminary analysis to ensure that the key strategic issue he is about to develop is worth the effort before initiating his fraud investigation. Data Analysis and Reporting Tools  Investigation 3.614   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  • Consider the spectrum of distinct levels of aggregation at which fraud monitoring is required. Determine the lowest level (transaction level), the highest level (multiparty criminal conspiracies), and the intervening layers that may be present in your industry and respective data. • Begin with the end in mind. In his book, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen Covey states that beginning with the end in mind is good habit. When you develop your fraud intelligence action plan, be certain to consider the end result. One question to ask may be, Will this algorithm/consultant hold up under the intense scrutiny of a court of law?”|0.000166881990847896

First, data analysis software allows the fraud examiner to centralize an investigation, relying less on others to gather pertinent information. Because of the amount of information data mining software is able to sort through, the examiner no longer has to rely on different sources for information. In the past, when analyzing a company’s books for possible discrepancies, the examiner would have to ask for the assistance of several persons within the accounting department to locate the pertinent information.

In the past, an audit or fraud examination could only be complete to the extent that the investigator was able to sift through information. When looking at one month’s worth of a company’s transactions, a fraud examiner might be forced to research more than one million transactions. Given the amount of time an auditor generally has to conduct a single examination, the depth of a manual audit can be suspect at best. By using a data analysis program, the fraud examiner can run several different analysis patterns in a matter of hours, enabling him to look at greater volumes of information from a number of different angles.

Also, if a comp uter is on, an investigator will not want it to go through its normal shutdown routines because Windows is very good about cleaning up after itself. A number of temporary files will be deleted and possibly overwritten during a normal shutdown, and some of these files may be important to the investigation. In most cases, the investigator should simply unplug a running computer. Once the investigator takes possession of the computer he should not allow anyone access it, with the exception of a trained forensic examiner. Digital Forensics  Investigation 3.718   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  There are other reasons to conduct the seizure in this way. By preserving the state of the system at the time of seizure one can help to defeat an argument by opposing counsel that exculpatory information was somehow tainted or erased due to mishandling of the system.

McDonald, the court dealt with the question of whether there was a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding personally purchased items that were used to store work- related materials in the government workplace. In this case, a local detective received an anonymous tip from one of Gossmeyer’s coworkers that Gossmeyer was storing illegal pornographic material in a storage container that was purchased at Gossmeyer’s own expense. The local detective relayed the information to Gossmeyer’s supervisor who proceeded to search Gossmeyer’s workplace, including the storage cabinet. The supervisor found evidence to substantiate the allegation but no charges were ever filed. Gossmeyer filed a lawsuit alleging that her Fourth Amendment rights had been violated by the search of her personal property. The court disagreed, stating that the cabinet was not merely an item of personal property such as a purse or briefcase brought into the workplace, but that it was being used to house work-related materials and therefore, the cabinet was a part of the workplace and not a part of her personal domain.|0.00792364089491146

In the case of United States v. Simons,  the defendant, Simons, was found to have visited several illicit websites that were prohibited by agency policy. The policy specifically prohibited access to unlawful material and further prohibited any personal use of the agency’s Internet. A remote audit of the hard drive on Simons’s government-owned computer revealed that the computer contained several illegal images. In Simons’s challenge of the search under the Fourth Amendment, he claimed that his rights were violated when the hard drive was searched remotely. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held that Simons had no legitimate expectation of privacy because of the agency’s Internet use policy.

To answer that question, one must look at whether there was a prior notice that diminishes the expectation. One can also look at the policy practices of the agency. Having a policy and only selectively enforcing it tends to diminish the policy to the point that it may not negate the privacy expectation. One must also look to the openness and accessibility of the workplace to other Digital Forensics  Investigation 3.712   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  employees. Finally, was there a written waiver of the employee’s expectati on of privacy? If an expectation of privacy does not exist, then the Fourth Amendment will not apply. If it is determined that an expectation of privacy does exist, then what is the purpose behind the search? Is it a work-related search, such as looking for a missing file, or is it due to an allegation of misconduct? If it is a work-related  search, the search must be justified based on the overall circumstances; it must be justified in its inception and permissible in scope. If the search under these conditions is solely for the purpose of a criminal investigation, then a probable cause warrant will generally be necessary in addition to the employee consent.|0.0122658025438881

With loan records, the collateral that secures them, and the results of (bank) credit investigations, a bank has a wealth of information. When a bank makes a commercial loan to an individual, it requires detailed statements of assets and liabilities from the borrower. The loan file also might include the results of credit inquiries regarding paying habits, loan amounts, and present unpaid balances. A bank credit department generally maintains the following basic records: • The credit or loan file: This file includes the loan application, financial statement, and general economic history of the customer.

Check number : This field should contain the number of the financial instrument written on or deposited to the account. The following items, however, will not contain a check number: wire transaction, automated teller machine transaction, point-of-sale transaction, and debit memo. A deposited amount would include a check number unless the deposit was cash, an incoming wire, or a credit memo. 2. Entity from : This field should contain the name of the company or person the check is from—the owner of the account on which the check is written.  3. Bank from : This field should contain the name of the bank from which the check, debit memo, or wire transfer was issued. If desired, the ABA bank number can also be entered to identify the bank’s source of the funds. 4. Date written : This field should contain the date the check was written, the transaction (e.g., wire transfer or debit memo) was generated, or the withdrawal was made. This is Investigation  Tracing Illicit Transactions 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.827 not the date shown on the bank statement; bank statements show the clearing dates— the dates that checks clear the bank. The clearing date can be used if no other dates are present (e.g., if there is no check copy provided by the bank, but the check is listed on the statement). 5. Payee : This field should contain the name of the payee—the person or entity to whom the check was written.  6. Amount written : This field should contain the amount written on the face of the check. If there is a discrepancy between the numerical and written amounts,  the bank will usually honor the written amount. Check the amount the bank has imprinted on the bottom right-hand side of the check in magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) to determine which amount the bank used. 7. Deposited amount : This field should contain the amount of money credited to the bank account by a cash or check deposit, wire transfer, or credit memo. This amount is put into a field separate from the amount written for ease of separating, sorting, and adding the amounts. 8. Memo : This field should contain any notation written on the Memo” line or box on the check. 9. Signatory : This field should contain the name of the person (or persons) who signed the check as the authorized signatory. When entering the data into this field, initials are sufficient if the person referenced is clear. 10. Account number from : This field should contain the account number on which the check, debit memo, or wire transfer was written. 11. Transaction type : This field should contain the type of transaction (e.g., check, transfer, wire, debit memo, credit memo, deposit, ATM deposit or withdrawal, or ATM purchase).  12. First endorser : This field should contain the name of  the first endorser. The first endorser is the person or persons who endorsed the check (i.e., signed the check on the back as the endorser). On checks made out to a company,  the back of the check may be stamped with the company name, bank, and account number and no endorsing signature should be shown.  13. Transaction bank : This field should contain the name of the bank the item was deposited to (or where the check was cashed). This could be the bank from which records have been subpoenaed, the bank stamped on the back of the check, or the bank at which the check was cashed. If the check was negotiated at a non-bank financial institution (e.g., check cashing agency, money transmitter, or casino), the name of that company can be placed here with other specifics entered in the comments” field. 14. Deposited to account : This field should contain the account number to which the check was deposited. It should be noted that some banks write the account number on the back of Tracing Illicit Transactions  Investigation 3.828   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  checks when cashed; this serves as an identifier for the check casher. Therefore, a bank account number located on the back of a check may not mean that the check was deposited into that account. Remember to check the front of the check for a cashed” stamp. 15. Date of transaction : This field should contain the date the check was deposited or negotiated. 16. Comments : The comments field is used for other comments about the transaction. NSF could be entered into the comments field to signify that there were non-sufficient funds to cover the check. Additional information about the endorser (e.g., driver’s license or alien registration number), the name of a secondary endorser, or notes written on the back of the check by the teller could also be placed in the comments field.  1 7.

In general, the question is about the chances for obtaining a guilty verdict, but it is also about the cost and demands of achieving that verdict. According to federal statistics, about 84 percent of the people arrested are prosecuted; 62 percent of these are convicted, and 34 percent are incarcerated.

A prosecutor’s office might decide, for example, that securities frauds of less than $500,000 will not be brought to trial. Because of the immense effort required to prosecute many fraudulent acts, prosecutors have to weigh the cost and exertion of going to court versus the amount available for recovery. Accordingly, many businesses are turning to civil actions to redress fraud. As the criminal courts become more and more jammed, companies can often speed up the process by filing their own civil action.

According to federal statistics, about 84 percent of the people arrested are prosecuted; 62 percent of these are convicted, and 34 percent are incarcerated.

Thus, to determine if a workplace search will violate an employee’s Fourth Amendment rights, an employer must first determine if the employee has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area to be searched. There is no bright-line rule for determining whether an employee has a reasonable privacy expectation in a particular area. Such a privacy interest can exist for a desk drawer, a file cabinet, a locker, or even an entire office, depending on the circumstances. The issue is whether a reasonable person would expect the area to be free from intrusion. The employee does not have to have an ownership interest in the area to have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area.

These facts indicate that the employee has exclusive control over the contents of the file cabinet, and thus has a reasonable expectation of privacy in its contents. In other words, based on the circumstances, the employee would be justified in believing that others cannot and will not enter the file cabinet without his consent. The employee in this scenario has a constitutionally protected privacy interest in the contents of the file cabinet.
