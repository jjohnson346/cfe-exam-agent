18 | Financial Institution Fraud 27 | B.J., a Certified Fraud Examiner, is evaluating a portfolio of loans for his client, ABC Bank. ABC Bank recently acquired a new portfolio of consumer loans. B.J. notices that the loan package was sold without recourse to the broker, the brokerage fee was high relative to other purchases, and the broker is no longer in business. This particular loan portfolio is experiencing a higher than normal default rate.

23 | Financial Statement Fraud 2 | Vertical analysis is a technique for analyzing the relationships between items on an income statement or balance sheet by expressing all components as percentages. When using vertical analysis of an income statement, which of the following components is assigned 100 percent? | Net sales | Total assets | Gross sales | Net assets | 1.335 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Financial Statement Fraud | Financial Statement Analysis; Percentage Analysis — Horizontal and Vertical | Percentage Analysis — Horizontal and Vertical | Percentage Analysis — Horizontal and Vertical  There are traditionally two methods of percentage analysis of financial statements. Vertical analysis  is a technique for analyzing the relationships between the items on an income statement, balance sheet, or statement of cash flows by expressing components as percentages. This method is often referred to as “common sizing” financial statements. In the vertical analysis of an income statement, net sales is assigned 100 percent. For a balance sheet, total assets is assigned 100 percent on the asset side, and total liabilities and equity is expressed as 100 percent. All other items in each of the sections are expressed as a percentage of these numbers. |

Which of the following is a technique for analyzing the percentage change in individual income statement or balance sheet items from one year to the next? | Horizontal analysis | Ratio analysis | Vertical analysis | Statistical sampling | 1.335 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Financial Statement Fraud | Financial Statement Analysis; Percentage Analysis — Horizontal and Vertical | Percentage Analysis — Horizontal and Vertical | Horizontal analysis  is a technique for analyzing the percentage change in individual financial statement items from one period to the next. The first period in the analysis is considered the base period, and the changes in the subsequent period are computed as a percentage of the base period. If more than two periods are presented, each period’s changes are computed as a percentage of the preceding period. As is the case with vertical analysis, this technique will not work for small, immaterial frauds. |  
25 | Health Care Fraud 22 | Falsified prescriptions, excessive supplies, milk supplement scams, lymphedema pumps, and scooter scams are forms of fraud commonly involving what type of health care entity? | Durable medical equipment suppliers | Out-patient services groups | Workers' compensation carriers | Hospitals | 1.1217 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Health Care Fraud | Durable Medical Equipment Suppliers; Home Health Companies; Pharmacy | Durable Medical Equipment Suppliers | Durable Medical Equipment Suppliers Fraud schemes perpetrated by suppliers of durable medical equipment frequently involve: • Falsified prescriptions. • Excessive supplies. • Equipment not delivered or billed before delivery. • Billing for equipment rental after equipment was returned. • Noncovered supplies,(for example, incontinent care kits). • Milk supplement scam. • Lymphedema pumps. • Scooter scam. | 
26 | Health Care Fraud 39 | Billing for a higher level of medical service than was actually rendered is called which of the following? | Upcoding | Global service period violation | Fragmenting | Uplinking | 1.1227 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Health Care Fraud | Global Service Period Violations; Upcoding; Misuse of New Patient Codes; Insured Fraud; Doctor/ER Shopping | Upcoding | Upcoding Upcoding is billing for a higher level of service than was rendered.

The vehicle is normally expensive and purchased with a small down payment. The vehicle is reported stolen, although in some cases, the owner just abandons the vehicle hoping that it is stolen, stripped for parts, or taken to a pound and destroyed. The scheme sometimes involves homeowner’s insurance for the property that was “stolen” in the vehicle. |  
28 | Insurance Fraud 4 | The indemnity against loss to a third party when the insured fails to fulfill a specific undertaking for the third party's benefit is referred to as: | An indemnity bond | Fidelity insurance | Casualty insurance | Disability insurance | 1.1101 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Insurance Fraud | INSURANCE FRAUD; Types of Insurance Policies | Types of Insurance Policies | Disability insurance indemnifies against income loss under defined circumstances. Life insurance indemnifies for the death of the insured. Fidelity insurance indemnifies against economic loss to the insured because of employee dishonesty. Bonds indemnify against loss to third-party beneficiaries when the insured fails to fulfill a specific undertaking for the third  party’s benefit. |  
29 | Inventory and Other Assets 29 | Black's Law Dictionary defines which of the following as "felonious stealing, taking and carrying... away another's personal property with intent to convert it or deprive the owner thereof? | Larceny | Stealing | Theft | Skimming | 1.602 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Inventory and Other Assets | Theft of Inventory and Other Assets; Larceny Schemes | Larceny Schemes | Larceny Schemes  The textbook definition of larceny is “Felonious stealing, taking and carrying, leading, riding, or driving away another’s personal property, with intent to convert it or to deprive owner thereof. The unlawful taking and carrying away of property of another with intent to appropriate it to use inconsistent with latter’s rights.” 1 This definition is so broad, it encompasses every kind of asset theft. In order to gain a more specific understanding of the methods used to steal inventory and other assets, the definition of larceny has been restricted. For the purposes of classifying asset misappropriations, the term larceny is meant to refer to the most basic type of inventory theft, the schemes in which an employee simply takes inventory from the company premises without attempting to conceal the theft in the books and records. (See “Non-cash Larceny” flowchart.) In other fraud schemes, employees may create false documentation to justify the shipment of merchandise or tamper with inventory records to conceal missing assets. Larceny schemes are more blunt. The culprit in these crimes takes company assets without trying to “justify” their absence. |   
30 | Money Laundering 15 | The stage in which money laundering schemes are most often detected is called: | Placement | Integration | Washing | Layering | 1.1601 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Money Laundering | MONEY LAUNDERING; Introduction; The Money Laundering Process; Placement | Placement | Placement Placement of funds into a financial institution is the initial step in the process. It is at this step that legislation has been developed to prevent launderers from depositing or converting large amounts of cash at financial institutions or taking cash out of the country. Money laundering schemes are most often detected at this stage. |  
31 | Money Laundering 16 | XYZ Company deposits an extra $20,000 a month in its bank account although there are no recorded sales for that amount. At the end of the year, the company has an extra $240,000 in its account. This type of money laundering scheme is most properly referred to as: | Balance sheet laundering | Overstatement of reported expenses | Overstatement of reported revenues | Smurfing | 1.1604 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Money Laundering | Overstatement of Reported Expenses; Depositing Cash and Writing Checks in Excess of Reported Revenues and Expenses (Balance Sheet Laundering) | Depositing Cash and Writing Checks in Excess of Reported Revenues and Expenses (Balance Sheet Laundering) | Depositing Cash and Writing Checks in Excess of Reported Revenues and Expenses (Balance Sheet Laundering) Rather than attempting to disguise money as normal business revenue, excess funds can simply be deposited into the bank account of the business. This technique is known as Financial Transactions  Money Laundering 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1605 balance sheet laundering because it is independent of the money that flows in and out of  the business. |
32 | Money Laundering 2 | The use of a legitimate business enterprise as a front to conceal and co-mingle illicit dollars is an example of what type of scheme? | Money laundering | Fictitious vendor | Fictitious trade payable | Money hiding | 1.1603 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Money Laundering | Using a Legitimate Business to Launder Funds; Overstatement of Reported Revenues | Using a Legitimate Business to Launder Funds | Using a Legitimate Business to Launder Funds One of the most common methods of laundering funds is to filter the money through a legitimate business, otherwise known as a “front” business. A front business can be a very effective way to launder money because it provides a safe place for organizing and managing criminal activity, where the comings and goings of large numbers of people will not arouse undue suspicion. In addition, a front that does legitimate business provides cover for delivery and transportation related to illegal activity. The expenses from illegal activity can be attributed to the legitimate enterprise, and illegal revenues can be easily placed into the enterprise. |
33 | Money Laundering 20 | The title of the Congressional legislation passed in October of 2001 that aimed to curtail money laundering, particularly to prevent financing of terrorist activities, is referred to as which of the following? | The USA PATRIOT Act | The Anti-Money Laundering Act | The Anti-Terrorism Act | The Privacy Act | 1.1615 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Money Laundering | Signs of a Hawala Exchange; Federal and State Law; PATRIOT Act of 2001 | PATRIOT Act of 2001 | PATRIOT Act of 2001 On October 26, 2001, President George W. Bush signed into law the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act  (the PATRIOT Act). The PATRIOT Act was a response to the tragedies of September 11, 2001, and reflected Congressional concern with the money laundering activities of the terrorists who committed those attacks. |   
34 | Money Laundering 4 | Page, a Certified Fraud Examiner is investigating the sources of income of a suspect. Page notices that funds available to the suspect include the suspect's interest in a restaurant/bar. Page has surveyed the establishment several times and notices that the business, even during peak times, is minimal. Yet the income reported from this restaurant/bar is phenomenal. Of the following list, which scheme might the suspect be involved in? | Money laundering | Overstatement of expenses | Conflict of interest | Bankruptcy fraud | 1.1601 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Money Laundering | MONEY LAUNDERING; Introduction; The Money Laundering Process; Placement | Introduction | Introduction Money laundering is the disguising of the existence, nature, source, ownership, location, and disposition of property derived from criminal activity. Although it is not currently possible to quantify the total volume of money laundered globally or in the U.S., it is clearly an enormous problem existing within every financial system. Nevertheless, the continuing demand to know how much money is laundered annually has led many organizations to calculate and offer their own estimations. For example, the International Monetary Fund estimated that money laundering caused a total monetary loss of $590 billion to $1.5 trillion globally in 1996, the United Nations estimated a loss of $500 billion to $1 trillion globally in 2005, and a 2007 KPMG survey found that money-laundering flows exceed $1 trillion per year. | 
35 | Public Sector Fraud 22 | Beneficiary frauds are most likely to be perpetrated by which of the following? | Individuals | Medical professionals | Lawyers | Organized crime rings | 1.1915 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Public Sector Fraud | Altered or Missing Documents; Photocopied or Duplicate Documents; Failure to Have Adequate Supporting Documentation for Reports and Summary Data; Beneficiary Fraud | Beneficiary Fraud | Beneficiary Fraud Beneficiary frauds tend to be perpetrated by individuals, without collusion or bribery. The motive for this type of fraud is personal gain (or reduction of loss) by the perpetrator. |  
36 | Public Sector Fraud 24 | Fred is an employee of a state agency. Although Fred is not suspected of criminal activity, it is believed that he may have knowledge of the criminal activity of a supervisor. Can Fred be fired if he refuses to answer questions regarding his supervisor? | Yes | No | 1.1926 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Public Sector Fraud | The Warning Dilemma | The Warning Dilemma | The Warning Dilemma A crucial element in interviewing a high official, as with the interview of any public employee, is proper regard for the Constitutional rights of the subject. A series of cases in the 1960s — such as Murphy v. Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, 378 U.S. 52 (1964), Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493 (1967) and Gardner v. Broderick,  392 U.S. 273 (1968) — are instructive. In short, the United States Supreme Court held that a public employee cannot be compelled to answer job-related questions concerning his own possible criminal conduct under threat of disciplinary action, e.g., removal, without violating his rights under the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The choice between job forfeiture and self-incrimination, said the Court, is inherently coercive and, in effect, a choice “between the rock and the whirlpool.” Put another way, a public employee cannot be put in a position wherein he will incriminate himself if he tells the truth, will subject himself to perjury prosecution if he lies, or will set himself up for a removal action if he refuses to cooperate. Thus, the issue of what warning(s), if any, to give the subject must be addressed. |  
37 | Securities Fraud 17 | Which of the following is an example of a self-regulatory organization? | FINRA | SEC | CIA | FBI | 1.1513 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Securities Fraud | Self-Regulatory Organizations | Self-Regulatory Organizations | Self-Regulatory Organizations SEC delegates significant regulatory authority to “self-regulatory organizations” (SROs). SROs oversee the markets they operate and police the member firms participating in those markets. SROs create and enforce rules dealing with such areas as securities listings, exchange and settlement procedures, and member qualifications.  The Maloney Act of 1938 amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to allow the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) to regulate the business of members subject to Securities and Exchange Commission oversight.   In 2007, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) was created through the consolidation of NASD and the member regulation, enforcement, and arbitration functions of the New York Stock Exchange. FINRA is dedicated to investor protection and market integrity through effective and efficient regulation and complementary compliance and technology-based services. |

43 | Securities Fraud 26 | The ______________ test is an alternative to the Howey test that many courts use in securities fraud cases. | Risk Capital | Investment skills | Profit management | Risk management | 1.1518 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Securities Fraud | Risk Capital Test; Examples of Investment Contracts; PONZI SCHEMES | Risk Capital Test | Risk Capital Test  As an alternative to the Howey Test many state and federal courts are using the so-called “Risk Capital Test.” This “test” allows the invest or to play a more active role if the funds he contributes are part of the “risk capital” of the business. A person entrusts money or other capital to another with the expectation of deriving a profit. The failure or success of the venture is dependent upon the managerial efforts of the other person. Several states have formally adopted this test, sometimes known as the Hawaii Market Test, as an alternative definition of investment contract. However, the Supreme Court has expressly declined to decide if this test should be used. | 
44 | Securities Fraud 28 | A financial advisor knows of a large order to sell a particular security. Knowing the order will certainly cause the stock price to fall, the advisor sells his shares of the stock at the higher price before he places the customer's order. This practice is called: | Front running | Conversion | Parking | Churning | 1.1534 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Securities Fraud | Failure to Supervise; Failure to Report Client Complaints; Parking; Front Running — Dual Trading | Front Running — Dual Trading | Front Running — Dual Trading Front running an order is a type of insider trading. Although it usually will not cause a direct loss to the customer, it could, and is a violation of exchange rules. Front running involves the use for profit of the privileged knowledge of a customer’s order to buy or sell a large amount of a commodity, options, or security that, because of its size, is likely to move the market. Back office personnel could have knowledge of such an order and buy or sell for their own account ahead of the customer. Because order fillers on the exchange floor are allowed to trade for their own account and fill orders for customers (dual trading) they also have an opportunity.   Financial Transactions  Securities Fraud 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1535 Consider the following scenario: an order is received from a hedger to sell 500 December cattle futures contracts at the market. If the order filler knows that current market conditions are such that this order will move the market significantly lower, it would be very tempting to sell a few contracts for himself and profit from the market decline when he executes the customer order. Order fillers are required to operate in the best interest of the customer and “work” the order to get the best price. However, once the trader has established his short position, it is really in his own interest to drive the market as far down as possible when executing the 500 contract sell order. In this situation, the order filler may not give his best efforts and could hurt the customer. |

It should be noted that this provision does not provide universal whistleblower protection; it  only protects employees of publicly traded companies. Section 806 makes it unlawful to fire, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner discriminate against an employee for providing information or aiding in an investigation of securities fraud. In order to trigger § 806 protections, the employee must report the suspected misconduct to a federal regulatory or law enforcement agency, a member of Congress or a committee of Congress, or a supervisor. Employees are also protected against retaliation for filing, testifying in, participating in, or otherwise assisting in a Securities Fraud  Financial Transactions   1.1510                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  proceeding filed or about to be filed relating to an alleged violation of securities laws or  SEC rules. |

SROs oversee the markets they operate and police the member firms participating in those markets. SROs create and enforce rules dealing with such areas as securities listings, exchange and settlement procedures, and member qualifications.  The Maloney Act of 1938 amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to allow the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) to regulate the business of members subject to Securities and Exchange Commission oversight.   In 2007, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) was created through the consolidation of NASD and the member regulation, enforcement, and arbitration functions of the New York Stock Exchange. FINRA is dedicated to investor protection and market integrity through effective and efficient regulation and complementary compliance and technology-based services. |

If the answer is “yes,” then this information, or the lack thereof, has a high likelihood of being deemed material. (If an actual investor acted based on the misrepresentation, that clearly strengthens the case, but it is not essential that the false or misleading statement influenced an investor, merely that a reasonable investor could have been so influenced.) |

Trade secrets or highly sensitive information might be labeled “authorized access only.” Notes and drafts of documents should also be safeguarded or destroyed when the final document is completed. |  
53 | Criminology 14 | Funds are missing from the bank account of ABC Co. The fraud examiner assigned to the case begins thinking, "Who had the opportunity and the motive to get at this money"? Probably unknowingly, the fraud examiner is performing a __________________ analysis. | Behaviorist | Theorist | Empirical | Categorical | 4.101 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Criminology | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence; UNDERSTANDING HUMAN BEHAVIOR; Behavioral Analysis and the Detection of Fraud | Behavioral Analysis and the Detection of Fraud | Behavioral Analysis and the Detection of Fraud When a detective searches for a suspect’s motive, the detective is using behaviorist methods of analysis. The suspect, it is assumed, was stimulated by some arrangement of factors. Many courses in criminology are built around the fundamental premise that crimes are particular sorts of behavior and best understood as the product of operant conditioning. Fraud examiners often use the same methods in approaching a case. When money is missing, the examiner traces the known flow of funds and then asks, “Who had the opportunity and the motive to get at this money?” Even without being conscious of the fact, the examiner is performing a behaviorist analysis on the crime. |
54 | Criminology 3 | Behavioral studies show that ________________ is the least effective method of changing behavior. | Punishment | Rewards | Positive reinforcement | Conditioning | 4.102 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Criminology | Behavioral Analysis and Detection of Fraud | Behavioral studies such as those conducted by Skinner show that punishment is the least effective method of changing behavior. Punishing brings “a temporary suppression of the behavior,” but only with constant supervision and application. In repeated experiments, Skinner found that punishment — either applying a negative stimulus, or taking away a positive one — effectively extinguished a subject’s behavior, but that the behavior returned “when the punishment was discontinued... and eventually all responses came out” again. The subject would suppress the behavior as long as the punishment was applied directly and continually, but as soon as the punishment was withdrawn for a while, the behavior was attempted again; if there was no punishment following the attempt, the subject began to behave as before. |

56 | Ethics for Fraud Examiners 4 | Under the ACFE Code of Professional Ethics, evidence and conclusions are considered __________________ if knowledge of them would affect clients' decisions based on a Certified Fraud Examiner's report. | Material | Extraneous | Confidential | Opinions | 4.1020 | Fraud Prevention and Deterrence | Ethics for Fraud Examiners | Professional Improvement | Complete Reporting of Material Matters | ACFE Code of Professional Ethics   Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 4.1020   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     Evidence and conclusions are material if knowledge of them would affect clients’ decisions based on a Certified Fraud Examiner’s report. Materiality  is a user-oriented concept. If matters omitted from a report were known to the users, and their own perceptions and conclusions would be different in light of this knowledge, the omitted information is material. Certified Fraud Examiners are placed in the difficult position of determining not what they themselves consider important and material, but rather what they think users will consider important and material. They need to project a decision-making process onto the users instead of simply being introspective. |
