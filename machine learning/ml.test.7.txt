Some recipients spend their money less conspicuously by paying off debts or paying down mortgages.  • The Gift Taker — An official or executive who regularly accepts inappropriate gifts is often one susceptible to larger payments. • The Odd Couple” — Corrupt payers and recipients often  appear to have very friendly social relationships. Frequent outside contacts, particularly between parties who do not appear to have much in common, might be a sign of deeper and more troublesome ties between the parties. • The Rule Breaker — This is often the most significant characteristic. A person taking payoffs will often take action on his own, or direct a subordinate to bend, break, or ignore standard operating procedures or rules to benefit the payer. Particular attention should be directed toward those who insert themselves into areas in which they are normally not involved or attempt to assert authority or make decisions for which they are not responsible. • The Complainer — A corrupt recipient often makes excuses for deficiencies in the payer’s services, such as poor quality, late deliveries, or high prices. Look for higher prices, Financial Transactions  Bribery and Corruption 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.717 extra” payments, or commissions approved by the suspect, because these might be the source of kickback fraud. • Genuine Need — Greed, rather than need, seems to be the motivating factor in most cases. Occasionally, however, legitimate pressures, such as illness of family members or drug addiction, can induce participation in an illegal scheme.|0.0448776728514074

The most important of the above information (and often the only information needed) is the bank account information. Begin by examining the checks, check register, and/or the cash disbursement journal and paying particular attention to the following: • Payables and expenses charged to the account (cust omer) on which the illicit payments were made — If the examiner suspects that kickbacks were paid on sales to the ABC Corporation, for example, look at the payables and expenses charged to that account/customer. • Payments for services — Check payments for services such as sales commissions or consulting fees, which do not require the delivery of goods and need relatively little documentation to obtain payment. • Anomalous charges — For the business, an example of anomalous payments can be those for design fees paid by a company that is engaged in business that normally would not require such services.  • The endorsement on the check — This might be by signature, or more commonly, by a stamp in the name of the business payee. Note the identity of the endorser. (Some corrupt Bribery and Corruption  Financial Transactions   1.724                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  recipients have been known to endorse such checks in their own name.) • The location where the check was negotiated —If not obvious from the endorsement, identify the bank where the deposit was made by checking the depository bank’s stamp on the back of the check. The geographical location of the depository bank is an important lead that can connect the check to the suspected recipient. Determining the depository bank’s identity is critical to obtaining the recipient’s bank account information. • Checks with a second endorsement — A typical indication of a phony payable check is one paid to, and endorsed by, a business, which is then endorsed by an individual, thereby permitting it to be cashed or deposited in a personal account. In similar fashion, a check payable to a third party can be signed over to the issuer of the check. • Cashed (not deposited) checks payable to a business — Generally, a For Deposit Only” stamp appears on the back of deposited checks, although this is not always the case. Most banks have a code stamp that indicates whether the check was cashed or not. These codes vary, and can be obtained from the bank where the check was negotiated. • Checks that fall into an unexplained pattern — An example of a suspicious payable scheme is one where checks are drawn once a month in an amount equal to some percentage of the sales against which they are charged, and are not otherwise explained. Such a pattern might indicate a kickback scheme. If an examination of the checks themselves does not yield any clear leads, compare the various records of payment with the backup documentation. Note particularly the following circumstances: • The absence of documentation — The absence of documentation to support a particular payment can include: ? No invoice appearing in the files for a payment to a supplier or contractor. ? No receipt to indicate that materials paid for were delivered. ? No consultant’s work product to substantiate consulting fees paid. • Discrepancies — Discrepancies between payment information and backup documentation can include: ? A check payable to a supplier in an amount different than his invoice. ? A check payable to a person or entity different than that identified on the invoice. • Anomalies in support documents — Anomalies in the backup documentation can include invoices from several suppliers in different names that: ? Have the same business address. ? Are signed by the same person. ? Returned to a post office box.  • Unnumbered or sequentially numbered invoices — An example of an invoice scam uses invoices numbered 101, 102, and 103, which are dated 30 days apart. Of course, it is highly Financial Transactions  Bribery and Corruption 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.725 unlikely that a legitimate business would refrain from issuing invoices in the interim. • Alterations — Copies of originals can be made for concealing alterations of original documents. Examples can include alterations or photocopies of backup papers.  • Location and other information on the invoices that tie it to the suspected recipient — If the above steps still do not yield any suspect payments, return to the check registers and cash disbursement journals to look for discrepancies between the entries and the checks or backup documentation, or their absence. The register and journals might also indicate the purpose of payments made by wire, cashier’s check, or cash.|0.0171943783779411

By using a toll-free 800 number that then links the caller to the per-minute charges, promoters are able to surreptitiously begin charging customers for calls. 800 numbers are often used as a front in telemarketing operations to lead consumers to think that a call is free, when in fact there are hidden charges everywhere. A particularly vicious combination uses a toll-free number to make a presentation about communication services. Once the caller dials in, the Financial Transactions  Consumer Fraud 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1725 computerized service automatically puts a monthly charge, sometimes labeled voicemail,” on the caller’s phone bill.    Many operations familiar to law enforcement as  traditional boiler rooms moved into the toll numbers when they became widely available in the 1980s.

Long-term construction contracts, for example, use either the completed-contract method or the percentage-of-completion method, depending partly on the circumstances. The completed-contract method does not record revenue until the project is 100 percent complete. Construction costs are held in an inventory account until completion of the project. The percentage-of-completion method recognizes revenues and expenses as measurable progress on a project is made, but this method is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.

In July 2006, the GAO issued an update to its 2002 report, Financial Statement Restatements: Trends, Market Impacts, Regulatory Responses, and Remaining Challenges. The original report was based on the GAO’s analysis of 689 of 919 financial statement restatements occurring from January 1, 1997 through June 30, 2002. To update the information in the original, the GAO undertook a similar analysis of 1,390 public company restatements that occurred between January 1, 2002 and September 30, 2005. The following are some of the findings of the two studies:  • The percentage of publicly traded companies announcing restatements increased from less than one percent in 1997 to over three percent by the end of 2002. This percentage rose again, to 6.8 percent, by September of 2005.  • The quantity of restatements resulting from accounting irregularities grew from 92 in 1997 to 314 in 2002, or approximately 241 percent. In the first 9 months of 2005 (through September 30), there were 523 restatements announced, which amounted to an increase of approximately 67 percent from 2002 and more than 468 percent from 1997.

By September 30, 2005, the average market capitalization of a company announcing a restatement had grown to $6 billion. • Cost and expense issues were the most common reason for restatements between July 2002 and September 2005. These restatements, which include over- or understating costs or expenses, improper classification of costs, and other misreporting of costs, accounted for over 35 percent of restatements examined during that period. In the 2002 study, cost and expense issues were the second most common reason for restatement, comprising 16 percent of all restatements.  • Twenty percent of the restatements analyzed in the 2006 study were due to revenue recognition issues, making this the second most common reason for restatement during the period studied. This represents a decline from the 2002 study in which revenue recognition was the most common reason for restatement, comprising 38 percent of the population.

In some cases, illegal funds are spent on personal assets, such as homes, cars, jewelry, and furniture. But the typical money launderer will not dispose of all his illegal currency in this manner; he will want to have a certain amount of liquid reserves for spending. Keeping large bundles of cash is inefficient because they are difficult to hide and transport. Therefore, money launderers will often convert substantial portions of their currency into negotiable instruments such as cashier’s checks and money orders, which are routinely issued by financial institutions. Criminals prefer these negotiable instruments for two reasons.

Single and continuing offenses, committed for several objectives or by multiple means, like mail or wire fraud or conspiracy, may be charged in one count, although they alternatively could be charged as separate and distinct counts. Generally, however, if the separate violations are all a part of the same criminal scheme, they can be alleged in the same count. This is sometimes preferable for the defendant because if all of the violations are alleged in one count, it looks to the jury as if the defendant has committed one fraud rather than 50 separate frauds.|0.0245678290637993
