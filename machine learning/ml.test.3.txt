4 | Financial Statement Fraud 9 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Financial Statement Fraud | 16 | 1 | Long-Term Contracts | Revenue is recognized on long-term construction contracts under one of two methods. Which of the following is one of those methods? | Percentage-of-completion method | Disbursement/recovery method | Partial-contract method | Cost-to-market method | Long-Term Contracts  | Long-Term Contracts Long-term contracts pose special problems for revenue recognition. Long-term construction contracts, for example, use either the completed-contract method or the percentage-of-completion method, depending partly on the circumstances. The completed-contract method does not record revenue until the project is 100 percent complete. Construction costs are held in an inventory account until completion of the project. The percentage-of-completion method recognizes revenues and expenses as measurable progress on a project is made, but this method is particularly vulnerable to manipulation. Managers can often easily manipulate the percentage-of-completion and the estimated costs to complete a construction project in order to recognize revenues prematurely and conceal contract overruns. | 
5 | Money Laundering 26 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Money Laundering | 5 | 1 | Integration | A money laundering scheme cannot be successful until the _______________ is eliminated or made so complex that individual steps cannot be easily traced. | Paper trail | Placement | Integration | Reporting | A money laundering s | A money laundering scheme cannot be successful until the paper trail is eliminated or made so complex that the flow of illegal income cannot be easily traced. The number of steps used to launder funds depends on how much distance the money launderer wishes to put between the illegally earned cash and the laundered asset into which it is converted. A greater number of steps increases the complexity of tracing the funds, but it also increases the length of the paper trail and the chance that the transaction will be reported. | 
6 | Covert Examinations 39 | Investigation | Covert Examinations | 5 | 2 | Surveillance | Which of the following is one of the two general types of surveillance? | Mobile | Undercover | Covert | Electronic | There are two genera | There are two general types of surveillance: mobile and fixed. Mobile surveillance is sometimes referred to as “tailing” or “shadowing ,” and fixed surveillance as a “stakeout” or “plant.” Mobile surveillance can be done on foot or by vehicle and is carried out when people being observed move from location to location. A fixed surveillance is used when a person or activity remains in place, although the observers might move from one vantage point to another in the immediate area. | 
7 | Data Analysis 2 | Investigation | Data Analysis | 6 | 1 | Sorting | If you _________________ data, you arrange the data in a meaningful order. | Sort | Duplicate | Verify | Join | Sorting To sort mean | Sorting To sort means to arrange data in a meaningful order. Sorting is nothing new; most reports you read are sorted in some way. With sorted data, you can quickly pick out what is important. An investigator can ask a program to sort information using different methods, such as alphabetically or numerically. For instance, when searching for a suspected fraudster’s name out of thousands in a check disbursement file, the software can quickly sort a list of payee names. | 
8 | Data Analysis 8 | Investigation | Data Analysis | 13 | 1 | Duplicate Searches | Alpha, a fraud examiner, believes that vendors may be submitting invoices twice with the hope that they will be paid multiple times. Which of the following data analysis functions would be the most useful in identifying such invoices? | Duplicate search | Horizontal analysis | Vertical analysis | Correlation analysis | Duplicate Searches F | Duplicate Searches Fraud examiners and auditors can perform searches on invoice disbursements numerically to see if any invoices have been paid twice. By cross-checking the invoices with the vendors paid, duplicate billing can be easy to catch. |

This may aid in discovering passwords needed to access encrypted data if the subject of the investigation is being uncooperative. | 
10 | Illicit Transactions 40 | Investigation | Illicit Transactions | 36 | 1 | ON_US ITEMS | A check or draft that is presented for payment where the depository bank is also the payor bank is a: | On-us item | Clearinghouse item | Deposit ticket | Negotiated check | ON-US ITEMS An on-us | ON-US ITEMS An on-us item  is a check or draft that is presented for payment where the depository bank is also the payor bank. For example, a check written by a customer of one bank is deposited by the payee at another branch of the same bank. The bank should be able to trace the source of any on-us items. The source might be loan proceeds, certificates of deposit, wire transfers, bank checks, or checks from other deposits at that bank. If the deposit is the proceeds from a loan, obtain and analyze the loan file (examination of the loan file is discussed later in this chapter). If the deposit came from a wire transfer, trace the wire transfer to the originating bank to see where the funds for the wire transfer originated. This search could lead to other accounts, other witnesses, co-conspirators, or offshore transactions. | 
11 | Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud 23 | Law | Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud | 34 | 1 | Jury Selection | The procedure by which the prosecution or defense dismisses a prospective juror without giving a reason is called: | A peremptory challenge | The dedi et concessi | The voir dire | The declinatory challenge | The third way to dis | The third way to dismiss jurors is by exercising a peremptory challenge. A peremptory challenge  allows a litigant to remove someone from the jury panel without comment or justification. Peremptory challenges allow a party to remove a juror for virtually any reason. A party, however, cannot use its peremptory challenges in a way that is solely influenced by race, ethnicity, or gender. And unlike challenges for cause, peremptory challenges are limited in number. | 
12 | Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud 39 | Law | Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud | 12 | 1 | Arraignment | In certain circumstances, the defendant may be allowed to plead guilty, although continuing to assert his or her innocence. This procedure is called: | The Alford plea | The Brady plea | The Johnson plea | The Katz plea | Before the court wil | Before the court will accept a guilty plea, it must follow procedures to ensure that the plea is voluntary and accurate; that is, that there is a “factual basis” for the plea. This usually means that the defendant must admit to committing acts that satisfy each element of the offense. In some circumstances, however, a defendant may be allowed to enter an Alford plea (named after the Supreme Court case that upheld the practice) under which he pleads guilty, Law  Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.509 although continuing to assert innocence. Such a plea may be made to obtain the benefits of a plea agreement and to avoid potentially more dire consequences, such as the death penalty, if the defendant is convicted after trial. Before the court accepts an Alford  plea, it must determine that there is strong evidence of guilt and that the defendant understands the consequences. | 
13 | Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud 66 | Law | Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud | 34 | 1 | Jury Selection | The process by which counsel or the court asks questions of potential jurors is called: | Voir dire | Venire | Peremptory challenge | Res judicata | Most criminal cases  | Most criminal cases are tried by a jury of 12 with at least two alternates, but the parties may stipulate to a lesser number. The jury is expected to be impartial. For the jury selection process, called voir dire, the prospective jurors are brought into the courtroom, and they are questioned by the parties or the court to determine their suitability. Jurors are asked about their background, employment, general beliefs and principles, knowledge of the actual case or cases like it, whether they know any of the parties in the case or their attorneys—virtually anything that might elucidate the potential juror’s state of mind is fair game. (Provided, of course, the material is relevant to the case; outright character assassination is not part of jury selection, though some jurors have felt otherwise, especially in high-publicity trials.) | 
14 | Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud 73 | Law | Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud | 31 | 3 | Exculpatory Information (Brady Material) | As a general proposition, the government must disclose information helpful to the defense prior to trial. This information is known as: | Brady material | Greene material | Katz material | Merkley material | Exculpatory Informat | Exculpatory Information (Brady Material) The prosecutor has an ethical responsibility not to use evidence that is false and must correct testimony that he knows is false. In 1963, the Supreme Court (in the case of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83) expanded the prosecution’s duty further. Under Brady, the prosecution must disclose all evidence requested by the defendant that is material to guilt or punishment (i.e., evidence that would tend to exculpate  him or reduce his penalty). The Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud  Law 2.516  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  government is expressly forbidden from concealing evidence that would call the charges into question. |

Miranda warnings are required only if a person is being interrogated by public authorities in a custodial setting. Custodial setting refers to questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody, or otherwise deprived of his freedom or action in any significant way. As a result, both private and public employers might interview employees in noncustodial settings without giving Miranda warnings. |
