They frequently pick a particular establishment or store and observe its security methods. Any store that scrutinizes check writers’ identification is not a good target for a paperhanger. However, they will observe and select the least experienced or most lackadaisical of store employees to whom to pass the check. The paperhanger will then ask the clerk for cash back from the transaction and make the check out for an amount greater than the price of the purchase. In some cases, the checks being written are counterfeit; however, in other cases the checks are purposefully being written on a closed account. A variation of this scam is making a fraudulent deposit at a bank and asking for cash back. |

With loan participations, the lead bank generally performs the underwriting. However, this does not relieve the participating bank from its obligation to perform its own due diligence. If the participating bank does not independently examine the documentation and perform its own due diligence, then fraud schemes on the part of the selling institution are possible. |

This method is often referred to as “common sizing” financial statements. In the vertical analysis of an income statement, net sales is assigned 100 percent. For a balance sheet, total assets is assigned 100 percent on the asset side, and total liabilities and equity is expressed as 100 percent. All other items in each of the sections are expressed as a percentage of these numbers. |

The unlawful taking and carrying away of property of another with intent to appropriate it to use inconsistent with latter’s rights.” 1 This definition is so broad, it encompasses every kind of asset theft. In order to gain a more specific understanding of the methods used to steal inventory and other assets, the definition of larceny has been restricted. For the purposes of classifying asset misappropriations, the term larceny is meant to refer to the most basic type of inventory theft, the schemes in which an employee simply takes inventory from the company premises without attempting to conceal the theft in the books and records. (See “Non-cash Larceny” flowchart.) In other fraud schemes, employees may create false documentation to justify the shipment of merchandise or tamper with inventory records to conceal missing assets. Larceny schemes are more blunt. The culprit in these crimes takes company assets without trying to “justify” their absence. |

A front business can be a very effective way to launder money because it provides a safe place for organizing and managing criminal activity, where the comings and goings of large numbers of people will not arouse undue suspicion. In addition, a front that does legitimate business provides cover for delivery and transportation related to illegal activity. The expenses from illegal activity can be attributed to the legitimate enterprise, and illegal revenues can be easily placed into the enterprise. |

Of the following list, which scheme might the suspect be involved in? | Money laundering | Overstatement of expenses | Conflict of interest | Bankruptcy fraud | Introduction Money launde | Introduction Money laundering is the disguising of the existence, nature, source, ownership, location, and disposition of property derived from criminal activity. Although it is not currently possible to quantify the total volume of money laundered globally or in the U.S., it is clearly an enormous problem existing within every financial system. Nevertheless, the continuing demand to know how much money is laundered annually has led many organizations to calculate and offer their own estimations. For example, the International Monetary Fund estimated that money laundering caused a total monetary loss of $590 billion to $1.5 trillion globally in 1996, the United Nations estimated a loss of $500 billion to $1 trillion globally in 2005, and a 2007 KPMG survey found that money-laundering flows exceed $1 trillion per year. |

A person entrusts money or other capital to another with the expectation of deriving a profit. The failure or success of the venture is dependent upon the managerial efforts of the other person. Several states have formally adopted this test, sometimes known as the Hawaii Market Test, as an alternative definition of investment contract. However, the Supreme Court has expressly declined to decide if this test should be used. | 
43 | Securities Fraud 28 | Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes | Securities Fraud | 64 | 1 | Front Running — Dual Trading | A financial advisor knows of a large order to sell a particular security. Knowing the order will certainly cause the stock price to fall, the advisor sells his shares of the stock at the higher price before he places the customer's order. This practice is called: | Front running | Conversion | Parking | Churning | Front Running — Dual Trad | Front Running — Dual Trading Front running an order is a type of insider trading. Although it usually will not cause a direct loss to the customer, it could, and is a violation of exchange rules. Front running involves the use for profit of the privileged knowledge of a customer’s order to buy or sell a large amount of a commodity, options, or security that, because of its size, is likely to move the market. Back office personnel could have knowledge of such an order and buy or sell for their own account ahead of the customer. Because order fillers on the exchange floor are allowed to trade for their own account and fill orders for customers (dual trading) they also have an opportunity.   Financial Transactions  Securities Fraud 2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1535 Consider the following scenario: an order is received from a hedger to sell 500 December cattle futures contracts at the market. If the order filler knows that current market conditions are such that this order will move the market significantly lower, it would be very tempting to sell a few contracts for himself and profit from the market decline when he executes the customer order. Order fillers are required to operate in the best interest of the customer and “work” the order to get the best price. However, once the trader has established his short position, it is really in his own interest to drive the market as far down as possible when executing the 500 contract sell order. In this situation, the order filler may not give his best efforts and could hurt the customer. |

Section 806 makes it unlawful to fire, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner discriminate against an employee for providing information or aiding in an investigation of securities fraud. In order to trigger § 806 protections, the employee must report the suspected misconduct to a federal regulatory or law enforcement agency, a member of Congress or a committee of Congress, or a supervisor.

The suspect, it is assumed, was stimulated by some arrangement of factors. Many courses in criminology are built around the fundamental premise that crimes are particular sorts of behavior and best understood as the product of operant conditioning. Fraud examiners often use the same methods in approaching a case. When money is missing, the examiner traces the known flow of funds and then asks, “Who had the opportunity and the motive to get at this money?” Even without being conscious of the fact, the examiner is performing a behaviorist analysis on the crime. |

Punishing brings “a temporary suppression of the behavior,” but only with constant supervision and application. In repeated experiments, Skinner found that punishment — either applying a negative stimulus, or taking away a positive one — effectively extinguished a subject’s behavior, but that the behavior returned “when the punishment was discontinued... and eventually all responses came out” again. The subject would suppress the behavior as long as the punishment was applied directly and continually, but as soon as the punishment was withdrawn for a while, the behavior was attempted again; if there was no punishment following the attempt, the subject began to behave as before. |

If matters omitted from a report were known to the users, and their own perceptions and conclusions would be different in light of this knowledge, the omitted information is material. Certified Fraud Examiners are placed in the difficult position of determining not what they themselves consider important and material, but rather what they think users will consider important and material. They need to project a decision-making process onto the users instead of simply being introspective. |

Cress | What Is Fraud Risk? Cressey’s fraud triangle teaches us that there are three interrelated elements that enable someone to commit fraud: the motive  that drives a person to want to commit the fraud, the opportunity  that enables him to commit the fraud, and the ability to rationalize  the fraudulent behavior. The vulnerability that an organization has to those capable of overcoming all three elements of the fraud triangle is fraud risk. Fraud risk can come from sources both internal and external to the organization. |

Fraud risk assessment  is a process aimed at proactively identifying and addressing an organization’s vulnerabilities to internal and external fraud. As every organization is different, the fraud risk assessment process is often more an art than a science. What gets evaluated and how it gets assessed should be tailored to the organization — there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Additionally, organizational fraud risks continually change. It is therefore important to think about a fraud risk assessment as an ongoing, continuous process, rather than just an activity. |

Some 60 percent of the firms had at least one case against them; for those companies, the average number of violations was 4.4. The oil, pharmaceutical, and motor vehicle industries were the most likely to be charged for wrongdoing, a matter that may be a function of enforcement priorities or a true reflection of their activities. |

In no case may probation run for more than five years. The Guidelines also recommend conditions for probation in various circumstances. These conditions include:  • Publicizing the nature of the offense, the organization’s conviction, the punishment imposed, and the steps taken to prevent the recurrence of a similar offense • Providing periodic reports to the court of the organization’s financial condition and expenses • Requiring the organization to submit to examinations of the organization’s business records and to interviews of knowledgeable employees • Requiring the organization to notify the court upon learning of a material adverse change to its financial condition or the commencement of any major legal proceedings, including bankruptcy, or any investigation by authorities • Requiring periodic payments under the court’s specifications, with priority in the order of restitution, fine, and any other monetary sanction • Developing a program to avoid violations of law and a schedule to implement it • Notifying the organization’s employees and shareholders of its violation and its program to avoid and detect violations of law Organizational Crime  Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 4.524   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     • Reporting to the court on the organization’s implementation of a program to avoid and detect violations of law and disclosing any investigation by authorities |

Under most state laws, an offender is eligible for parole after serving one-third of his sentence. Parole decisions usually are made by a board or a commission, based on its members’ conclusion regarding whether the offe nder will remain at liberty without violating the law. There is pressure on parole board members to be notably conservative in their actions, because any repetition of an offense by someone they release, particularly if the offense is heinous, will trigger community outrage against the board. On the other hand, overcrowded prison conditions dictate early release to make room for newcomers. |

The distinction in this category is that if the accomplice/witness informant were not feeding information to investigators, he would be liable to be prosecuted for the same offense. The accomplice informant is often persuaded to “spill the beans” on a co-conspirator in exchange for leniency in the prosecution phase of the investigation. | 
73 | Sources of Information 47 | Investigation | Sources of Information | 301 | 1 | CREDIT HEADER SEARCHES | A suspect's Social Security number can most easily be obtained through which of the following online searches? | Credit bureau header search | Voter registration search | Motor vehicle record search | Court judgment search | CREDIT HEADER SEARCHES Cr | CREDIT HEADER SEARCHES Credit header searches are among the most powerful locator tools. These searches return information from credit reports on individuals. They are a valuable source because almost all people have been involved in some credit activity either under their true names or an assumed (or known as) name. It is appropriate to keep in mind that for common names, it may be necessary to use the Social Security number or date of birth to differentiate the subject from other people with the same name. The credit bureau headers offer two search mechanisms. First, the examiner can discover a current address, an address history, and Social Security number(s) associated with the target by using a past address up to seven years old. Second, once the Social Security number is in hand, the headers can be searched for matches, because the Social Security number is a national identity number. Although Social Security numbers are protected from disclosure by the Privacy Act, it has become practically impossible for individuals to avoid disclosing them on public records. | 
74 | Data Analysis 1 | Investigation | Data Analysis | 8 | 1 | Joining Files | The ___________________ function is used to match data in a transaction file with records in a master file, such as matching invoice data in an accounts receivable file to a master list of vendors. | Join | Compliance verification | Correlation analysis | Date | Joining Files  The Join f | Joining Files  The Join function gathers together the specified parts of different data files. Joining files combines fields from two sorted input files into a third file. Join is used to match data in a transaction file with records in a master file, such as matching invoice data in an accounts receivable file to a master cluster. For example, you may need to compare two different files to find differing records between files. The following is an example of how joining two files can easily provide that information. | 
75 | Data Analysis 21 | Investigation | Data Analysis | 12 | 1 | Compliance Verification | Beta, a fraud examiner, is concerned that employees are abusing their expense accounts and are spending more than the $30 per day allowed for meals. Beta performs a data analysis on all expense reports to locate any meal expenses greater than $30. This type of data analysis function is called _______________________. | Compliance verification | Horizontal analysis | Vertical analysis | Multi-file processing | Compliance Verification T | Compliance Verification This function determines whether company policies are met by employee transactions. If a company limits the amount of its reimbursements, the software can check to see that this limit is being observed. Many times fraud examiners can find early indications of fraud by testing detail data for values above or below specified amounts. For example, when employees are out of town, do they adhere to the company policy of not spending more than $30 a day for meals? For starters, we can look at the expense reports and select those with meal expenses exceeding $30. With the in formation returned from this simple query, we have a starting point for suspecting fraud. Even though these variances are small ($2 and $3), the time taken to research small variances can be well invested. The trail might lead to something big. After further investigation, you might learn that the employee did not have supporting documentation to submit because a vendor’s sales representative paid for all the meals. If this is the case, you have two fraud suspects, the employee and the employee’s boss who approved the report. |

Usually, a method of documenting these occurrences, along with a review by an independent party, is sufficient to ensure the completeness and accuracy of processing. However, it is rare that a journal entry gap test is performed in the accounting department (it is more common in the accounts payable area related to the check sequence), so this may be the first time this test is being performed. |

When seizing a laptop, it is important to remove the battery first and then pull the plug. It is essential when seizing a laptop to recover all of the components that belong to the laptop, such as flash drives, CD-ROMs and DVD–ROMs, and power supplies. Often, laptop computers must be imaged with their drives installed, and because of the proprietary nature of the laptops themselves, they will only function with their own components. Many  times these components can be located in the laptop carrying case. |

It takes eight bits to make one byte, which is what we are commonly used to hearing when we talk about storage capacity, such as 256 megabytes. One megabyte equals 1024 kilobytes, and one kilobyte equals 1024 bytes. As you can see, one bit is a relatively infinitesimal piece of data, but it is important that not even one bit of data be altered by the forensic process. |

These regulations, known as “Check 21,” created “substitute checks,” a type of negotiable instrument that became the legal equivalent of paper checks. This provision facilitates the efficient collection and return of checks in electronic form by alleviating the collection requirement that depository banks actually send the original paper checks to collecting banks for payment. | 
84 | Illicit Transactions 11 | Investigation | Illicit Transactions | 66 | 1 | DISCOVERY SAMPLING | The following question is representative of what type of sampling?

Most states also require limited partnerships, trusts, and joint ventures to file DBA information at the state or county level. This information will provide insight into the true business venture behind the name. DBA information is very similar to corporate filings with the secretary of state, and they allow examiners to trace the corporation’s roots or  prove ownership in sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited partnerships, joint ventures, and trusts. |

Boolean operators  are symbols that Accessing Information Online  Investigation 3.512   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  help the search engine to better understand exactly what it is searching for. Putting the “+” symbol between “check+fraud,” for example, will indicate to the search engine that it is to search only for pages that have the word fraud immediately following check.  If you insert the word and,  so that the search reads check and fraud, the search engine will understand to search for websites and pages that contain both the words check  and fraud,  but not necessarily right next to each other.   Some of the more common Boolean operator symbols, or connectors, are shown below. |

98 | Civil Justice System 5 | Law | Civil Justice System | 1 | 1 | Civil Litigation | Lawsuits which involve parties from different states and have more than $75,000 in controversy are known as: | Diversity cases | Intrastate cases | Interdiction cases | Interstate cases | Civil Litigation Civil ac | Civil Litigation Civil actions to recover damages for fraud or to enjoin further fraudulent activity can be filed by private plaintiffs in state or federal courts. Most common-law fraud actions, usually styled misrepresentation claims, are filed in state courts. Suits involving parties from different states and involving more than $75,000 in controversy (known as diversity cases), or actions brought on the basis of federal statutes, such as the civil RICO provisions, can be brought in federal court. Federal court generally is preferred by plaintiffs in larger cases because federal courts provide better access to witnesses and documents located in different states. The procedures described below are largely drawn from the federal rules. | 
99 | Civil Justice System 8 | Law | Civil Justice System | 6 | 1 | Oral Depositions | Sworn testimony given by a party upon questioning by counsel before trial and outside of court is referred to as which of the following? | Deposition | Privileged interview | Oath | Subpoena duces tecum | Oral Depositions Depositi | Oral Depositions Depositions are probably the most popular and useful form of discovery. A deposition is sworn testimony given by a party or witness upon questioning by counsel for one of the parties before trial and outside of court, usually in a lawyer’s office. Opposing counsel and a stenographer, who administers the oath and transcribes the testimony, also are present. Deposition testimony may be used to obtain evidence about the party’s own case or the opponent’s, or to preserve testimony for trial. In the federal system, a witness outside the subpoena power of the court can be deposed in the area he resides and the transcript read to the jury at trial. If the deposing attorney wishes to inspect or refer during the proceedings to certain documents in the witness’s possession, these can be demanded by a subpoena duces tecum, a legal order for the witness to produce the documents for reference during the deposition. |

The defendant may plead guilty, not guilty, or nolo contendere. If the defendant pleads guilty, the sentencing phase of the criminal justice process begins. A plea of not guilty sets in motion the adjudicative process as described below. A plea of nolo contendere means the defendant does not contest the charges, without formally admitting or denying them. A defendant may plead nolo only with the consent of the court. If accepted, a nolo plea is the same as a plea of guilty for purposes of punishment, but it cannot be used as a formal admission of guilt. This makes it a favored plea for corporate defendants facing subsequent civil litigation. |

The jury is expected to be impartial. For the jury selection process, called voir dire, the prospective jurors are brought into the courtroom, and they are questioned by the parties or the court to determine their suitability. Jurors are asked about their background, employment, general beliefs and principles, knowledge of the actual case or cases like it, whether they know any of the parties in the case or their attorneys—virtually anything that might elucidate the potential juror’s state of mind is fair game. (Provided, of course, the material is relevant to the case; outright character assassination is not part of jury selection, though some jurors have felt otherwise, especially in high-publicity trials.) |

Direct evidence includes testimony that tends to prove or disprove a fact in issue directly, such as eyewitness testimony or a confession. Circumstantial evidence is evidence that tends to prove or disprove facts in issue indirectly, by inference. Many fraud cases are proved entirely by circumstantial evidence, or by a combination of circumstantial and direct evidence, but seldom by direct evidence alone. The most difficult element to prove in many fraud cases —fraudulent intent — is usually proved circumstantially, and necessarily so, because direct proof of the defendant’s state of mind, absent a confession or the testimony of a co-conspirator, is impossible. |

The elements of larceny typically include: • Unlawfully taking or carrying away • Money or property of another • Without the consent of the owner • With the intent to permanently deprive the owner of its use or possession |

In the trial setting, the jury finds the facts, and the judge applies the law, rules on evidence, and generally moderates the proceeding to ensure a fair trial. If, however, a jury is waived by the defendant and government, the judge decides both the facts and the law. |

Relatively few appeals — “writs” — are granted. The Supreme Court usually hears only those cases that present an important question of constitutional law, or may be used to resolve a “split” or disagreement on a point of law among the circuits, or that have considerable significance to the judicial system beyond the interest of the litigants. If the Supreme Court “denies Cert.,” the lower court decision stands and the appeal process ends unless the defendant can find some collateral ground, such as alleged constitutional errors in state court proceedings, to attack the judgment. As death penalty challenges illustrate, appeals on such points, often brought by people in custody under “Habeas Corpus” proceedings, can sometimes consume a decade or more. |

The Fourth Amendment guarantees the right of all citizens to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. This means that the government may not seize any records in a criminal case unless reasonable grounds exist — “probable cause” — to believe that the records would constitute evidence of a crime, and that a suspect may not be arrested unless there is probable cause to believe that he committed an offense. The Fifth Amendment guarantees subjects of a criminal investigation the right to refuse to answer questions or to provide certain personal information that might be incriminating. The Sixth Amendment affords subjects in a criminal investigation the right to counsel, the right to confront (cross-examine) the witnesses against them, and the right to a speedy trial. |

Substantive law is comprised of the basic laws of rights and duties (contract law, tort law, criminal law, etc.) as opposed to procedural law, which involves rules governing pleadings, evidence, jurisdiction, and so on. If someone says an act is “against the law,” he means substantive law, which includes statutes and ordinances at every level; common law, or Overview of the United States Legal System Law 2.102  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  case law, from all the various courts; and state and federal constitutions. |

This technique often uses the “is it not true?” and “would you agree with me?” approach. Constant agreement is useful to browbeat the expert. In the eyes of the judge and jury, agreement with various questions raised by the opposing counsel also might be assumed to be a general concurrence with the position of the opposing counsel.  |

During cross-examination, the opposing counsel tries to imply that Able has examined only one area of the case and that his investigation was limited in extent or scope. The technique that the opposing counsel is using is called: | Myopic vision | Sounding board | Contradiction | Voir dire | Myopic Vision Myopic visi | Myopic Vision Myopic vision entails getting the expert to admit to a great amount of time being spent in the investigation of a matter, then selecting an area to highlight about which the expert is unsure or has not done much work. This area might not be central to the issues in the case, but it must be relevant to the conclusions reached. Then the opposing counsel will make a large issue of it and prove that the expert’s vision is myopic in that the work was limited in extent or scope and, as such, substandard. At the same time, the matter of fees could be drawn in to show that large sums were expended to have this “obviously incomplete” work done. |
