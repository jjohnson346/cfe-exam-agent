THE REASONABLENESS STANDARD  
Workplace searches by government employers are subject to the reasonableness standard in 
two circumstances:  
• For noninvestigatory, work-related purposes, which are wholly unrelated to illegal 
conduct (such as retrieving a file from someone’s desk) 
• For investigations of work-related misconduct 
 
When a public employer conducts an investigation of work-related misconduct, and when

that investigation necessitates a search of an employee’s workspace, the employer is not 
generally required to obtain a warrant to perform the search, nor is the employer required to 
make a showing of probable cause that the suspect has committed a crime. This does not 
mean, however, that there are no restrictions on the employer’s ability to conduct the search; 
it still must meet the test for “reasonableness under all the circumstances.”  
 
There is a two-part test to determine if a workplace search is reasonable:  
• The search must be justified at its inception 
• The search must be conducted in a way that is reasonably related in scope to the 
circumstances that justified the interference in the first place 
 
A search is justified at its inception if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the 
search will turn up evidence that the employee is guilty of work-related misconduct, or if the 
search is necessary for a noninvestigatory purpose such as to retrieve a file. A search is not 
justified at its inception simply because an employer thinks that the suspect might be 
engaged in workplace misconduct. The employer must be able to demonstrate a reasonable, 
clear suspicion, based on factual information, that the area to be searched contains evidence 
of misconduct.  
 
The second part of the test requires that the search be reasonable in scope. The fact that a 
search is justified at its inception does not give the employer carte blanche  authority to intrude 
upon the suspect’s privacy in all areas. The search must be no broader than is necessary to 
serve the organization’s legitimate, work-related purposes.
