Searching an Employee's Mail 
An employer may not conduct searches of an employee’s mail before it has been delivered. 
Under federal law, any person who takes a letter, postcard, or package from the mail before 
it has been delivered to the person to whom it was directed, with design to obstruct the 
correspondence, faces up to five years imprisonment, a fine, or both. See 18 U.S.C. § 1702. 
Once the mail has been delivered, however, then ordinary rules regarding searches apply.
