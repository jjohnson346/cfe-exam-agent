Privacy Act of 1974 
The Privacy Act of 1974 establishes a code of information practices that regulates the 
collection, maintenance, consumption, and diffusion of personally identifiable information 
Law  Individual Rights During Examinations 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.439 
that is maintained by federal agencies. It restricts information about individuals, both 
employees and nonemployees, and it applies to government agencies and government 
contractors running a system of records on behalf of the government. The Privacy Act 
prohibits an agency from disclosing such information without the written consent of the 
subject individual. 
 
An agency, for example, might maintain records about a person containing information that 
is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency. This information might 
include a person’s education, finances, medical history, criminal history, employment history, 
and identifying information (fingerprint, voiceprint, or photograph). An agency employee 
might have access to the information unless it is investigatory material compiled for law 
enforcement purposes, statistical records, or material compiled solely for determining 
suitability, eligibility, or qualification for federal service or promotion.
