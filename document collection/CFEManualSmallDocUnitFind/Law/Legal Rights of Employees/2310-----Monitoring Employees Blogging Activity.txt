Monitoring Employees’ Blogging Activity 
Because the blogging trend is growing, it is important for employers and employees to 
understand their rights and obligations with respect to such online activity. As a general rule, 
employers can monitor employee blogging because employees have a limited expectation of 
privacy with respect to their blog posts, which are posted publicly. However, the extent of an 
employer’s rights to monitor largely depend on whether the employee blogged while on-duty 
using the employer’s computer system.  
 
Individual Rights During Examinations Law 
2.430  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Employees have no reasonable expectation of privacy when blogging on the employer’s 
system because the system was set up to provide business communications. If there is no 
reasonable expectation of privacy, then there is no constitutional or common law restriction 
on monitoring such activity. Therefore, an employee who uses an employer’s system to blog 
about violating company policy or illegal activity, or who engages in other unacceptable 
conduct, can generally be disciplined for such posts. However, employers should formalize 
their computer/Internet use policies to cover blogging and to effectively maintain control 
over such use.  
 
Concerning an employee’s off-duty blogging, employers should carefully examine the legal 
consequences of using such conduct when discharging or disciplining an employee, including 
those that are at will, because such action implicates state and federal law. In fact, some 
states (California, New York, Colorado, Montana, and North Dakota) enacted laws that limit 
an employer’s power to discharge an employee for off-duty conduct. Furthermore, an 
employee who blogs about certain topics related to status in a protected class may also be 
protected from discharge (i.e., when employee reveals personal information about his 
disability or religious beliefs, or writes about harassment or discrimination in the workplace). 
Therefore, companies should enact and apply Internet-use policies consistently and 
uniformly.
