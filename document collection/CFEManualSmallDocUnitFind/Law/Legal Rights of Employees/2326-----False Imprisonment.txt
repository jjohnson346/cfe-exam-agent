False Imprisonment 
Again, false imprisonment is the restraint by one person of the physical liberty of another 
without consent or legal justification. A claim of false imprisonment might be made if an 
employee is detained in any way during a search, either of the employee himself or of the 
employee’s desk, locker, and so on. For more information on false imprisonment, see the 
Interviews section in this chapter.
