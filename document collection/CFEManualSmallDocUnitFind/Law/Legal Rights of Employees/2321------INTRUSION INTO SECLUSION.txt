INTRUSION INTO SECLUSION 
Intrusion upon seclusion is the cause of action that is most frequently raised with regard to 
workplace searches. As stated before, intrusion upon seclusion occurs when an individual 
intentionally intrudes “upon the solitude or secl usion of another or his private affairs or 
concerns” and “the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.” Thus, 
where there is an expectation of privacy on the part of the employee, a search without cause 
might give rise to a claim of invasion of privacy. The mere gathering of information is not a 
tort; however, the gathering of confidential information where the intrusion is unreasonable 
might be a tort. There is no invasion of privacy if the information is open to public view or 
has been disclosed to others. 
 
As with constitutional actions, an intrusion upon seclusion claim can be based not only on 
physical intrusions, but also on wiretapping, eavesdropping and other forms of surveillance. 
 
An employer can eliminate the potential for claim of invasion of privacy by publishing and 
following a “search” policy. In addition, the following measures can be taken: 
• Having a written policy regarding searches, surveillance, and telephone monitoring 
• Retaining a key to all desks, lockers, etc. 
• Requiring employees to provide keys to all personal locks 
• Obtaining consent to search
