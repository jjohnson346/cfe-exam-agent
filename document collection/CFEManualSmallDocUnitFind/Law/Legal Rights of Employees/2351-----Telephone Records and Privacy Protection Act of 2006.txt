Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006 
The Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006 (TRPPA) also criminalizes 
pretexting. In 2006, pretexting garnered much criticism after Hewlett-Packard admitted that 
to uncover board room leaks, its investigators obtained phone records of journalists and 
board members through pretexting. Within four months of the scandal’s public release, 
President Bush signed the TRPPA into law. 
 
Specifically, the TRPPA criminalizes the practice of obtaining and attempting to obtain, sell, 
or buy confidential phone records through the use of false statements, unless otherwise 
permitted by law. Violations of the Act are criminal, and, if convicted, a violator faces up to 
10 years in prison and up to $100,000 in fines. These fines and prison terms may be 
increased in case of violation compounded with other activities, or some egregious crimes. 
 
Before engaging in any type of pretexting activity, investigators should consult with an 
attorney to determine whether the information sought is protected by state or federal law, as 
well as whether the planned impersonation method is legally acceptable.
