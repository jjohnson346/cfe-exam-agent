Effect of Violation of Employee’s Rights 
Illegally seized evidence will be excluded in criminal proceedings. A public employer cannot 
use illegally seized evidence to discipline an employee. There is no Fourth Amendment 
prohibition against a private employer using illegally seized evidence to discipline an 
employee; however, the employer might be exposing itself to litigation for invasion of 
privacy, trespass, or other common law causes of action described below.
