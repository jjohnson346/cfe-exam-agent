Breach of Implied Contract 
Even if there is no express employment contract between an employer and employee, many 
states recognize that an implied contract may be created under certain circumstances. An 
implied contract arises out of the conduct of the parties, even without any formal written or 
oral agreement. If a court finds that an implied contract exists, then the employee who is a 
party to the contract can usually only be fired for good cause.  
 
Implied contracts can be found to exist even when the employer was not aware that there 
was a contract. In fact, many states now recognize that an implied contract between 
employers and employees can arise out of employee handbooks. Handbook provisions 
might limit the right to discharge for “just cause,” and the issue might be whether the 
employer has enough evidence of wrongdoing to constitute “just cause.”
