Presence of Corporate Attorney 
Although Miranda warnings might not be required, a company’s attorney may conduct or be 
present during the interview of company employees. Because the company’s lawyer 
represents only the interests of the company and not those of the individual employee, an 
employee who is being interviewed must not be permitted — or misled — to believe that the 
company’s lawyer represents his interests during an interview. For this reason, if a corporate 
attorney is present during the interview, it is good policy to inform the employee of several 
things before the interview begins. Counsel should inform the employee of the following: 
Law  Individual Rights During Examinations 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.409 
• Counsel represents the company, not the employee. 
• The purpose of the interview is to obtain information to provide legal advice to the 
company. 
• Information provided by the employee initially will be treated as confidential, but the 
company ultimately will determine whether to disclose the information to law 
enforcement agencies. 
• The employee is expected to answer the questions fully and truthfully. 
 
The employee should not discuss the interview with anyone (either inside or outside the 
company) except his attorney. 
 
Depending on the circumstances, the attorney might also wish to advise the employee that 
he is free to retain an attorney. Factors to include in determining whether to give such advice 
include the degree of evidence of the employee’s culpability, whether the evidence is such to 
draw a conclusion concerning a violation of the law, the likelihood of criminal prosecution if 
the results of the investigation are disclosed, the existence of a conflict of interest between 
the employee and the company, and state ethical codes.
