State Constitutions and Statutes 
Most states have enacted  constitutional provisions similar to the Fourth Amendment, and 
many of the same issues arise under the state constitutions as under the federal Constitution. 
In most states, standards similar to those applied under the federal Constitution apply. Most 
states have enacted laws governing an employee’s right to privacy in the workplace. Many 
states have enacted statutes that restrict surveillance, including wiretapping or electronic 
surveillance, cameras, pen registers, two-way mirrors, or surveillance in particular areas, such 
as locker rooms, lounges, and rest areas.
