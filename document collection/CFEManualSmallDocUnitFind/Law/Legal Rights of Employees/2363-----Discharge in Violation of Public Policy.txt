Discharge in Violation of Public Policy 
Some states recognize a public policy exception to at-will employment. Under this exception, 
an employer does not have the right to discharge an at-will employee if it contravenes a 
fundamental public policy. To qualify under this exception, the employee must prove that 
his conduct is favored by a relevant public policy and that the employer retaliated against 
him for engaging in this “protected” activity. Agai n, to counter this claim, the employer will 
need to show that it had good cause to fire the employee and that it was not retaliating 
against the employee because of the protected conduct. 
 
For example, if an employee is fired because he supported a particular political candidate in 
the last election, a court or jury might find that his termination is in violation of the general 
public policy allowing people to vote for whomever they please. But if the employee was 
conducting fund-raising activities on company time, the company would likely have good 
cause to terminate the employee and such termination would not be in retaliation of the 
employee’s support of a particular candidate.
