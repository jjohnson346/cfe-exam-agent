Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB) was passed in 1999, and the rules implementing the 
Act became final in 2001. GLB was originally enacted to allow banks and other companies 
to offer previously forbidden services, such as insurance and securities brokerage services. 
Congress was worried that these “super banks” would share customers’ financial data with 
affiliates and other companies to hawk their new products. Therefore, Congress added a 
provision requiring a “financial intuition” to tell customers about its privacy policy, to notify 
them of private information the institution intends to share, and to give customers the 
chance to block such information-sharing. 
 
To implement the law, Congress ordered regulators to define financial institution in the 
broadest possible terms. Thus, financial institutions include not just banks, but also insurance 
companies, accountants, tax preparation and real estate settlement services, and investment 
advisors. The text of the rule can be found at 16 C.F.R. Part 313.1. Additional information 
about the rule can be found at the Federal Trade Commission’s website: www.ftc.gov. 
 
The problem for fraud examiners is that the privacy rules implemented as part of GLB have 
been interpreted to prevent the selling of credit header information. Under the FTC’s 
interpretation of the rule, credit header information cannot be sold except for the very 
limited purposes allowed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The agency reached this 
decision by concluding that such basic personal information, such as names and addresses, is 
“financial” information and therefore must be protected under GLB. Unfortunately, this 
prevents credit bureaus from selling credit header information (including names, addresses, 
phone numbers, and Social Security numbers) to private investigators, direct marketers, or 
other information brokers. 
 
GLB also made it a criminal offense to engage in “pretexting,” (i.e., the practice of obtaining 
or attempting to obtain, sell, or buy private information through the use of false pretenses). 
Some individuals used pretexting as a means to gather financial information about a subject. 
Pretexters would contact a financial institution and pretend to be the customer or someone 
else authorized to obtain financial information, thereby tricking the financial institution into 
providing information about the subject. 
 
Section 6821 of Title 15, U.S. Code, (added by GLB) makes it an offense to: 
• Use false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or documents to get customer information 
from a financial institution or directly from a customer of a financial institution

Violators can, under certain circumstances, be fined and/or imprisoned up to 10 years.
