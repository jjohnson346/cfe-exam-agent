CONSENT EXCEPTION 
The ECPA allows an entity to intercept an electronic communication if that entity is a party 
to the communication, or if one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent 
to the interception.  
 
For an employer to monitor an employee under this exception, the employee must expressly 
consent to the monitoring. Generally, employers must obtain written consent (e.g., an 
employer provides its employees with a written policy explaining that phone calls may be 
monitored and the employees sign the policy). It is important to note that providing a 
notification that employees might be monitored (as opposed to being notified that the phone 
calls or e-mail will be monitored) may not satisfy the consent exception. For example, in one 
case, notification to an employee that her phone calls might be monitored was not enough to 
establish that she consented to the recording of her phone calls. Even when an employee 
consents to monitoring, this does not give the employer unlimited access to the employee’s 
communications. Monitoring still should be c onducted only for legitimate business purposes 
and should be no more broad than necessary.
