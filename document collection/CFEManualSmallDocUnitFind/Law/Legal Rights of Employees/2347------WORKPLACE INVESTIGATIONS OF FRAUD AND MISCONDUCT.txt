WORKPLACE INVESTIGATIONS OF FRAUD AND MISCONDUCT 
Furthermore, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 amended the FCRA to 
exempt certain reports involving employee misconduct investigations. As a result of these 
amendments, an employer who uses a third party to conduct a workplace investigation no 
longer has to obtain the prior consent of an employee if the investigation involves suspected: 
• Misconduct 
• Violation of law or regulations 
• Violation of any pre-existing policy of the employer 
 
To qualify for this exception, the report from the third party must not be communicated to 
anyone other than the employer, an agent of the employer, or the government.

If, however, adverse action is taken against the employee based on the results of the 
investigation, the FCRA still requires that the employer provide the employee with a 
summary of the report. Adverse action is broadly defined as any employment decision that 
adversely affects the employee. The summary must “contain the nature and substance of the 
communication upon which the adverse action is based.” However, it does not have to 
identify the individuals interviewed or the sources of the information.
