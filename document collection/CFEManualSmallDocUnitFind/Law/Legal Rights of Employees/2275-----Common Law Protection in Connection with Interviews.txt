Common Law Protection in Connection with Interviews  
Even though employees of private organizations do not, in most cases, enjoy constitutional 
protections in connection with interviews, they do have certain protections that arise out of 
common law. These protections also apply to employees of public organizations. Fraud 
examiners must be aware of the relevant common-law protections that relate to internal 
interviews and must be careful not to expose themselves to legal liability.
