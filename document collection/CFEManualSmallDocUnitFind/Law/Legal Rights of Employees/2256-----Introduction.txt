Introduction 
Interviews, and especially admission-seeking interviews, may expose the company and the 
fraud examiner to certain legal risks. Thus, before engaging in an interview, the examiner 
must understand the ramifications of their actions, which requires an understanding of 
certain legal issues and how they limit or affect the ways in which an interview may be 
conducted. The following is an overview of some of the most common legal issues that may 
affect interview situations.   
 
And since employee rights vary from case to case, fraud examiners should always consult 
with an attorney regarding the specific laws and regulations for their state or locality.
