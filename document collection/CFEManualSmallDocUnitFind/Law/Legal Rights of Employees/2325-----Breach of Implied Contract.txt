Breach of Implied Contract 
As noted above, many states now recognize an implied contract between employers and 
employees arising out of employee handbooks or oral promises. For example, an employer 
with an employee handbook containing provisions relating to searches or employee 
expectations of privacy might find itself contractually bound by those provisions and in 
breach of contract if the provisions are not followed to the letter.
