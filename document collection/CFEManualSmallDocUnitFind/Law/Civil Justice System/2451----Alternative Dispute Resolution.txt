Alternative Dispute Resolution 
A current trend in civil litigation is to allow or encourage parties to an action to resolve their 
disputes without the necessity of a trial. Alternative dispute resolution  is the term used to refer to 
these processes.  
 
Alternative dispute resolution has certain advantages over litigation. It helps preserve 
existing business relations between the parties, it provides more flexible remedies, and often, 
but not always, it is less costly. 
 
Alternative dispute resolution usually involves one of two types of methods: mediation or 
arbitration.
