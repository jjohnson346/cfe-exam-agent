The commencement of litigation creates a discovery-related obligation on the parties to 
preserve relevant information whenever litigation is reasonably anticipated. And although the 
duty to preserve is not unique to ESI, electronic information is often difficult to preserve

because of its volatile nature. Also, parties who fail to properly preserve evidence (spoliation) 
may be subject to adverse consequences. Thus, it is important to consider the basic 
characteristics of the obligation to preserve information and examine the relevant 
obligations, especially those concerning the preservation of ESI.  
 
To avoid any adverse consequences, companies should establish policies and procedures 
governing the maintenance, storage, and production of ESI.
