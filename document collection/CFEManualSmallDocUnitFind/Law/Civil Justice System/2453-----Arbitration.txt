Arbitration 
Arbitration is the process whereby a dispute is submitted to an impartial third-person (known 
as an arbitrator) who then decides the outcome of the case (i.e., which party should win). 
The arbitrator acts as a judge or jury by deciding the case on its merits. Arbitration can be 
either “binding” or “nonbinding.” If the arbitration is binding, then the decision of the 
arbitrator is final, and the parties cannot later submit their dispute to a judge or jury for

determination. Conversely, if the arbitration is non-binding, the arbitrator’s determination is 
not binding upon the parties. 
 
Today, many contracts contain arbitration clauses providing that if a dispute arises between 
the parties to the contract, both parties agree to submit their claims to binding arbitration 
rather than filing suit.
