INADVERTENT PRODUCTION OF PRIVILEGED ESI 
FRCP 26 provides that if a party has inadvertently produced ESI that is later determined to 
be privileged, the receiving party must destroy and refrain from using any protected 
information until any dispute is resolved. This rule recognizes that reviewing large volumes 
of ESI for attorney-client privileged material is generally more costly and time consuming 
than traditional document recovery. This rule, however, does not provide guidance for 
determining whether or not producing the material waives the privilege.  
 
On September 19, 2008, President Bush signed into law a bill adding Evidence Rule 502 to 
the Federal Rules of Evidence. This rule protects against the inadvertent waiver of the 
attorney-client privilege or the work product protection. See the “Basic Principles of 
Evidence” chapter below for further discussion of this rule.
