Physical and Mental Examinations 
Either side of a dispute can request a physical or mental examination of a party to the suit. The 
person’s condition must be “in controversy” and shown to be pertinent to the proceedings. 
The request is made “on motion for good cause” and the examination performed by 
qualified personnel. It may seem unthinkable that a defendant would plead insanity to a 
fraud charge, but mental and physical instability can be part of a defendant’s argument for 
mitigating circumstances. The physical or mental health of a defendant also may come into 
play if the defendant files a counterclaim alleging mental anguish as the result of an improper 
search, wrongful termination, invasion of privacy, and so on.
