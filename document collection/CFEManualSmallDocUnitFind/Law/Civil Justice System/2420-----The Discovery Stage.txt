The Discovery Stage 
If the legal hurdles required to begin a civil action are overcome, the case enters the 
discovery stage. To review, discovery refers to the formal process whereby the parties collect 
evidence and learn the details of the opposing case. Under federal rules, either party may 
take discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter of 
the action, or that might lead to admissible evidence.  
 
Discovery can be an extremely expensive and time-consuming process, often taking years to 
complete, particularly in complex litigation such as fraud actions. Proposals to reform and 
streamline the system are constantly advocated, but seldom adopted, in large measure 
because trial lawyers are unwilling to give up or to limit their opportunities to learn about 
and look for weaknesses in their opponent’s case. 
 
Due to the growth of documents in electronic formats, coupled with the difficulty courts 
have had in determining how electronic documents should be introduced as evidence, 
Law  The Civil Justice System 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.603 
several discovery rules in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) were amended in 
2006 to acknowledge electronic information as a necessary component of discoverable 
evidence. Whereas the FRCP once used the term data compilations to refer to electronic 
evidence, the 2006 amendments replaced this term with electronically stored information  (ESI). 
The rules apply to parties in any civil dispute in federal court; however, many states will 
adopt or have adopted similar changes. 
 
The principal means of discovery, whether traditional paper document discovery or 
electronic discovery, include: prediscovery  disclosures, pre-trial conferences, oral 
depositions, written interrogatories, requests to produce documents, request for admission, 
request a physical or mental examination, and requests for inspection of property.
