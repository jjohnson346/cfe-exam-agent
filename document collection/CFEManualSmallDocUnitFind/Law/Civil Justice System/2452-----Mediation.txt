Mediation 
Mediation is the process whereby an impartial third-person assists the parties in reaching a 
resolution of the dispute. The mediator does not decide who should win, but instead works 
with the parties to reach a mutually agreeable settlement. Any agreement will be enforced as 
a contract.
