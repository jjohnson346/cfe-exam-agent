Pre-trial Conferences 
As amended in 2006, FRCP 26(f) requires parties to attend a discovery planning conference 
(called a pre-trial conference) to discuss certain issues, such as the form in which the parties 
want electronic information to be produced. Prior to the amendment, parties could  discuss 
electronic discovery issues, whereas now they must.  
 
After attending their discovery planning conference, the parties are to develop a discovery 
report (Form 35 report), which sets forth a description of how disclosure or discovery of 
electronic information should be handled.  
 
The court will enter a scheduling order after receiving a Form 35 report from the parties. 
Among other things, the scheduling order sets forth the time limits for completing 
discovery. The amendments provide that federal courts may also include “provisions for 
disclosure or discovery of electronically stored information” as an item in its scheduling 
order. Consequently, failure to abide by a discovery report or scheduling order might result 
in sanctions, and possibly criminal charges against the parties.
