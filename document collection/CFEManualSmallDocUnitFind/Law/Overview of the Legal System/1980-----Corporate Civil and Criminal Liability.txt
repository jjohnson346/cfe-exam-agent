Corporate Civil and Criminal Liability 
At the federal level and in many states corporate civil and criminal liability is vicarious liability 
(the absolute liability of one party for the misconduct of another party) that is imposed under 
the doctrine of respondeat superior. Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, a corporation is 
liable for the acts of their employees if those acts occur within the scope of employment and 
with some intent to benefit the corporation.  
 
The doctrine of respondeat superior is very broad and will in fact impose liability on a 
corporation even if those in management had no knowledge or participation in the underlying 
criminal events. Moreover, the acts of any em ployee, from the lowest clerk to the CEO, can 
impute liability upon a corporation, and a corporation may be liable for the acts of its 
employees that violate security laws, banking laws, anti-bribery laws, and many others. 
 
In addition, there is no due diligence defense to a federal criminal charge, meaning that it

does not matter that a corporation had reasonable and effective policies in place to prevent an 
employee from committing the illegal act. However, some states allow management’s due 
diligence as a good-faith affirmative defense to corporate criminal liability.
