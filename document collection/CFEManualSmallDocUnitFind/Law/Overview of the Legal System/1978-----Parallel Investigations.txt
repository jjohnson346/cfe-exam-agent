Parallel Investigations 
Parallel investigations  are simultaneous independent investigations conducted by civil regulatory 
agencies and federal prosecutors that involve substantially the same issues and parties. U.S. v. 
Stringer, 521 F.3d 1189 (9th Cir. 2008) recently addressed the applicable boundaries of lawful 
government conduct while conducting parallel investigations. Although parallel investigations 
are generally permissible, the government may not initiate a civil action solely to obtain 
evidence for its criminal prosecution, and it may not affirmatively mislead defendants to 
conceal the existence of a criminal investigation. Stringer reaffirmed the broad discretion that 
courts afford civil regulatory agencies and federal prosecutors in pursuing parallel 
investigations, ruling that so long as targets are generally aware of the possibility of 
prosecution, the government has no obligation to inform them about a criminal investigation. 
Furthermore, where a regulatory agency initiates a legitimate civil investigation before a 
criminal investigation, federal prosecutors may use and guide the civil investigation to 
facilitate criminal prosecution. Thus, Stringer underscores the possibility that a federal criminal 
investigation may be skulking behind every ongoing civil investigation.
