Inadvertent Waiver 
Moreover, some courts have held that inadvertent disclosure of a single privileged document, 
including digital documents, waives the privilege as to all documents concerning the same 
subject matter. For this reason, special care must also be taken to avoid inadvertent disclosure 
from the use of electronic communications, including e-mail, cell phones, faxes, text 
messages, instant messages, etc. It is clear that the attorney-client privilege extends to 
electronic communications, and it is also clear that a matter voluntarily communicated to a 
third-party who is not an agent of your counsel is not confidential and, therefore, not 
privileged. Thus, when a party chooses to use a form of electronic communication, which is 
vulnerable to interception and inadvertent disclosure, you run the risk that your messages 
might be intercepted by, or disclosed to, an unintended third-party.  
 
To illustrate how easily inadvertent disclosure of electronic communications may occur, 
consider a few ways that an e-mail may unwittingly end up in the hands of an unintended 
third-party. E-mails may be forwarded to additional unintended employees, indicating a lack 
of confidential subject matter; they may be distributed to a large number of persons, 
suggesting a lack of confidentiality; or the sender could mistakenly hit the wrong key on the 
keyboard and send the e-mail to the wrong recipient. Therefore, fraud examiners must be 
concerned about the risks of inadvertent disclosure of electronic communications and should 
take cautionary measures to preserve the attorney-client privilege. 
 
Unfortunately, fear over the consequences of subject-matter waiver has led to dramatic 
litigation cost increases in today’s digital environment, where reviewing tens, hundreds, and 
even thousands of gigabytes of information for privilege is time consuming and expensive.
