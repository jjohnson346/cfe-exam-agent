Objections to Exhibits 
Just because an exhibit is authenticated does not mean it is automatically admitted. If the 
evidence violates some other rule of evidence — such as the rules against hearsay, prejudice, or 
relevance — the exhibit will likely be barred. 
 
If an objection is made, the admissibility of some exhibits require separate hearings for the 
judge to consider the issue. Fraud trials can be bogged down with lengthy challenges to the 
sometimes mountainous stacks of documents offered as evidence. In deciding on the 
admissibility of exhibits, judges can decide to admit the material just as it is, admit it with 
alterations (such as expurgating parts of a text or obscuring certain images), or deny the 
admission altogether.
