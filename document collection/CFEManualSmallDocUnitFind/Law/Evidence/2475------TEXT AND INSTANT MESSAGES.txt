TEXT AND INSTANT MESSAGES 
As the use of text and instant messages continues to grow, parties are offering this ESI as 
evidence in an increasing number of cases. However, given the nature of this type of 
evidence, parties often encounter foundational issues when authenticating text and instant 
messages. Notwithstanding the novel technology involved, these types of ESI can be 
admissible when the proponent offers direct or circumstantial evidence as to its authenticity. 
The most likely authenticate chat room and text messages are: 
• Witness with personal knowledge (e.g., a witness testifies that he recognizes a copy 
messages that he received or drafted) 
• Circumstantial evidence of distinctive characteristics (e.g., the use of the defendant’s name 
in the text messages and the subject matter of the messages)
