Excited Utterances 
There is also an exception for statements relating to a startling event or condition made while 
the declarant was under the stress of its excitement. Unlike statements of present sense 
impressions, excited utterances require an occurrence that is startling enough to produce 
excitement.  In the Mr. Whistler scenario, for example, Moore’s statements might qualify as 
an excited utterance if she discovered the bid sheets after months of searching for 
incriminating evidence and told Whistler, while jumping up and down in excitement, “I’ve 
found the evidence I’ve been waiting for a long time!” Here, the successful conclusion of the 
search was sufficiently exciting.
