Selective Waiver 
Under the selective waiver doctrine, a corporation seeking to cooperate with a government 
investigation, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, can disclose material protected by the 
attorney-client privilege to the government without waiving those protections as to 
nongovernmental parties, such as private plaintiffs. But it should be noted that most federal 
circuit courts have rejected the selective waiver doctrine. In addition, Rule 502 of the Federal 
Rules of Evidence does not explicitly acknowledge selective waiver, but it does not explicitly 
eliminate selective waiver as a viable doctrine.
