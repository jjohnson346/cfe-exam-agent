Business Records and Other Documents 
Business records can encompass a broad range of documents, from all sorts of organizations, 
including corporations, small businesses, nonprofit operations, and community groups. Like 
other evidence, a party offering business records must provide testimony that the exhibit is 
the business record in question. For proper authentication, the party offering the evidence 
should be able to establish the following two things: 
• The content of the document is complete and unaltered 
• The document originated from the named place of origination 
 
Law  Basic Principles of Evidence 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.709 
Certain documents, such as business records, are self-authenticating and may be received into 
evidence without independent proof of authenticity. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, 
business records are self-authenticating if a custodian or other qualified person certifies that 
the records meet the following requirements:  
• The records were prepared reasonably near the time of the event it describes. 
• The records were made by, or based on information transmitted from, a person with 
knowledge 
• The document was prepared as a usual part of doing business (i.e., it was not prepared 
specifically for litigation). 
 
Business records are also vulnerable to hearsay objections. Put differently, offering the 
contents of business records to establish the truth of their contents can constitute hearsay. 
Thus, such materials can be barred as unreliable out-of-court statements unless a trustworthy 
foundation can be established. If, however, there is certification that complies with the self-authenticating 
rules listed above, the records will not only be self-authenticating, but the 
contents of the records will be admissible to the prove the truth of the contents as an 
exception to the rule against hearsay.
