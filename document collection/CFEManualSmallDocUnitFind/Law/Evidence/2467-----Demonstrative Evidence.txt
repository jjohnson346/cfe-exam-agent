Demonstrative Evidence 
Again, demonstrative evidence refers to a tangible item that illustrates some material proposition. 
It differs from real evidence in that demonstrative evidence is not part of the underlying 
event; it is created specifically for the trial. Its purpose is to provide a visual aid for the jury. 
 
An exhibit used for purely “illustrative purposes” is a type of demonstrative evidence. 
Demonstrative evidence includes charts, graphs, and summaries that help to simplify 
complicated evidence for the jury. In complex fraud cases, such evidence is extremely useful, 
but it must be simple and easy to understand.   
Basic Principles of Evidence  Law 
2.708  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Demonstrative evidence is admissible if the court decides that it presents a fair and balanced 
summary or picture of the evidence and is not unduly prejudicial, and if offered for its truth 
value (and not just to illustrate a point), demonstrative evidence must be authenticated to 
show that the evidence is in fact what it is claimed to be.  
 
Also, demonstrative evidence must be made available to the other party, and the court may 
order that the information used to create the exhibit be produced in court.
