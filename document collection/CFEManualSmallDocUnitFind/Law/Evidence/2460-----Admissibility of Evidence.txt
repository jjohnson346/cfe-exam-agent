Admissibility of Evidence 
Questions involving the admissibility of evidence occur when one party objects to another 
party’s offer of evidence. If a judge sustains  an objection, the evidence is not admitted. If, 
however, the judge overrules the objection, the evidence is admitted and can be considered by 
the fact finder.  
 
The admissibility of evidence depends on a wide variety of factors — and, in large part, on the 
discretion of the trial judge.
