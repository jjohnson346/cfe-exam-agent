Present Sense Impressions 
Courts assume statements that are made during or immediately after significant events or 
conditions and that describe or explain the events or conditions are reliable, so present sense 
impressions are admissible. For example, a witness can report that he first suspected fraud at 
Securities Plus by noting that his superior said, “Oh my God! This can’t be happening!” when 
he was informed that there would be an audit. In a similar example, Mr. Whistler notices 
Jenny Moore, a co-worker, in John Smith’s office and overhears her say, “Oh, here are some 
bid sheets in the trash can.” If the government prosecutes Smith for bid rigging, which is 
demonstrated by the bid sheets, Mr. Whistler can testify about Moore’s statement as a present 
sense impression because the words described the scene before her.
