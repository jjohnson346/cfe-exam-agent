Federal Rule of Evidence 502 
In an effort to protect against inadvertent waiver of the attorney-client privilege or the work 
product protection, President Bush signed into law S. 2450, a bill adding Evidence Rule 502 
to the Federal Rules of Evidence. The legislation resolves conflict between courts throughout 
the country on whether an inadvertent production of privileged material results in waiver. 
Simply stated, under Rule 502, an inadvertent disclosure of a privileged communication can 
no longer waive protection for all documents concerning the same subject matter.

Among other things, Rule 502 provides the following protections: 
• If disclosure is made, then the privilege is waived to any other undisclosed information 
only if (1) the waiver is intentional; (2) the other information relates to the same subject 
matter; and (3) “fairness” requires further disclosure (Rule 502(a)).  
• If disclosure is inadvertent, it does not result in waiver when the privilege holder “took 
reasonable steps to prevent disclosure” and “promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the 
error” (Rule 502(b)).  
• If the disclosure was made in a state court proceeding, the disclosure does not waive 
protection in a federal proceeding if one of two conditions is met: (1) the disclosure 
would not have been a waiver under Rule 502; or (2) the disclosure is not a waiver under 
state law (Rule 502(c)).
