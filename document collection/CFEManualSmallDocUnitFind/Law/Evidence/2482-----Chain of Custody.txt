Chain of Custody 
If evidence is subject to change over time, or is susceptible to alteration, the offering party 
may need to establish that the evidence has not been altered or changed from the time it was 
collected through its production in court. This is done by establishing a chain of custody. The 
chain of custody is both a process and a document that memorializes (1) who has had possession 
of an object, and (2) what they have done with it; it is simply a means of establishing that 
there has not been a material change or alteration to a piece of evidence. 
 
Chain of custody issues are paramount issues in any case, affecting every piece of physical 
evidence. When parties present evidence to a court, they must be ready to show that the item 
they are offering is the same item that was seized. When that evidence is not distinctive but 
fungible (e.g., bags of cash, bullet shell casings, or electronic data), the process or system 
which authenticates the item is to maintain a chain of custody. 
Basic Principles of Evidence  Law 
2.716  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
In general, establishing the chain of custody consists of documenting each person who had 
control or custody of the evidence; how and when it was received; how it was maintained or 
stored while in each person’s possession; what changes, if any, it underwent in that person’s 
custody; and how it left that person’s custody.  The end result is a chain of testimony that 
accounts for the movement and location of physical evidence from the time it is obtained to 
the time it is proffered at trial. The goal is to show that access to the evidence was limited to 
those who testified in the chain of custody and thereby demonstrate that the evidence has not 
been materially altered. 
 
Gaps in the chain of custody (e.g., when it is not clear what occurred with a set of records) or 
outright mishandling (e.g., a group of questioned documents was not properly sealed), can 
dishevel a case but not wreck it outright. Courts have found in some cases that even though 
there have been mistakes in the chain of custody, the mistake affects the “weight,” though 
not the “admissibility,” of evidence. That is to say, the evidence will still be allowed into the 
record, but it is accompanied by a forthright description of any improprieties that have 
occurred in the chain of custody. The jury and judge are supposed to consider the 
improprieties when they deliberate, “weighing” the case for guilt or innocence.  
 
In fraud cases, the array of physical evidence, all the paper documents, audio and video 
recordings, and information-processing equipment, such as computers, demands some close 
monitoring in the chain of custody. This is an area of the law which either side — plaintiff or 
defendant — can manipulate to avoid talking about the evidence itself, rambling instead like a 
filibustering senator over “who touched what and when and why that means we will not see 
or discuss the item in question.”  
 
The following are some general guidelines that will help examiners demonstrate the chain of 
custody. They will also help examiners in authenticating obtained evidence: 
• If records are received via mail or courier-receipted delivery (such as FedEx or UPS), 
keep copies of the postmarked envelope or the delivery receipts. 
• If a cover letter is included, make sure you keep it. 
• If the cover letter or transmittal letter includes a list of the documents, check the package 
immediately to ensure all documents are there. If something is missing, make a note in the 
file and notify the sender immediately.  
• If you receive documents in person, create a memo stating the date and time the 
documents were received, who gave you the documents, where that individual obtained 
the documents, and a complete list of the documents received. 
Law  Basic Principles of Evidence 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.717 
• If you obtained the documents yourself from the original source (desk, file cabinet, etc.), 
create a memo describing the date, time, exact location of where the documents were 
found, and a complete list of the documents obtained. 
• Keep the originals of these memos or delivery receipts in the case file and keep a copy 
with the documents (it will be much easier to identify where the documents came from if 
you have the information with the documents). 
 
Additionally, because digital evidence can be easily altered or destroyed, a chain of custody 
must be maintained for all electronic evidence gathered and analyzed in an investigation. ”At 
a minimum, the following chain of custody procedures should be followed: 
• Identify each item that contains relevant information.  
• Document each item, who it was received from, who authorized its removal, the location 
of the item, and the date and time the item was received.  
• Maintain a continuous record of the item’s custody as it changes hands.
