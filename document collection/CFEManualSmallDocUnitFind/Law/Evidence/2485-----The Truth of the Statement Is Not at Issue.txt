The Truth of the Statement Is Not at Issue 
The hearsay rule only applies if the statement is being offered to prove the truth of the matter 
contained in the statement. Therefore, if the statement is offered for some other purpose, it 
technically is not hearsay. Any out-of-court statement can be admitted if it (1) is relevant to 
some aspect of the proceedings and (2) is not offered for the truth of its contents. Such 
statements are most often used to show a person’s knowledge or state of mind at a particular 
time. For instance, a witness will be allowed to testify that she heard the defendant say, “I 
can’t stand this company. They owe me big time.” The statement cannot be used to prove 
that the defendant actually stole from the company; however, it can be admitted to show the 
defendant’s state of mind — that he was disgruntled.
