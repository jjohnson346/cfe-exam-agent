Testifying as an Expert Witness

Myopic Vision 
Myopic vision entails getting the expert to admit to a great amount of time being spent in the 
investigation of a matter, then selecting an area to highlight about which the expert is unsure 
or has not done much work. This area might not be central to the issues in the case, but it 
must be relevant to the conclusions reached. Then the opposing counsel will make a large 
issue of it and prove that the expert’s vision is myopic in that the work was limited in extent 
or scope and, as such, substandard. At the same time, the matter of fees could be drawn in to 
show that large sums were expended to have this “obviously incomplete” work done.
