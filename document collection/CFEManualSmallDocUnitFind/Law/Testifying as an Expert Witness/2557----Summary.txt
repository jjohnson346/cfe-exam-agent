Testifying as an Expert Witness


:


Summary 
In his book Succeeding As an Expert Witness, Harold A. Feder suggests keeping the following in 
mind while you are working on a particular case: 
• Keep an open mind. 
• Do not approach a case with predetermined conclusions as to causation, culpability, fault, 
or damage. 
• Remember that attorneys and clients come to you with facts that might be slanted, either 
accidentally or purposefully. 
• Carefully follow your own well-established investigative steps; develop forms, procedures, 
and processes that will ensure that you do not overlook evidence. 
 
One of the best things you can do is to stay current about new developments in your field. It 
takes a concerted effort to stay on top of changes and advances in any industry, as well as the 
latest forensic investigation methods. To be a successful expert witness in any area of 
accounting, for instance, you must have a thorough knowledge of not only generally accepted 
accounting principles, but also current promulgation. For cases involving credit card fraud, 
you must have a basic understanding of your nation’s electronic banking system. While active 
practice in your field of expertise — in other words, experience — remains your single most 
valuable source of knowledge, other sources abound. 
 
Actions, which maintain and improve your current credentials and make you a better expert 
witness, include: 
• Pursuing continuing education and training opportunities 
• Reading trade journals and publications 
• Joining and participating in professional societies and associations 
• Teaching, lecturing, and holding seminars 
• Attending specialized seminars and workshops 
• Writing for trade journals and publications 
• Taking advanced computer courses

You can practice your oral delivery skills, and hence improve your credibility, by actively 
pursuing public speaking engagements and opportunities.  
 
Similarly, to feel more comfortable on the legal stage, you may wish to visit your local 
courtroom to observe another financial expert giving testimony in similar cases. Cable 
television, especially local government shows and the Court-TV channel, also offer a chance 
to see other experts in action in a variety of situations.
