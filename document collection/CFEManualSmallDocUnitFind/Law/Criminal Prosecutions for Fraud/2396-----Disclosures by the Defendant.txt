Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud

Disclosures by the Defendant 
Prosecution has similar privileges to learn the substance of the defense’s case and the basis 
for the accused person’s not-guilty plea. If the defendant requests disclosure of the 
prosecution’s documents and tangible objects, reports of examinations and tests, and its 
expert witnesses, then the prosecution is correspondingly entitled to disclosure of these 
items from the defense. The prosecution is not, of course, entitled to disclosure of the 
defendant’s work product, nor is it entitled to statements made by prospective witnesses to 
the defendant or his attorneys.
