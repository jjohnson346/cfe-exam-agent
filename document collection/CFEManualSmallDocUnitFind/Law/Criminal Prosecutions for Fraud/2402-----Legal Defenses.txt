Legal Defenses 
A defense is an assertion by a defendant in a criminal or civil suit that seeks to explain away 
guilt or civil liability for damages. The more common defenses include:  
• Alibi 
• Consent 
• De minimis  infraction (trivial) 
• Duress 
• Entrapment 
• Ignorance 
• Mistake 
• Infancy 
• Insanity 
• Necessity 
• Protection of property 
• Self-defense 
• Public duty 
• Legal impossibility 
• Protection of others

A defendant might also raise a defense based on statutes of limitations, proper venue, and 
proper jurisdiction. 
 
In criminal fraud cases where intent is an element of the crime, defense attorneys may 
advance a number of “smoke screen” theories to excuse their clients of guilt (i.e., by alleging 
some inhibiting factor to the formulation of intent). For example, while ignorance of the law 
might be no excuse, it can persuade a jury, particularly if the crime is complex and financial 
in nature (e.g., an income tax evasion case where the net worth method of income 
reconstruction has been utilized). Some types of computerized embezzlements fit this 
category, too, as does bank fraud, securities fraud, and price-fixing conspiracies. In short, 
while ignorance of the law might not be an excuse, it sometimes induces pity or sorrow.  
 
Likewise, a defendant might use innocent mistak e, advanced age, sickness, and illiteracy to 
evoke sympathy, and while they may not work as defenses, they may persuade the judge or 
jury to be lenient in sentencing. 
 
Insanity may be used as a defense—and often is—in crimes of violence. But to make an 
insanity defense, the defendant generally must provide notice of the insanity defense before 
trial.  
 
The defenses that cause prosecutors the most headaches are assertions of poor investigative 
work (e.g., improper arrests, searches, seizures, and interrogations, improper handling and 
documentation of evidence, privacy invasions, and libeling, slandering, and defaming the 
defendant during the investigation). In fraud examinations, a defendant might make 
allegations of sloppy auditing and mishandling of work papers. 
 
Also, the increased use of the undercover approach in criminal investigations has led to an 
increase in the use of entrapment defenses. Entrapment occurs when law enforcement 
officers or government agents induce a person to commit a crime that he is not previously 
disposed to commit. To make this defense, the defendant claims that the peace officer or 
undercover agent solicited, encouraged, or incited the criminal act, and without that 
incitement, the defendant claims that he would not have committed the act.
