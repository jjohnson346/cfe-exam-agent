Appeal 
A convicted individual has the right to appeal the trial court’s decision. The defendant is 
advised of his right to appeal at the sentencing hearing. A notice of appeal must be filed 
within 10 days or, absent a showing of excusable neglect, the right is lost. 
 
Generally, an appeal may be made only for errors of law to which the defendant made timely 
objection at trial or in pre-trial proceedings. The failure to object is said to waive any claims 
of error. The underlying rationale for this rule is that a timely objection permits the trial 
judge to correct any error when it occurs, eliminating the delay and expense of an appeal and 
possible new trial.  
 
Although the general rule provides that a defendant can only appeal errors he objected to 
during trial, very serious errors that are plain, on the record, and affect the defendant’s 
substantial rights may be raised on an appeal even without a timely objection. 
 
An appellate court will reverse a conviction only if it finds error that denied the defendant a 
fair trial. Essentially, an appellate court will not reverse a conviction unless it finds error that 
affected the “substantial rights” of the defendant; “harmless error” that does not affect the 
jury’s decision is tolerated.
