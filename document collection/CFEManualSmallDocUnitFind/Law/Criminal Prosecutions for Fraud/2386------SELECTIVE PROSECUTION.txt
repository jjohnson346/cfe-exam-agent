SELECTIVE PROSECUTION 
When multiple perpetrators are involved in a criminal act, a defendant may claim “selective 
prosecution,” accusing the authorities of targeting some individuals and exonerating others 
without cause. Defendants also may allege “vindictive prosecution.” If, after being 
exonerated on one charge, a person is charged with another, more serious charge, the 
individual may claim vindictive prosecution.
