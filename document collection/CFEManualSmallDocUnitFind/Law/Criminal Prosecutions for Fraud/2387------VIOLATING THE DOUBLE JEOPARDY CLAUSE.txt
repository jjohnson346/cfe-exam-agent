VIOLATING THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY CLAUSE 
The “Double Jeopardy” clause of the Fifth Amendment — which prevents someone from 
being tried for the same crime twice — may be used to request a dismissal. Dismissal motions 
also may claim that the indictment is invalid because it is based on tainted evidence, 
insufficient evidence, or illegally seized evidence.
