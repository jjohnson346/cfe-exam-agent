MULTIPLICITY 
Multiplicity is the opposite of duplicity. Multiplicity occurs when two or more counts charge 
essentially the same offense, thereby exposing the defendant to cumulative punishment for 
one offense. In essence, multiplicity occurs when a defendant is charged twice for the same 
offense, exposing him to double the punishment.
