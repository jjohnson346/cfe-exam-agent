Motion to Suppress Evidence 
A motion to suppress evidence argues that evidence that was improperly obtained, is 
impertinent or unduly prejudicial, or violates some other right, and it asks the court to issue

charges (at least temporarily) for lack of adequate proof. But an unsuccessful suppression 
motion might be followed by renewed interest by the defendant in a plea bargain.
