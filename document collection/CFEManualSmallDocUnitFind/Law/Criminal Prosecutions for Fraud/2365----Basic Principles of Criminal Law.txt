Basic Principles of Criminal Law 
Whereas civil law is that body of law that provides remedies for violations of private rights, 
criminal law deals with offenses of a public nature. A criminal defendant in a federal or state 
court is presumed innocent. He also has the right to remain silent, to confront accusers, to 
be advised by counsel, to have a speedy trial in front of peers, as well as other protections. 
And under the U.S. criminal justice system, the government bears the burden of proving the 
accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and it is expected to scrupulously observe the 
rights of the defendant.  
 
Also, in the criminal system, the government must adhere to the principal guarantees of 
individual rights, which are established by the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. These 
amendments are applied to the states under the “due process” clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment.  
 
The procedures described in this chapter primarily refer to federal rules. Individual state 
procedures might differ.
