Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud

Indictment and Information 
In the federal system, all offenses punishable by death must be charged by indictment; all 
felonies (generally crimes punishable by imprisonment for a year or more) must be 
prosecuted by indictment, unless the defendant waives the requirement, in which case the 
prosecution may proceed by the filing of an “information.” An information is a charge signed 
only by the prosecutor without the involvement of the grand jury. A misdemeanor may be 
charged by either an indictment or information.
