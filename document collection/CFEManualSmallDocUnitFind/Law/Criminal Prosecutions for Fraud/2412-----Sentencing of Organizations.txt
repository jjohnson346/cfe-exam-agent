Sentencing of Organizations 
The sentencing guidelines for organizations were designed to reconcile the wide disparity in 
federal sentencing.  
 
Corporations and other organizations may be criminally liable for offenses committed by 
their agents if committed in the scope of the agent’s duty and with the intended purpose of 
benefiting the organization. 
 
Sentencing guidelines for organizations indicate that: 
• The court must, whenever practicable, order the organization to remedy any harm 
caused by the offense. 
• If the organization operated primarily for a criminal purpose, the fine should be set 
sufficiently high to divest the organization of all assets. 
• The fine range for any other organization should be based on the seriousness of the 
offense and the culpability of the organization. Culpability generally will be determined 
by the steps taken by the organization prior to the offense to prevent and detect criminal 
conduct, the extent of involvement in or tolerance of the offense by the organization’s 
personnel, and the organization’s response after an offense had been committed.
