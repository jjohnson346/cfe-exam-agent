Conflict of Interest 
A conflict of interest occurs when an employee has an undisclosed personal or economic 
interest in a transaction. These schemes involve self-dealing by an employee and can occur in 
various ways. A conflict may occur when an employee accepts inappropriate gifts, favors, or 
kickbacks from vendors, or when an employee engages in unapproved employment 
discussions with current or prospective contractors or suppliers. 
 
Statutes in every state and the federal system (as well as common law decisions in all 
jurisdictions) prohibit people from engaging in conduct that involves a conflict of interest. A 
conflict of interest may be prosecuted civilly or criminally. The criminal statutes vary widely 
and include prohibitions on public officers from accepting employment with government 
contractors or lobbying government agencies during specified times. 
 
Elements of a typical civil claim for conflict of interest include: 
• An agent taking an interest in a transaction

• That is actually or potentially adverse to the principal 
• Without full and timely disclosure to and approval by the principal 
 
An agent includes any person who, under the law, owes a duty of loyalty to another, including 
officers, directors, and employees of a corporation, public officials, trustees, brokers, 
independent contractors, attorneys, and accountants. People who do not occupy positions of 
trust with another party, such as arms-length commercial parties, do not owe a duty of 
loyalty to each other and therefore are not subject to conflict of interest restrictions. 
 
The defendant in a civil conflict of interest case must repay any losses that the conflict 
caused and “disgorge” any profits he earned because of the conflict, even if there was no 
actual loss to the principal. The “disloyal” party also might be required to forfeit all 
compensation received during the period of disloyalty. The victim of a conflict of interest 
also may void any contracts entered into on its behalf that were the result of or influenced by 
the conflict.
