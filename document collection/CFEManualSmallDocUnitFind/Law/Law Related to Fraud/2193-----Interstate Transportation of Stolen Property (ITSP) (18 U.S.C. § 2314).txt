Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property (ITSP) (18 U.S.C. § 2314) 
As noted above, the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property (ITSP) statute prohibits 
the transportation, transmittal, or transfer of fraudulently received goods, wares, 
merchandise, securities, or money in interstate or foreign commerce, when valued at $5,000 
or more. Prosecutors may use the ITSP to prosecute theft of commercial trade secrets, 
proprietary information, or other types of intellectual property in certain situations. 
Generally, if the stolen items in question qualify as goods, wares, or merchandise, the courts 
agree that section 2314 applies when a defendant steals a tangible object that contains 
intellectual property.
