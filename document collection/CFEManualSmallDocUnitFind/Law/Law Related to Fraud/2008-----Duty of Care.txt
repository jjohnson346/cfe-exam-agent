Duty of Care 
A corporate officer, director, or high-level employee, as well as other people in a fiduciary 
relationship, must conduct business affairs prudently with the skill and attention normally 
exercised by people in similar positions. Fiduciaries who act carelessly or recklessly are 
responsible for any resulting loss to the corporate shareholders or other principals. Damages 
may be recovered in a civil action for negligence, mismanagement, or waste of corporate 
assets. 
 
People in a fiduciary relationship, however, are not guarantors against all business reverses or 
errors in judgment. The business judgment rule protects corporate officers and directors from 
liability for judgments that were made in good faith (e.g., free of self-dealings or conflicts) 
and that appeared to be prudent based on the then-known circumstances. 
 
Corporate officers breach their duty of loyalty if they accept kickbacks, engage in a conflict 
of interest, or are otherwise disloyal. However, corporate officers who carelessly fail to 
prevent such conduct, enforce controls, or pursue recovery of losses might breach their duty 
of care. Corporate defendants in such cases might raise the business judgment rule in 
defense by showing that they had no reasonable grounds to suspect such conduct or that the 
cost of prevention or recovery was too high compared to the anticipated returns.
