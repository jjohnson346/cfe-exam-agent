Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)) 
Also, the anti-kickback statute (also referred to in the healthcare industry as the Medicare-Medicaid 
Anti-Fraud and Abuse Statute) may be used to combat healthcare fraud. This 
statute prohibits an individual from making payments to induce the purchase of healthcare 
goods or services that will be paid for by a federal health care program.  
 
A violation of the anti-kickback statute carries criminal fines of up to $25,000 per violation, 
imprisonment for up to five years, and exclusion from participation in federal health care 
programs. The government may also impose civil penalties, which could result in treble 
damages plus $50,000 for each violation.
