IMPROPER INFLUENCE ON AUDITS 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also makes it unlawful for any officer or director of a public 
company to take any action to fraudulently influence, coerce, manipulate, or mislead an 
auditor in the performance of an audit of the company’s financial statements. This is yet 
another attempt by Congress to ensure the independence and objectivity of audits to prevent 
accounting fraud and strengthen investor confidence in the reliability of public company 
financial statements.
