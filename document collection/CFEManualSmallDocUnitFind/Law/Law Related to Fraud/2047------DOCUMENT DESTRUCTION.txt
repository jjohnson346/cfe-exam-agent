DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION   
Sarbanes-Oxley section 802 makes destroying evidence to obstruct an investigation or any 
other matter within the jurisdiction of any U.S. department illegal and punishable by a fine of 
up to $250,000 and up to 20 years in prison.  
 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 802 also specifically requires that accountants who perform audits 
on publicly traded companies maintain all audit or review work papers for a period of five 
years. Violations of this rule may be punished by fines up to $250,000 and up to 10 years in 
jail for individuals, or fines up to $500,000  for corporations. (Although Sarbanes-Oxley  
section 802 only requires work papers to be maintained for five years, keep in mind that 
under Sarbanes-Oxley section 103, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is 
directed to set standards that require public accounting firms to maintain audit work papers 
for seven years. Accounting firms should design their document retention policies 
accordingly.)  
 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 1102 amends section 1512 of the U.S. Code to make it a criminal 
offense to corruptly alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal a record or document with the intent 
to impair its integrity or use in an official proceeding, or to otherwise obstruct, influence, or 
impede any official proceeding or attempt to do so. Violations of this section are punishable 
by fines up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to 20 years.
