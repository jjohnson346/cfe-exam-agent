The Stark Law (42 U.S.C. 1395nn) 
The Stark Law (also known as the physician self-referral law) attempts to limit the ability of 
physicians to profit from their referrals by prohibiting physicians from making referrals of 
certain designated health services (DHS) to entities with which the physician or his 
immediate family member has a financial relationship. The DHS include physical therapy 
services; occupational therapy services; radiology and ultrasound services; durable medical 
equipment and supplies; parental and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies; prosthetics, 
orthotic, and prosthetic devices; home health services and supplies; outpatient prescription 
drugs; and hospital services.  
 
In contrast to the Anti-Kickback Statute, which is a criminal statute that targets a wide range 
of transactions, the Stark Law is a civil law that specifically targets physician referrals. 
 
An individual who violates the Stark Law can incur civil penalties and be excluded from 
participation in federal health care programs.
