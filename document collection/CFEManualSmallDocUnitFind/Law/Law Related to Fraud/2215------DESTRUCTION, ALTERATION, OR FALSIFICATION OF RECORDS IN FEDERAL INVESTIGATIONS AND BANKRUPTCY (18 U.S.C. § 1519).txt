DESTRUCTION, ALTERATION, OR FALSIFICATION OF RECORDS IN FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS AND BANKRUPTCY (18 U.S.C. § 1519) 
Following the Enron scandal, section 1519 of Title 18, U.S. Code, was added to narrow the 
scope of when destruction under a document retention policy must cease. Unlike section 
1512(c), which uses the word corruptly, section 1519 uses the word knowingly.
