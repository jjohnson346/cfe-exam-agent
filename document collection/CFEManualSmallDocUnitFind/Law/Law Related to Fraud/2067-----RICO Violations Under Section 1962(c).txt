RICO Violations Under Section 1962(c) 
Section 1962(c) is probably the most commonly used provision. It makes it an offense for 
any person associated with an “enterprise” that is engaged in interstate commerce to 
participate in the affairs of such an enterprise through a “pattern of racketeering activity.” 
The elements of a section 1962(c) offense are: 
• The defendant was employed by or associated with an “enterprise” as defined in the 
statute, which can be a business, union, a group of individuals “associated in fact,” or 
even a single individual. 
• The enterprise was engaged in or affected interstate commerce. 
• The defendant conducted the affairs of the enterprise through a “pattern of racketeering 
activity,” that is, two or more illegal acts enumerated in the statute as predicate 
violations, such as mail and wire fraud or ITSP violations.
