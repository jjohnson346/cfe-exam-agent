Fraudulent Use of Credit Cards (15 U.S.C. § 1644) 
The federal government uses several different statutes to prosecute credit card fraud, 
including section 1644 of the Truth in Lending Act, the mail fraud statute, and the wire 
fraud statutes. But of these three statutes, only section 1644 is specifically designed to 
combat credit card fraud.   
 
Section 1644 of the Truth in Lending Act provides penalties for the use of counterfeit, 
fictitious, altered, forged, lost, stolen, or fraudulently obtained credit cards. Specifically, 
section 1644 prohibits an individual from using a fraudulently obtained credit card to obtain

prohibits a person from receiving, concealing, using, or transporting anything of value that 
was “obtained with a counterfeit, fictitious, altered, forged, lost, stolen, or fraudulently 
obtained credit card.” A violator can be fined up to $10,000 and/or imprisoned for up to 10 
years.
