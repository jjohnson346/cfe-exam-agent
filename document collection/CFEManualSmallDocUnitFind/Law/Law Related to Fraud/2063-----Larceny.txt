Larceny  
Larceny is defined as the unlawful taking of money or property of another with the intent to 
convert or to deprive the owner. Unlike embezzlement schemes, in larceny schemes, the 
defendant never has lawful possession of the property, but he may have mere custody of it 
(e.g., a cashier has custody, not possession, of money in a register). To establish a violation 
under section 641, the government must prove the following: 
• The defendant fraudulently appropriated money or property of another. 
• The appropriation occurred without the consent of the owner. 
• The defendant intended to convert it to his use. 
• The property at issue belonged to the United States. 
 
However, it is not necessary to prove that the defendant knew that the property belonged to 
the federal government.
