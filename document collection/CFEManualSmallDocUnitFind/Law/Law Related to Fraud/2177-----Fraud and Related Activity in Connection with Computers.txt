Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Computers (18 U.S.C. § 1030) 
Originally enacted in 1986, this section, know n as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, was 
amended by the Computer Abuse Amendments Act of 1994. Most relevant to fraud 
examiners is subsection (a), which prohibits seven acts involving “protected computers.”  
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.311 
A protected computer, under this section, includes: 
• A computer that is used exclusively by a financial institution or the U.S. government 
• Any computer whose use affects a computer used by a financial institution or the federal 
government 
• A computer that is used in interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including 
a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects 
interstate or foreign commerce of the United States 
 
Briefly put, section 1030(a) prohibits using a protected computer: 
• To commit espionage (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(1)) 
• To obtain, without authorization, certain government, financial institution, or 
commercial information (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2)) 
• To access, without authorization, a government computer (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(3)) 
• To commit fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4)) 
• To transmit a program, code, or command to damage a protected computer or to access 
a protected computer that results in damage (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)) 
• For trafficking in passwords (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(6)) 
• To transmit extortionate threats (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(7)) 
 
Section 1030(a)(4) and section 1030(a)(5), are discussed in further detail below. 
 
Federal and state legislatures are moving quickly to make criminal all manner of computer 
fraud and abuses, such as hardware theft and destruction, misappropriation of software, 
unauthorized accessing of computers and data communications facilities to steal data or 
money or to cause mischief. 
 
COMPUTER FRAUD (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4)) 
Section 1030(a)(4) outlaws fraud involving protected computers. There are three elements of 
the crime, which include: 
• Knowingly accessing a protected computer without authorization (or exceeding 
authorization) 
• With the intent to defraud 
• And thereby obtaining anything of value (more than $5,000 over the course of a year) 
 
Furthermore, violations of section 1030(a)(4) may implicate other related federal laws, 
including, but not limited to:

• Wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) 
• Theft of trade secrets (18 U.S.C. § 1832) 
• Fraud involving credit cards and access devices (18 U.S.C. § 1029) 
• False statements on a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency or department (18 U.S.C. § 1001) 
• False statements on federally insured loan and credit applications (18 U.S.C. § 1014) 
• False claims against the United States (18 U.S.C. § 287) 
• Bank fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1344) 
• Theft or embezzlement by officer or employee of lending, credit, and insurance 
institutions (18 U.S.C. § 657) 
• False entries by bank officers or employees (18 U.S.C. § 1005) 
• False entries by officers or employees of federal credit institutions (18 U.S.C. § 1006) 
• Copyright infringement (18 U.S.C. § 2319) 
• Money laundering (18 U.S.C. §§ 1956–1957) 
• Racketeering (18 U.S.C. § 1962) 
 
CAUSING COMPUTER DAMAGE (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)) 
Section 1030(a)(5) outlaws causing computer damage, but it contains two categories of 
offense, depending on intent. The first category provides that it is illegal to knowingly 
transmit a program, code, or command that intentionally causes damage to a protected 
computer. This offense applies even if the individual had authorization to access the 
computer.  
 
The second category provides that it is illegal to access a protected computer, without 
authorization, that results in damage. Unlike the first category, this offense does not require 
intent to damage — only the intent to access the information.  
 
Unlawful actions under the first category of section 1030(a)(5) violations include 
imprisonment up to one year and/or a fine. Violators under the second category of section 
1030(a)(5) may receive up to five years of imprisonment (not more than 10 years for repeat 
offenders) and/or a fine. Both categories provide a civil remedy for any person who suffers 
damage as a result of a violation of section 1030(a)(5).  
 
To apply, section 1030(a)(5) requires that the defendant’s conduct “cause” damage to a 
computer. Due to its broadness, the definition allows section 1030(a)(5) to apply in various 
situations, including instances where an act causes information to be deleted or changed, 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.313 
where an intruder alters the way a computer operates, or where an act makes information 
unavailable. Even if an intruder did not make any alterations and the computer system works 
as it did before, some courts have ruled that accessing and copying private data from 
protected computers may cause damage to the data under section 1035(a)(5). For example, in 
the case of Shurgard Storage v. Safeguard Self Storage, 119 F. Supp. 2d 1121 (W.D. Wash. 2000), a 
U.S. District Court held that the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act could be used against an 
employee who, without permission, copied information from his employer’s computer and 
sent it by e-mail to a company that subsequently employed him.
