COMPOSITION OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandates that each member of a company’s audit committee must 
be a member of its board of directors and must otherwise be “independent.” The term 
“independent” means that the audit committee members can only receive compensation 
from the company for their service on the board of directors, the audit committee, or 
another committee of the board of directors. They cannot be paid by the company for any 
other consulting or advisory work.
