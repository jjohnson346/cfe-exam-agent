18 U.S.C. § 1014. Loan and Credit Applications Generally; Renewals and Discounts; Crop Insurance 
Section 1014 prohibits false statements or reports upon any credit application or related 
document submitted to a federally insured bank or credit institution for purposes of 
influencing such organization’s action in any way.  As with section 1001, the false statements 
must be willful, but they need not have been relied upon or actually deceived the agency for 
a violation to occur.  
 
On May 20, 2009, President Obama signed into law the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery 
Act (FERA), which contains a number of measures intended to combat fraud. Among other 
things, FERA amends section 1014 to include a prohibition of false statements in mortgage 
applications intended to influence any action by a mortgage lending business.  
 
The text of section 1014 provides: 
 
Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or report, or willfully overvalues any land, 
property, or security, for the purp ose of influencing in any way the action of the Farm Credit 
Administration, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, or a company the Corporation reinsures, 
the Secretary of Agriculture acting through the Farmers Home Administration or successor 
agency, the Rural Development Administration or successor agency, any Farm Credit Bank, 
production credit association, agricultural credit association, bank for cooperatives, or any 
division, officer, or employee thereof, or of any regional agricultural credit corporation established 
pursuant to law, or a Federal land bank, a Federal land bank association, a Federal Reserve 
Bank, a small business investment company, as defined in section 103 of the Small Business 
Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 662), or the Small Business Administration in 
connection with any provision of that Act, a Federal credit union, an insured State-chartered 
credit union, any institution the accounts of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, the Office of Thrift Supervision, any Federal home loan bank, the Federal 
Housing Finance Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Resolution Trust 
Corporation, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, or the National Credit Union 
Administration Board, a branch or agency of a foreign bank (as such terms are defined in 
paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978), or an 
organization operating under section 25 or section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, upon any 
application, advance, discount, purchase, purchase agreement, repurchase agreement,
