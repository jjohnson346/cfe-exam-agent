Duty of Loyalty 
The duty of loyalty requires that the employee/agent act solely in the best interest of the 
employer/principal, free of any self-dealing, conflicts of interest, or other abuse of the 
principal for personal advantage. Thus, corporate directors, officers, and employees are

barred from using corporate property or assets for their personal pursuits or taking 
corporate opportunities for themselves. More traditional forms of fraudulent conduct, such 
as embezzlements, thefts, acceptance of kickbacks, and conflicts of interest, also violate the 
duty of loyalty and may be prosecuted as such in addition to or instead of the underlying 
offense. 
 
A breach of duty of loyalty is easier to prove than fraud. The plaintiff does not need to 
prove criminal or fraudulent intent or the other elements of fraud. To prevail, the plaintiff 
must show only that the defendant occupied a position of trust or fiduciary relationship as 
described above, and that the defendant breached that duty to benefit personally.
