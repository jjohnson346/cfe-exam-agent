CIVIL LIABILITY WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 806, which is codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1514A, creates civil liability for 
companies that retaliate against whistleblowers. It should be noted that this provision does 
not provide universal whistleblower protection; it only protects employees of publicly traded 
companies. Section 806 makes it unlawful to fire, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in 
any other manner discriminate against an employee for providing information or aiding in an 
investigation of securities fraud. To trigger section 806 protections, the employee must 
report the suspected misconduct to a federal regulatory or law enforcement agency, a 
member of Congress or a committee of Congress, or a supervisor. Employees are also 
protected against retaliation for filing, testifying in, participating in, or otherwise assisting in a 
proceeding filed, or about to be filed, relating to an alleged violation of securities laws or 
SEC rules. 
 
The whistleblower protections apply even if the company is ultimately found not to have 
committed securities fraud. As long as the employee reasonably believes he is reporting 
conduct that constitutes a violation of various federal securities laws, then he is protected. 
The protections not only cover retaliatory acts by the company, but also by any officer, 
employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of the company.  
 
If a public company is found to have violated Sarbanes-Oxley section 806, the Act provides 
for an award of compensatory damages sufficient to “make the employee whole.” Penalties 
include reinstatement; back pay with interest; and compensation for special damages, 
including litigation costs, expert witness fees, and attorneys’ fees.
