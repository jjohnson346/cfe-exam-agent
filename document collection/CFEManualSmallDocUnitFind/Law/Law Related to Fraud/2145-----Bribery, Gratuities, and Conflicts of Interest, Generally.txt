Bribery, Gratuities, and Conflicts of Interest, Generally (18 U.S.C. §§ 201–208) 
These statutes prohibit a wide variety of activities which can be described generally as 
corruption. Such activities include giving or receiving a bribe or gratuity to or from a public 
official, as well as engaging in a conflict of interest. Section 201 is the principal federal anti-
 corruption statute. It applies to virtually any U.S. official and contains two separate offenses: 
bribery of public officials and illegal gratuities. In relation, section 208 prohibits a federal 
government employee from acting on a matter in which he has a conflict of interest. See the 
“Federal Corruption Statutes” section for more information.
