Computer Crime  
Computer crime is a relatively new and somewhat amorphous term referring to both cases in 
which a computer is the instrument of a crime and those in which it is the object. As the 
instrument, for example, a computer might be used to direct calls in a scheme to sell shares 
in a nonexistent gold mine or might be used to steal funds from a bank account. As the 
object of a crime, the information contained in a computer might be stolen or destroyed. 
(The Financial Transactions section contains further information on computer crime.) 
 
Most computer crimes are prosecuted under traditional fraud, theft, and embezzlement 
statutes, but section 1030 of Title 18, U.S. Code, makes certain computer-related activity a 
specific federal offense.
