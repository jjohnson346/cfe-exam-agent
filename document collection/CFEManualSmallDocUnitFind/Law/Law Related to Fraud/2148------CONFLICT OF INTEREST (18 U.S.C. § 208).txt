CONFLICT OF INTEREST (18 U.S.C. § 208) 
This statute prohibits those situations in which a government employee engages in activities 
that create a conflict between his personal interests and his duty to protect and serve the 
interests of the government. Violations of section 208 can result in civil penalties for the 
government employee (not exceeding $50,000 per violation, as well as two times the amount 
of compensation he received or was offered) and the government contractor (not exceeding 
$500,000 per violation in addition to two times the amount of compensation the contractor 
received or offered). It also imposes criminal penalties (up to five years imprisonment 
and/or a fine).  
 
Anti-Kickback Act of 1986 (41 U.S.C. §§ 51–58) 
The Anti-Kickback Act prohibits government contractors from soliciting, accepting, or 
attempting to solicit or accept any kickbacks in connection with government contracts. The 
Act provides both civil and criminal penalties for violations. Criminal violations can be 
punished by a fine, up to 10 years in prison, or both. Civil penalties up to twice the amount 
of the kickback also may be assessed. Additionally, the United States may offset the amount
