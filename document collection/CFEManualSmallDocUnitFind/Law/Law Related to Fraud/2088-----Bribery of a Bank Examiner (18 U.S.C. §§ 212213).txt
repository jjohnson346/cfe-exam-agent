Bribery of a Bank Examiner (18 U.S.C. §§ 212–213) 
Title 18, U.S. Code, sections 212 and 213 forbid the giving of a loan or gratuity “to any 
examiner or assistant examiner who examines or has authority to examine such bank, 
branch, agency, organization, corporation, association or institution …” The only reported 
case construing these statutes held that the prosecution need not prove that the loan or 
gratuity was given or received with a corrupt or wrongful intent. The strict application of the 
statute has been justified by the public’s need for disinterested bank examiners. It is 
important to note that examiner in this context refers to an individual who is appointed by a 
federal financial institution regulatory agency (which is further defined in the statutory 
language), pursuant to state law, or one who is elected under state law to conduct 
examinations of financial institutions. Thus, the term examiner, in this paragraph, should not 
be confused with a fraud examiner.
