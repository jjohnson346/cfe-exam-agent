ATTEMPT AND CONSPIRACY (18 U.S.C. § 1349) 
The Act amends the fraud provisions of the U.S. Code (Chapter 63) to make “attempt” and 
“conspiracy to commit” offenses subject to the same penalties as the offense itself. This 
applies to mail fraud, wire fraud, securities fraud, bank fraud, and health care fraud. The text 
of the statute provides: 
 
Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense under this chapter [U.S. Code 
Chapter 63] shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the 
commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.
