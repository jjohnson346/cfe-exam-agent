Federal “Whistleblower” Statutes 
There are numerous federal laws protecting whistleblowers or employees from retaliation or 
illegal treatment. This section organizes those whistleblower protection laws, which are more 
applicable to CFEs, under specific industries and various areas of law. Even though every 
state has some form of anti-retaliation legislation protecting whistleblowers, this discussion 
will primarily focus on federal law. Therefore, before taking action under any 
whistleblower/anti-retaliation law, a fraud examiner is always well advised to consult an 
attorney for the law of a specific jurisdiction. 
 
In focusing on federal whistleblower/anti-retaliation laws that are more applicable to CFEs, 
this discussion excludes protection laws concerning asbestos, aviation, environmental and 
nuclear laws, federal grants, maritime law, migrant workers, mining, pipeline safety, railroads, 
and transportation and shipping. In addition, this section organizes the applicable laws under 
the following headings:  
• The Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
• The Whistleblower Protection Act 
• Banking and Financial Institutions 
• Civil Rights Act of 1871 
• Federal Government Contracting  
• Employees and Members of the Armed Forces
