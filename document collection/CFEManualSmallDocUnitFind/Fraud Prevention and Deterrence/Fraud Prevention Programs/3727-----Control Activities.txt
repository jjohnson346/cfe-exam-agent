Control Activities  
Control activities  are the policies and procedures that enforce management’s directives. 
Management should set forth policy and procedure guidelines in a manual that is issued to 
employees. A person or persons should be designated to keep statements of policies 
updated and to make sure they are properly disseminated. All control activities should be 
closely monitored by management, and changes should be made where control failures are 
identified. Consistent with the risk analysis component, when a control failure is identified, 
the risk of additional failures should be considered in redesigning controls.
