Discipline 
Violation of this code can  result in serious consequences for the company, its image, 
credibility, and the confidence of its customers, and can include substantial fines and 
restrictions on future operations, as well as the possibility of fines and prison sentences for 
individual employees. Therefore, it is necessary that the company ensure that there will be no 
violations. Employees should recognize that it is in their best interest, as well as the 
company’s, to follow this code carefully. 
 
The amount of any money involved in a violation might be immaterial in assessing the 
seriousness of a violation since, in some cases, heavy penalties might be assessed against the 
company for a violation involving a relatively small amount of money, or no money. 
 
Disciplinary action should be coordinated with the appropriate Human Resources 
representatives. The overall seriousness of the matter will be considered in setting the 
disciplinary action to be taken against an individual employee. Such action, which might be 
reviewed with the appropriate Human Resources organization, might include: 
• Reprimand 
• Probation 
• Suspension 
• Reduction in salary

• Demotion 
• Combination of the above 
• Dismissal 
 
In addition, individual cases might involve: 
• Reimbursement of losses or damages 
• Referral for criminal prosecution or civil action 
• Combination of the above 
 
Disciplinary action might also be taken against supervisors or executives who condone, 
permit, or have knowledge of illegal or unethical conduct by those reporting to them and do 
not take corrective action. Disciplinary action might also be taken against employees who 
make false statements in connection with investigations of violations of this code.  
 
The company in its sole discretion will determine the disciplinary action appropriate to a 
given matter. The listing of possible actions is informative only and does not bind the 
company to follow any particular disciplinary steps, process, or procedure. 
 
The company’s rules and regulations regarding proper employee conduct will not be waived 
in any respect. Violation is cause for disciplinary action, including dismissal. All employees 
will be held to the standards of conduct described in this booklet. 
 
The company never has and never will authorize any employee to commit an act that 
violates this code or to direct a subordinate to do so. With that understood, it is not possible 
to justify commission of such an act by saying someone directed it in higher management.
