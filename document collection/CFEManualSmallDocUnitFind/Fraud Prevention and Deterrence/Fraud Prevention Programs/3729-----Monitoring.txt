Monitoring 
Monitoring is the process that assesses the quality of a control environment over time. This 
component should include regular evaluations of the entire control system. It also requires 
the ongoing monitoring of day-to-day activities by managers and employees. This may 
involve reviewing the accuracy of financial information, or verifying inventories, supplies, 
equipment, and other organization assets. Finally, organizations should conduct 
independent evaluations of their internal control systems. An effective monitoring system 
should provide for the free flow of upstream communication as discussed under the 
information and communication component.
