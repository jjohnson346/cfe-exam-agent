Origins of Ethics 
There are theories that state that by the time one becomes an adult and enters the work-
 place, a basic code of ethics is already in place. Ethical character is hardwired into the 
personality before or during adolescence. By this theory, if a person did not learn to be 
ethical in childhood, there is a slim chance that he will act ethically as an adult.  
 
An opposing theory holds that operational values that guide behavior are not formed until 
early adulthood and, even after that, they are subject to change. Until one has to make 
serious, binding decisions, it is not necessary to act according to one’s beliefs. By this theory, 
as long as individuals have the capacity to reflect and make value judgments, they can modify 
their personal ethics and change their behavior.

Business ethics programs rely on the validity of the latter theory. With the hope that adult 
behavior can be affected or modified, ethics programs are designed to steer employees in the 
right direction.
