Open-Door Policies 
If employees and others can speak freely, many managers will understand the pressures and 
might be able to eliminate them before they become acute. 
 
EXAMPLE  
The controller of a small frui t-packing company in California stole $112,000 from the 
company. When asked why, he said, “Nobody at the company ever talked to me, especially 
the owners. They were unfair. They talked do wn to me, and they we re rude. They deserve 
everything they got.”
