Confidential Information 
Confidential information includes all information, whether technical, business, financial, or 
otherwise concerning the company, which the company treats as confidential or secret 
and/or which is not available or is not made available publicly. It also includes any private 
information of, or relating to, customer records, fellow employees, other persons or other 
companies, and national security information obtained by virtue of the employee’s position.  
 
Company policy and various laws protect the integrity of the company’s confidential 
information, which must not be divulged except in strict accordance with established 
company policies and procedures. The obligation not to divulge confidential company 
information is in effect even though material might not be specifically identified as 
confidential, and the obligation exists during and continues after employment with  
the company.  
 
A few examples of prohibited conduct are:  
• Selling or otherwise using, divulging, or transmitting confidential company information  
• Using confidential company information to knowingly convert a company business 
opportunity for personal use 
• Using confidential company information to acquire real estate that the employee knows 
is of interest to the company  
• Using, divulging, or transmitting confidential company information in the course of 
outside employment or other relationship, or any succeeding employment or other 
relationship at any time 
• Trading in the company stocks, or the stocks of any company, based on information that 
has not been disclosed to the public or divulging such information to others so that they

might trade in such stock. Insider trading is prohibited by company policy and federal 
and state law. 
 
Employees shall not seek out, accept, or use any confidential company information of or 
from a competitor of the company. In particular, should we hire an employee who 
previously worked for a competitor, we must neither accept nor solicit confidential 
information concerning that competitor from our employee.
