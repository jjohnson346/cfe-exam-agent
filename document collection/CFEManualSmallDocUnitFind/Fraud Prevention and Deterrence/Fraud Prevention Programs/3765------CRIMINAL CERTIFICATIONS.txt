CRIMINAL CERTIFICATIONS 
Under Section 906, all periodic filings with the SEC must be accompanied by a statement 
which certifies that the report fully complies with the SEC’s reporting requirements and that 
the information in the report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition 
and results of operation of the company. This statement must be signed by both the CEO 
and CFO. These certifications are known as  “criminal certifications” because the Act 
imposes criminal penalties for violations of this Section, including fines of up to $1 million 
and imprisonment of up to ten years.
