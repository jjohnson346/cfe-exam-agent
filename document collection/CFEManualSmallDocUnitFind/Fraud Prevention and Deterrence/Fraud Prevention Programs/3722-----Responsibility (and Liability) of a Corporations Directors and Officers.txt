Responsibility (and Liability) of a Corporation’s Directors and Officers 
Although many companies do not realize it, the current legal environment imposes a 
responsibility on companies to ferret out employee misconduct and to deal with any known 
or suspected instances of misconduct with efficient and decisive measures. 
 
First, the doctrine of accountability suggests that officers and directors aware of potentially 
illegal conduct by senior employees may be liable for any recurrence of similar misconduct, and 
may have an obligation to halt and cure any continuing effects of the initial misconduct. 
 
Second, the Corporate Sentencing Guidelines, which are discussed in more detail below, 
provide stiff penalties for corporations that fail to take voluntary action to redress apparent 
misconduct by senior employees. 
 
Third, the Private Securities Litigation Reform  Act of 1995 now requires, as a matter of 
statute, that independent auditors look for, and assess, management’s response to indications 
of fraud or other potential illegality. Where the corporation does not have a history of 
responding to indications of wrongdoing, the auditors may not be able to reach a conclusion 
that the company took appropriate and prompt action in response to indications of fraud.

Fourth, the Delaware Court of Chancery in In re Caremark Internationa l, Inc. Derivative Litigation, 
698 A.2d 959 (Del Ch. 1996), stated that, in its view, a director’s duty of care includes a duty to 
attempt in good faith to ensure corporate information and reporting systems exist. These 
systems must be reasonably designed to provide senior management and the board of directors 
with timely, accurate information that would permit them to reach informed judgments 
concerning the corporation’s compliance with law and its business performance. 
 
The court in Caremark  also stated that the failure to create an adequate compliance system, 
under some circumstances, could render a director liable for losses caused by non-compliance 
with applicable legal standards. Therefore, directors should make sure that their companies 
have a corporate compliance plan in place to detect misconduct and deal with it effectively. 
The directors should then monitor the company’s adherence to the compliance program. 
Doing so will help the corporation avoid fines under the Sentencing Guidelines and help 
prevent individual liability on the part of the directors and officers.
