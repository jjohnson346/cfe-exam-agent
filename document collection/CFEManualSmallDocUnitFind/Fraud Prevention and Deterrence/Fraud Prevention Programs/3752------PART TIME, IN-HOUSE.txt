PART TIME, IN-HOUSE 
These hotlines are assigned to an employee with other duties. An audit or security department 
usually staffs an in-house hotline. When the employee is out, a recorder takes calls. The main 
advantage is cost. The main disadvantage is that the hotline is not staffed full-time, which can 
discourage calls. Also, some people might be reluctant to report to the company.
