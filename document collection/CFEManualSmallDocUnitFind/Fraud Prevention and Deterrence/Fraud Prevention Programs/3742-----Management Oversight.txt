Management Oversight 
It is most common for employees who steal to use the proceeds for lifestyle improvements. 
Some examples include more expensive cars, extravagant vacations, expensive clothing, new 
or remodeled homes, expensive recreational property, and outside investments. Managers 
should be educated to be observant of these signs.  
 
EXAMPLE  
Discovery of a $97,000 embezzlem ent that occurred over a two- year period resulted when 
an observant manager asked the internal auditors  to examine the responsibilities of a seven-
 year veteran of the company. The manager no ticed that this female employee had begun 
wearing designer clothes (and making a big deal about it), and was driving a new BMW.

The manager was also aware of the fact that  this employee had no outside income that 
might explain the upgrade in lifestyle.
