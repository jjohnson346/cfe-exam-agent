X. RESPONSE TO VIOLATIONS 
 
A. It is a policy of (company)  that, if a violation of any applicable law, regulation, or 
standard of conduct relating to the business of the Corporation is detected, the 
Corporation shall take all reasonable steps to respond appropriately to the violation 
and to prevent further similar violations, including any modifications to this 
compliance program. It is the policy of (company)  that if ( company)  learns that any 
statement previously made by ( company)  to any government agency is false or 
incorrect in any material respect, ( company)  shall voluntarily and promptly (after 
appropriate preliminary investigation) report the matter to the government agency. It 
is also the policy of (company)  that if (company)  learns of a violation of any applicable 
law or regulation that is not known to the government agency but is likely to be of 
interest to that agency, (company)  shall voluntarily and promptly (after appropriate 
investigation) report the matter to that agency.

B. Any employee of the Corporation who learns of a violation of the type referred to in 
¶ A shall report it to the Compliance Coor dinator (or designee of the Compliance 
Coordinator). Although it is preferable that any such report be made by an employee 
who identifies himself so that the matter may be investigated promptly and 
thoroughly, an employee may make such a report anonymously. Failure to report 
such a violation known to an employee may, itself, be a basis for disciplinary action. 
 
C. Whenever the Compliance Coordinator receives information regarding a possible 
violation of any applicable law or regulation, the Compliance Coordinator shall take 
appropriate steps to examine information and conduct the investigation necessary to 
determine whether an actual violation has occurred. The Compliance Coordinator 
shall recommend to Management an appropriate course of action, and Management 
shall render a timely decision with respect to such recommendation. The Compliance 
Coordinator shall prepare a memorandum reflecting the information developed, the 
recommendation made, and the Management decision rendered, and this 
memorandum shall promptly be furnished to the Audit Committee of the Board.
