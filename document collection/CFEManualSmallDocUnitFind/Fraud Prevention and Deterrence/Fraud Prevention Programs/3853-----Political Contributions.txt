Political Contributions 
Federal law and many state laws prohibit contributions by corporations to political parties or 
candidates. The term political contributions  includes, in addition to direct cash contributions, 
the donation of property or services, and the purchases of tickets to fundraising events. 
Employees can make direct contributions of their own money, but such contributions are 
not reimbursable. In addition, employees can make contributions to a company-sponsored 
Political Action Committee. 
 
Where corporate political contributions are legal in connection with state, local, or foreign 
elections, such contributions shall be made only from funds allocated for that purpose, and 
with the written approval of the president of the company making the contribution. The 
amounts of contributions made shall be subject to inter-company allocation.
