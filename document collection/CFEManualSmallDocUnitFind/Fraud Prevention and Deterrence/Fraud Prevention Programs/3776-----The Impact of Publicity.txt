The Impact of Publicity 
Many corporate executives are more sensitive to adverse publicity than almost any other 
issue. Certainly, one way to convince management of the logic of fraud prevention is to 
point out that negative publicity, even in small cases, can have a devastating impact on the 
bottom line. This negative impact can be eliminated or reduced by a proactive fraud 
prevention program.  
 
One of the more significant examples of adverse publicity can be demonstrated in the E.F. 
Hutton case. As one might recall, 20 or so executives of E.F. Hutton participated in a kiting 
scheme in the late 1980s. The fraud itself was insignificant to the bottom line, but its 
resulting impact was devastating to E.F. Hutton, which eventually sold out. This situation 
pointedly illustrates that insignificant fraud can have a very significant impact.
