Theory of Anomie 
Strain theories are a branch of the social structure theory. Strain theorists view crime as a direct 
result of the frustration and anger people experience over their inability to achieve the social 
and financial success they desire. The best-known strain theory is Robert Merton’s theory of 
anomie. Robert Merton, a Columbia University sociologist, maintained that the discrepancy 
between what people are indoctrinated into desiring and the ways that are available to them 
to achieve such ends is the cornerstone for explanation of criminal behavior. More 
information about Merton is contained in the “Organizational Crime” chapter. 
 
Merton’s theory of anomie (that is, normlessn ess) was derived from the work of Emile 
Durkheim, a French sociologist who adopted the term in his effort to explain suicide rates 
among different social groups. For Merton, anomie  in the United States was characterized by 
an almost overpowering emphasis on the acquisition of things and on the fact that social 
status and importance is usually measured in terms of money.  
 
People can obtain money and material goods, Merton noted, by conforming—that is, by 
working at jobs and engaging in other legal enterprises that pay off. They can also withdraw 
from the fray, saying that they will not be driven by a desire for goods, but will opt out of 
the game that dominates society. The most withdrawn often tend to be those who employ 
illegal drugs to provide their satisfactions. Then there are the innovators —those who refuse to 
play by the accepted rules of the game, but turn to outlawed methods in order to accomplish 
what society has told them that they must achieve to be acceptable members.
