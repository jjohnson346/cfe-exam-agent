Instrumental Perspective  
According to this theory, people obey the law because they fear punishment. When 
reviewing the incarceration rates in this country, it is not difficult to discern that this is the 
perspective most adhered to by policymakers. 
 
A person of this belief might exceed the speed limit, thinking that the benefit of saved time 
outweighs the risk of the potential speeding ticket. These types are unlikely to rob a bank, 
though, considering that success is doubtful and the penalty is steep. They weigh the pros 
and cons of compliance with the law and act accordingly.
