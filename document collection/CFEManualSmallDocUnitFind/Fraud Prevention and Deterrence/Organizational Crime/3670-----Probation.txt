Probation 
Finally, courts are required to impose probation on offending organizations under the 
following circumstances: 
• To secure payment of restitution, enforcement of a remedial order, or to ensure 
completion of community service 
• To safeguard the organization’s ability to pay a monetary penalty that was not fully paid 
at the time of sentencing 
• When an organization with at least 50 employees did not have an effective program to 
detect and prevent violations of law 
• When the organization was adjudicated within the past five years to have committed 
misconduct similar to any part of the misconduct of the offense in question 
• When a high-level employee was involved in the offense in question and was criminally 
convicted of similar conduct within the past five years 
• When such an order is necessary to ensure changes are made to reduce the likelihood of 
future criminal conduct 
• When the sentence does not include a fine 
• When such an order is necessary in order to accomplish one or more purposes of 
sentencing set forth in 18, U.S.C., § 3553(a)(2)  
 
When the offending organization has committed a felony, probation must run for at least 
one year. In no case may probation run for more than five years. The Guidelines also 
recommend conditions for probation in various circumstances. These conditions include:  
• Publicizing the nature of the offense, the organization’s conviction, the punishment 
imposed, and the steps taken to prevent the recurrence of a similar offense 
• Providing periodic reports to the court of the organization’s financial condition  
and expenses 
• Requiring the organization to submit to examinations of the organization’s business 
records and to interviews of knowledgeable employees 
• Requiring the organization to notify the court upon learning of a material adverse change 
to its financial condition or the commencement of any major legal proceedings, 
including bankruptcy, or any investigation by authorities 
• Requiring periodic payments under the court’s specifications, with priority in the order 
of restitution, fine, and any other monetary sanction 
• Developing a program to avoid violations of law and a schedule to implement it 
• Notifying the organization’s employees and shareholders of its violation and its program 
to avoid and detect violations of law

• Reporting to the court on the organization’s implementation of a program to avoid and 
detect violations of law and disclosing any investigation by authorities 
 
If an offending organization violates its probation, this may result in: 
• Resentencing 
• The terms of probation being extended 
• The imposition of more restrictive conditions
