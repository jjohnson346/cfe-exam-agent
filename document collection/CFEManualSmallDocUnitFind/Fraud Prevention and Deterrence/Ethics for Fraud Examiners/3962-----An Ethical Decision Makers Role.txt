An Ethical Decision Maker’s Role 
While one of the main purposes of ethics is to guide the actions of individual decision 
makers, the role of decision maker does not fully describe a professional person’s entire 
obligation. Each person acts not only as an individual but also as a member of a profession 
and as a member of society. Hence, fraud examiners also are spectators  (observing the 
decisions of colleagues), advisors  (counseling with co-workers), instructors  (teaching students or 
new employees on the job), judges (serving on disciplinary committees), and critics  
(commenting on the ethical decisions of others). All of these roles are important in the 
practice of professional ethics.  
 
In considering general ethics, your primary goal is to arrive at a set of acceptable methods 
for making ethical decisions to fulfill all your roles. Consequently, an understanding of some 
of the general principles of ethics can serve as background in understanding the ethical 
decisions faced by CFEs, as well as the ethical guidelines provided in the Certified Fraud 
Examiner Code of Professional Ethics.
