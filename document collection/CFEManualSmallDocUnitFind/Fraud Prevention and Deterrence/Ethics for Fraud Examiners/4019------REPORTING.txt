Ethics for Fraud Examiners

REPORTING 
Reports of the results of a fraud examination, whether written or verbal, must address all 
relevant aspects of the examination and be accurate, objective, and understandable. 
 
In rendering reports to management, clients, or others, Certified Fraud Examiners shall not 
express judgments on the guilt or innocence of any person or persons, regardless of the 
Certified Fraud Examiner’s opinion of the preponderance of evidence. Certified Fraud 
Examiners must exercise due professional care when expressing other opinions related to an 
examination, such as the likelihood that a fraud has or has not occurred, and whether or not 
internal controls are adequate.

Confidentiality 
Certified Fraud Examiners, during fraud examinations, are often privy to highly sensitive and 
confidential information about organizations and individuals. Certified Fraud Examiners 
must exercise due care so as not to purposefully or inadvertently disclose such information 
except as necessary to conduct the examination as required by law.
