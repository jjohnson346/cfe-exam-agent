Ethics for Fraud Examiners


:


ATTITUDE AND APPEARANCE 
Independence of attitude requires impartiality and fairness in conducting examinations and 
in reaching resulting conclusions and judgments. Certified Fraud Examiners must also be 
sensitive to the appearance of independence so that conclusions and judgments will be 
accepted as impartial by knowledgeable third parties. Certified Fraud Examiners who 
become aware of a situation or relationship that could be perceived to impair independence, 
whether or not actual impairments exist, should inform management immediately and take 
steps to eliminate the perceived impairment, including withdrawing from the examination  
if necessary.
