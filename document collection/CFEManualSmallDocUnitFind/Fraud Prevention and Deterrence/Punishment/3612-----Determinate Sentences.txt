Determinate Sentences 
A determinate sentence is one of a fixed number of years, usually set by the legislature, to be 
served upon conviction of a certain offense. In so-called “flat” determinate sentences, the 
offender must serve the entire time in prison; say five years for a fraud violation. More often 
(though decreasingly so in many jurisdictions) the flat sentence can be reduced, usually by as 
much as one-third, for “good behavior.” This ca rrot is considered important by some prison 
administrators because it offers a reward for conforming to institutional rules beyond the 
avoidance of punishments meted out within the walls, such as solitary confinement.  
 
A variation on the determinate sentencing approach is for the legislature to set a maximum 
term for any given offense and to allow the sentencing judge to exercise discretion to impose 
a time period up to that maximum. Often an accused person will enter a guilty plea during a 
bargaining session with the prosecution which will stipulate that the person will be 
recommended for a sentence less than the maximum (an agreement which judges almost 
invariably endorse) or that the person will be allowed to plead to a lesser offense than the 
more serious one in order to ensure that the sentence will not exceed a certain amount  
of time.
