Pardons 
A person may apply for a pardon that, if granted, releases him from further punishment and 
restores the civil rights that are forfeited upon conviction for a crime, including the right to 
vote, to serve on a jury, or to hold public office. 
 
There are two types of pardons — (l) full and absolute and (2) conditional. Full and absolute 
pardons usually are granted only after conviction and upon a presumptive showing that the 
offender was actually innocent. The full and absolute pardon that Richard Nixon received 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Punishment and the Criminal Justice System

from President Gerald Ford before possible criminal proceedings had begun was a rare 
exception to this rule. 
 
A conditional pardon implies guilt, and for this reason, may be rejected by the person to 
whom it is offered. The grant of a pardon or other clemency is the prerogative of the 
executive branch (the president or state governors) and may not be compelled by the 
petitioner or by the judiciary.
