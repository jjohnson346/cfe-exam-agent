Independence/Objectivity of the People Leading and Conducting the Work  
A good fraud risk assessment can be effectively conducted either by people inside the 
organization or with external resources. However, the people leading and conducting the 
fraud risk assessment need to be independent and objective throughout the assessment 
process. Additionally, they must also be perceived as independent and objective by others.  
 
The people leading and conducting the work should be thoughtful and mindful about any 
personal biases they may have regarding the organization and the people within it, taking 
steps to reduce or eliminate all biases that may affect the fraud risk assessment process. For 
example, if an employee on the fraud risk assessment team had a very bad past experience 
with someone in the accounts payable department, he might allow that experience to affect

his evaluation of the fraud risks related to that area of the business. To compensate for this 
bias, someone else should perform the fraud risk assessment work related to the accounts 
payable department’s activities.  
 
Cultural neutrality is an important aspect of independence and objectivity when leading or 
conducting a fraud risk assessment. Some organizations have very strong corporate cultures 
that can play a big role in influencing the way the people inside of the organization think 
about fraud risk. If people within the organization are leading and conducting the fraud risk 
assessment, they must be able to step outside of the corporate culture to assess and evaluate 
the presence and significance of fraud risks in the business.
