Assume the Risk  
Management may choose to assume the risk if it determines that the probability of 
occurrence and impact of loss are low. Management may decide that it is more cost effective 
to assume the risk than it is to eliminate the asset or exit the activity, buy insurance to 
transfer the risk, or implement countermeasures to mitigate the risk.
