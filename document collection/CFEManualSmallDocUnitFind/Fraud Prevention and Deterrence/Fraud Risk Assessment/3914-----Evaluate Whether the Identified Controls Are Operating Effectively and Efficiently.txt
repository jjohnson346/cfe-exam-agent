Evaluate Whether the Identified Controls Are Operating Effectively and Efficiently  
The fraud risk assessment team must ensure that there are adequate controls in place, that 
the controls are mitigating fraud risk as intended, and that the benefit of the controls exceeds 
the cost. Such an assessment requires: 
• Review of the accounting policies and procedures in place 
• Consideration of the risk of management’s override of controls 
• Interviews with management and employees 
• Observation of control activities 
• Sample testing of controls compliance 
• Review of previous audit reports 
• Review of previous reports on fraud incidents, shrinkage, and unexplained shortages
