Develop Techniques to Determine If Fraud Has Occurred in High-Risk Areas  
Assessing an area as having high fraud risk does not conclusively mean that fraud is 
occurring there. However, the fraud risk assessment is useful in identifying areas to 
proactively investigate to determine whether fraud has in fact occurred. In addition, putting 
activity in high-risk areas under increased scrutiny can deter potential fraudsters by 
increasing their perception of detection.
