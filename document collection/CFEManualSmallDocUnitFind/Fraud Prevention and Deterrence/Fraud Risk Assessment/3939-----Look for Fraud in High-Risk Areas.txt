Look for Fraud in High-Risk Areas 
An internal audit or investigative team within the organization can use the results of the 
fraud risk assessment in identifying high-risk processes or activities and unusual transactions 
that may indicate fraud. This practice can also provide some reassurance if the subsequent 
search for fraud reveals that, despite the assessed risk, fraud does not appear to be occurring 
at that point in time. Management should remember, however, that just because there is no 
evidence that fraud is occurring in the present, the risk that it could occur is not eliminated.
