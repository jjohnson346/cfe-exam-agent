Graphic Report Format  
The first sample report format, shown below, would work well in an organization that uses 
dashboards or tends to be visually oriented. The gauges can be substituted with any type of 
visual representation that the organization uses in the normal course of business. This report 
should be accompanied by a one- or two-page action plan.
