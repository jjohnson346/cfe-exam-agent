Evaluate Which People and Departments Are Most Likely to Commit Fraud and Identify the Methods They Are Likely to Use  
In identifying potential fraud risks, the risk assessment team will have evaluated the 
incentives and pressures on individuals and departments to commit fraud. The team should 
use the information gained in that process to identify the individuals and departments most 
likely to commit fraud and the methods they are likely to use. This knowledge will assist the 
organization in tailoring its fraud risk response, including establishing appropriate 
segregation of duties, proper review and approval chains of authority, and proactive fraud 
auditing procedures.
