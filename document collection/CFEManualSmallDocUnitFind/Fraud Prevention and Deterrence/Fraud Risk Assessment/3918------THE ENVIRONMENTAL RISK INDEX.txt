THE ENVIRONMENTAL RISK INDEX  
The Environmental Risk Index is an assessment of macro-level fraud risk indicators that can 
affect the organization’s vulnerability to fraud. These include factors such as pressures on 
the business, the organization’s system of internal controls, the tone at the top, and the 
overall quality of the mechanisms that the company has in place to prevent and detect fraud.
