Assess the Significance to the Organization of the Fraud Risks  
The fraud risk assessment team should consider qualitative and quantitative factors when 
assessing the fraud risks to the organization. For example, a particular fraud risk that might 
only pose an immaterial direct financial risk to the organization, but that could greatly impact 
its reputation, would be deemed a more significant risk to the organization. 
 
The significance of each potential fraud can be classified as immaterial, significant, or material. 
In assessing the significance of each fraud risk, the fraud risk assessment team should 
consider the following factors: 
• Financial statement and monetary significance 
• Financial condition of the organization 
• Value of the threatened assets 
• Criticality of the threatened assets to the organization 
• Revenue generated by the threatened assets 
• Significance to the organization’s operations, brand value, and reputation 
• Criminal, civil, and regulatory liabilities
