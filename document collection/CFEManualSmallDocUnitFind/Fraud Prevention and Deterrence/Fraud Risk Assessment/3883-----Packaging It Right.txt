People do not easily relate to or embrace things that they don’t understand. Every 
organization has its own vocabulary and preferred methods of communication (i.e., the 
language of the business). The notification and execution of the fraud risk assessment, 
including the reporting of the results, will only be effective if completed in the language of 
the business. For example:

4.808   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
• In a creative organization where decisions are made based on qualitative assessments and 
instinct and where the majority of communication is visual, a quantitative approach to 
assessing fraud risk driven by numbers and calculations would most likely be rejected. 
• In an organization where the business is built and run on quantitative decision-making 
models, a qualitative approach with no quantitative components would most likely 
 be rejected. 
 
Therefore, the assessor must remain mindful of the language used throughout the fraud risk 
assessment. Specifically, he should stay away from technical language that will not resonate 
with people in the business. For example, many people in the business might not easily relate 
to or understand the term cash larceny. If cash larceny is one of the organization’s greatest 
fraud risks, it might be more effective to explain the concept in layman’s terms and describe 
the risk as theft of cash  instead.
