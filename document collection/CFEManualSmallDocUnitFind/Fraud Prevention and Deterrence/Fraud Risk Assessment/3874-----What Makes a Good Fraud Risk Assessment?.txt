What Makes a Good Fraud Risk Assessment?  
A good fraud risk assessment is one that fits within the culture of the organization, is 
sponsored and supported by the right people, encourages everyone to be open in their 
participation, and is generally embraced throughout the business as an important and 
valuable process. Conversely, a fraud risk assessment that is conducted without these 
conditions will have inferior results.
