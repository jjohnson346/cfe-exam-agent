A Good Working Knowledge of the Business  
The individuals leading and conducting the fraud risk assessment need to have a good 
working knowledge of the business. Every organization is unique; even companies that 
appear similar have characteristics that make them — and their fraud risks—different from 
their competitors. Some of those differences can be obvious, while others are more subtle.  
 
To ensure a good working knowledge of the business, the fraud risk assessor must know, at 
a more than superficial level, what the business does and how it operates. He must also have 
an understanding about what makes the organization both similar to and different from 
other companies in related lines of business. 
 
Obtaining information about broad industry fraud risks from external sources can be 
extremely helpful. Such sources include industry news; criminal, civil, and regulatory 
complaints and settlements; and professional organizations, such as the Institute of Internal 
Auditors, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Association of 
Certified Fraud Examiners.
