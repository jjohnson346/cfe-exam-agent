Anonymous Feedback Mechanisms  
In some organizations, anonymous suggestion boxes or similar mechanisms are used to 
encourage and solicit frequent employee feedback. In these companies, information 
pertaining to the fraud risk assessment can be requested in the same way. Additionally, use 
of an anonymous feedback mechanism can also be effective in an environment where people 
are less likely to be open and honest through other methods and techniques.  
 
One approach to effectively using the anonymous feedback technique involves establishing a 
question of the day that is prominently displayed above a collection box. An example 
question is: “If you thought fraud was occurring in the company, would you come forward? 
Why or why not?” 
 
Another approach involves using a table lineup of five to ten opaque boxes, each with a 
statement posted above it. Employees are provided with poker chips in two different colors 
and told that one color indicates “I agree” and one indicates “I disagree.” Employees are 
then encouraged to respond to each statement by putting a corresponding chip in each box 
to indicate their response.
