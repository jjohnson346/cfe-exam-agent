Interviews  
Interviews can be an effective way to conduct a candid one-on-one conversation. The 
usefulness of interviews as a technique will depend on how willing people in the organization 
are to be open and honest in a direct dialogue with the interviewer. The assessor must 
consider whether interviews are commonly and effectively used in the organization to gather 
and elicit information. He should also speak with individuals that have previously conducted 
interviews with employees to glean lessons learned. For each potential interviewee, the 
assessor should gauge how likely and willing he would be to be open and honest—some 
people may be good interview candidates, while others may need to be engaged through a 
different approach.
