What Is a Fraud Risk Assessment?  
Fraud risk assessment  is a process aimed at proactively identifying and addressing an 
organization’s vulnerabilities to internal and external fraud. As every organization is 
different, the fraud risk assessment process is often more an art than a science. What gets 
evaluated and how it gets assessed should be tailored to the organization — there is no one-size-fits-all 
approach. Additionally, organizational fraud risks continually change. It is 
therefore important to think about a fraud risk assessment as an ongoing, continuous 
process, rather than just an activity.  
 
A fraud risk assessment starts with an identification and prioritization of fraud risks that 
exist in the business. The process evolves as the results of that identification and 
prioritization begin to drive education, communication, organizational alignment, and action 
around effectively managing fraud risk and identifying new fraud risks as they emerge.
