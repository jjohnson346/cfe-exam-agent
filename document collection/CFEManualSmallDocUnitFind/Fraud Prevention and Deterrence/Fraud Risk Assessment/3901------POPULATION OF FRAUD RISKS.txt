POPULATION OF FRAUD RISKS  
The fraud risk identification process requires an understanding of the universe of fraud risks 
and the subset of risks that apply to a particular organization. It includes gathering 
information about the business itself, including its business processes, industry, and 
operating environment, as well as all associated potential fraud risks. Such information can 
be obtained from external sources—such as in dustry news outlets; criminal, civil, and 
regulatory complaints and settlements; and professional organizations and associations—and 
from internal sources by interviewing and brainstorming with personnel, reviewing 
complaints on the whistleblower hotline, and performing analytical procedures. 
 
Fraud risks can be classified into three major areas: fraudulent financial reporting, asset 
misappropriation, and corruption. Potential fraud risks to consider in each category are 
discussed below.
