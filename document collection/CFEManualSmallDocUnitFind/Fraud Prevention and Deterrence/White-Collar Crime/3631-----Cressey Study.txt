Cressey Study 
Donald R. Cressey found in a 1953 study of embezzlers that most of those he examined 
“had lived beyond their means for some time before deciding to embezzle.” 6 Crimes extends 
this statement more generally, remarking, “The most interesting fact about the white-collar 
offenders’ aggregate financial status is not the value of their assets but the extent of their 
liabilities.” Offenders often “have the material goods associated with successful people, but 
may barely be holding their financial selves together.” 7 These people have assembled a 
structure of respectability, but it is often built on the sands of debt. The Cressey Study is 
discussed in more detail in the chapter on “Occupational Fraud.”
