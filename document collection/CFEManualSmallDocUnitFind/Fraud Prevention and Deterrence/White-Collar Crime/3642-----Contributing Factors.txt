Contributing Factors 
The authors posit several factors which have contributed to the rising problem of  
economic crime: 
• America’s economy increasingly runs on credit, which often means rising personal debt. 
The offenders in the sample often showed serious discrepancies “between their 
resources and their commitments.” 21  
• New information technologies mean that the opportunity for wrongdoing is growing, 
and many of the techniques are not widely comprehended by businesses or individuals.  
• Government programs distributing large amounts of money make an enticing target  
for defalcations. 
• The importance of credentials in a professionalized society may influence individuals “to 
inflate the credentials, or to make them up when they do not exist.” This tendency 
involves everything from cheating on school entrance exams to falsifying  
credit applications. 
• Most broadly, the authors observe an American culture based on affluence and ever-
 higher levels of success. “The continued pressure of a value system that rewards 
economic affluence or its visible by-products has its effects on the broad middle of 
American society.” 22 Television and advertising in general promise that no one has to 
settle for second best, prompting those who find themselves running behind to fudge 
the difference, crossing ethical and sometimes legal lines.
