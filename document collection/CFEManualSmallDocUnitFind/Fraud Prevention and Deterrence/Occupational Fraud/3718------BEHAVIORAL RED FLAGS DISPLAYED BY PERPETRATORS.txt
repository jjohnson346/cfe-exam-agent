BEHAVIORAL RED FLAGS DISPLAYED BY PERPETRATORS 
While a fraud is ongoing, the perpetrator often displays certain behaviors or characteristics 
that might indicate he has a heightened risk of committing fraud. On their own, these 
behavioral red flags do not prove an individual is engaged in a fraud, but they should raise 
warning signals to the individual’s coworkers and managers, as well as the organization’s 
anti-fraud staff. When these red flags exist alongside other indicators of misconduct, this can 
be a strong clue that something is wrong. As discussed earlier in this report, occupational 
frauds often last for months or years before they are caught, so the ability to detect frauds as 
early as possible can have a big effect in limiting losses. 
 
We presented survey respondents with a list of common behavioral red flags and asked them 
to identify which of these warning signs had been displayed by the perpetrator prior to 
detection of the fraud. As shown in the following chart, the most common red flags 
displayed by perpetrators were living beyond financial means (43% of cases), experiencing 
financial difficulties (36%), excessive control i ssues with regard to their jobs (23%), and an 
unusually close association with vendors or customers (22%). This distribution is very similar

to what we found in our 2008 study. As we continue to track this data in future studies, we 
hope to be able to identify consistent relationships between behavioral warning signs and the 
occurrence of occupational fraud. Ideally, this data will help organizations build better fraud-detection 
programs that incorporate behavioral data, in addition to more standard anti-fraud 
controls. 
 
Behavioral Red Flags Present During Fraud Scheme — Sorted by Frequency 49  
 
We also broke down the distribution of red flags based on the type of fraud. Different forms 
of occupational fraud result from different factors and circumstances, which we would 
expect to show up in the fraudsters’ behavior. As the following chart illustrates, individuals 
who engaged in financial statement frauds were much more likely than other perpetrators to 
exhibit control issues or to be under excessive pressure to perform within their organization. 
Meanwhile, living beyond one’s means and experi encing financial difficulties were not as 
common among financial statement fraudsters as others. This makes sense, because while 
asset misappropriations and corruption schemes are almost always committed to enrich the 
fraudster, in many financial statement schemes, other factors—such as meeting earnings 
                                                 
49 The sum of percentages in this chart exceeds 100% because in many cases perpetrators displayed more than 
one behavioral red flag.

forecasts or hitting budget targets — may be as much of a motivator as personal financial 
gain. An unusually close association with a vendor or customer was noted as a red flag in 
45% of corruption cases, which is not surprising given that most corruption frauds involve 
bribery or some kind of illicit benefit. A “wheeler-dealer” attitude was also more common in 
corruption cases than in other forms of fraud, and 42% of all corruption perpetrators were 
identified as living beyond their means. Among those who misappropriated assets, living 
beyond one’s means and financial difficult ies were the two most common red flags.
