The Perpetrators 
We asked respondents to provide information about the fraud perpetrators in their cases so 
we could better understand how occupational fraud levels and losses are related to 
demographic information such as age, job type, gender, education, and position of authority. 
In cases where there were multiple offenders, the responses relate to the principal 
perpetrator—the person identified by the CFE as the primary culprit in the case. The 
following is a summary of the data we received.
