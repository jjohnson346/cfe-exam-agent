INDUSTRIES OF VICTIM ORGANIZATIONS 
We looked at the industry classification of the organizations victimized by the fraud cases in 
our study. It is important to view this data as a representation of the companies that had 
CFEs investigate internal fraud cases within the last two years, rather than as an indication of 
which industries are more or less likely to be victimized by fraud. However, the following 
tables do draw attention to some differences in the frequency and cost associated with 
occupational frauds among different sectors. For example, the banking and financial services 
industry had the most cases, accounting for more than 16% of the frauds reported to us. The 
period of time covered by our survey — calendar years 2008 and 2009 — was filled with news 
stories of fraud in the banking sector, so this finding is not unexpected. In contrast, the
