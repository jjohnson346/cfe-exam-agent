2008-2009 Integrity Survey 
In January 2009, K PMG released its report on its 2008–2009 Integrity Survey. The results of 
the survey were based on responses from 5,065 U.S. employees, spanning all levels of job 
responsibility, 16 job functions, 13 industry sectors, and 4 thresholds of organizational size. 
According to the results of the survey, nearly three out of four employees (74 percent) 
reported that they have observed misconduct in the workplace in the prior 12-month period, 
with almost half of employees (46 percent) reporting that what they have observed was 
serious misconduct that could cause a “significant  loss of public trust if discovered.” KPMG 
conducted similar surveys in 2000 and 2005; in all three surveys, the reported levels of 
overall misconduct remained largely consistent, with 74 percent in 2005 and 76 percent in 
2000 reporting that they had observed misconduct in the prior year. Similarly, the three 
surveys have revealed consistent levels of serious misconduct, with 50 percent in 2005 and 
49 percent in 2000, characterizing the misconduct they observed as capable of causing a 
“significant loss of public trust if discovered.” Although the level of observed misconduct 
has remained constant, employees reported that the conditions that facilitate management’s 
ability to prevent, detect, and respond to fraud and misconduct within companies is 
improving. Employees who worked in companies with comprehensive ethics and 
compliance programs reported more favorable results across the board than did those who 
work in companies without such programs. For instance, employees who work in companies 
with such programs reported fewer observations of misconduct and higher levels of 
confidence in management’s commitment to integrity.
