Accomplice/Witness Informants 
The accomplice/witness informant is called upon by investigators quite often to provide 
information on criminal activity. The distinction in this category is that if the 
accomplice/witness informant were not feeding information to investigators, he would be 
liable to be prosecuted for the same offense. The accomplice informant is often persuaded 
to “spill the beans” on a co-conspirator in exchange for leniency in the prosecution phase of 
the investigation.
