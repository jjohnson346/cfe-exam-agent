Two-Vehicle Surveillance 
This technique uses two vehicles to follow the subject at different distances on the same 
street, as in the “A-B” method of foot surveillance. This technique can be varied by having 
one vehicle going in the same direction as the subject on a parallel street while receiving 
radio-transmitted directions from the observers directly behind the subject. This technique is 
more flexible because the two vehicles can change places from time to time.
