Electronic Equipment 
Use of electronic surveillance equipment should be considered. For surveillance on foot, 
transmitting and receiving devices can easily be hidden on the person without arousing 
suspicion. Transmitters can be concealed in packages, briefcases, or on the person. Light-
 gathering binoculars and/or metascope equipment for night surveillance should be used if 
necessary. See the Law section of the Fraud Examiners Manual  for a description of legal 
electronic monitoring techniques.
