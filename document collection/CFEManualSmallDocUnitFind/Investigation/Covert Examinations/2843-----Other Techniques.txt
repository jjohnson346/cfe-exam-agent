Other Techniques 
There are other ways to lessen the chance of an observer being made. First, by either pre-
 arrangement or signal, the two or more observers can change places with each other. This is 
commonly referred to as the leap-frog method.  
 
Progressive surveillance is used when extreme caution is necessary. With this technique, the 
subject is followed a certain distance and the surveillance is discontinued and the time noted. 
The next day another observer picks up the subject at the time and place where the 
surveillance was previously discontinued, and again follows the subject for a short distance. 
This continues day after day until the surveillance is completed.
