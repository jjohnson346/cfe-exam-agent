BUSINESS ACCOUNTS 
In addition to the documentation required for opening a personal account, the opening 
documents for a corporate account will include a copy of the corporate resolution 
authorizing the opening of a bank account and possibly the company’s articles of 
incorporation. These documents should indicate who the company’s corporate officers are 
and its date of incorporation.

require the company to provide a doing business as (DBA) registration, fictitious name 
registration, or business registration certificate. Generally, the required documentation
