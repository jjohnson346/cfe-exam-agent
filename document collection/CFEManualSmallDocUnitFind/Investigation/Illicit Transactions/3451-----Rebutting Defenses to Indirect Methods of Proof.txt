Rebutting Defenses to Indirect Methods of Proof 
Circumstantial evidence of excess income is often met with the defense that the extra funds 
came from cash accumulated earlier or from other legitimate sources, such as loans from 
relatives. To rebut these defenses, the fraud examiner must pin down the amount of cash on 
hand at the beginning of the relevant period (through, for example, amounts listed on 
financial statements or claimed in interviews) and do the following: 
• Obtain a financial history of the target and spouse, through interviews and other means, 
showing dates and places of employment, salary and bonuses, and any other related 
income. 
• Determine whether the spouse had any separate source of funds that were used to 
purchase jointly held assets or deposited in joint accounts. If so, the spouse must be 
included in the financial profile calculations. 
• Claims of a prior substantial cash hoard might be rebutted by showing that the target 
lived penuriously, borrowed money, made installment purchases, incurred large debts, 
was delinquent on accounts, had a poor credit rating, or filed for bankruptcy. Claims that 
cash came from family or other private loans might be rebutted by showing that the 
alleged lender was incapable of generating the amounts supposedly lent, the absence of 
any documentation reflecting the source of the alleged loan (no bank account 
withdrawals), and the absence of other sources of funds available to the lender.
