CASHIER’S CHECKS 
Cashier’s checks  are issued and certified by a bank with itself as the drawer. These items are 
called treasurer’s checks when issued by a trust company. They are frequently an excellent 
lead to other bank accounts, stock, real property, and other assets. Because cashier’s checks 
can be held indefinitely, subjects sometimes purchase cashier’s checks instead of keeping 
large amounts of currency on hand. In reconstructing a subject’s transactions with cashier’s 
checks, be sure that all checks are accounted for because subjects sometimes exchange 
previously purchased checks for new ones.  
 
Bank checks, such as cashier’s checks, can be extremely time consuming and expensive to 
locate unless you know the date and number of the check. However, if the subject has 
deposited a bank check into his account, or purchased a bank check using a check from his 
account, then copies of bank checks are much easier to obtain because the subject’s account 
records will reveal the date and number of the bank check.
