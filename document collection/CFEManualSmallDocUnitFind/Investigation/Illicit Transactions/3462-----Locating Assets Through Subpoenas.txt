Locating Assets Through Subpoenas 
Although examiners investigating fraud do not have an absolute right to see non-public 
records, those who are involved in investigations involving civil or criminal proceedings 
might have subpoena power allowing them to obtain such records, including bank account 
and loan records, records from accountants and tax preparers (including income tax returns 
and related documents), mortgage company records, telephone records, credit card 
statements, credit reporting company records, hotel and travel records, telex records, 
overnight package envelopes, and passports.
