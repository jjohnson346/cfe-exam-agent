Gaining Access to Records Held by Financial Institutions 
One of the most difficult challenges to the fraud examiner will be to gain access to the 
records held by financial institutions. Although bank records are one of the most important 
sources available to fraud examinations, they are not readily obtainable. Most suspects will 
not willingly give their records to a fraud examiner, especially if the records contain 
potentially incriminating evidence.  
 
Moreover, financial institutions’ authority to di sclose bank records is restricted by federal 
and state law. For example, the Right to Financial Privacy Act prohibits financial institutions 
from disclosing financial information about individual customers until the governmental 
authority obtains the customer’s consent, a court order, a subpoena, a search warrant, or 
some other formal demand, with limited exceptions. And even though Right to Financial 
Privacy Act applies only to demands by governmental agencies, most banks and other

financial institutions also will not release such information to private parties absent legal 
process, such as a subpoena issued in a civil lawsuit. 
 
As a result, substantial requirements must generally be met before banks will disclose such 
information. In general, bank records can be obtained in most jurisdictions by using one of 
the following methods: 
• Civil discovery 
• Administrative subpoena or summons 
• Civil summons 
• Customer authorized disclosure 
• Court subpoena 
• Grand jury subpoena 
• Search warrant  
 
Furthermore, the cost of obtaining bank records can be quite high. Banks generally charge 
both public and private entities to search and retrieve records. There are usually additional 
costs for the reproduction of records. It might be prudent for the examiner to limit record 
requests as much as possible.  
 
Despite such complications, the examiner might attempt to obtain the financial records of 
suspects by contacting their former spouses. Former spouses might have banking records 
useful to the fraud examiner that they may be happy to turn over. Similarly, the banking 
records might also be a part of a divorce settlement or a lawsuit.
