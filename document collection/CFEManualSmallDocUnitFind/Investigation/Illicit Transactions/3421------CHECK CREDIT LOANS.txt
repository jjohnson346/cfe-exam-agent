CHECK CREDIT LOANS 
Check credit is another loan service that more and more banks are offering. Under a check 
credit plan, the bank agrees to extend credit to a customer up to a maximum amount. If the 
amount of the check is not in the customer’s a ccount, the resulting overdraft is set up as a 
loan. The bank then bills the customer for the loan. Another plan is a specialized checking 
account that is used only up to a predetermined amount under a loan agreement; the 
outstanding balance is treated as an installment loan by the bank. Copies of loan agreements 
and statements under both plans can be obtained from the bank files.
