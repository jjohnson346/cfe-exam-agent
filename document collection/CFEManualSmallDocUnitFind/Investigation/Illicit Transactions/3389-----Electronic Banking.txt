Electronic Banking 
Electronic banking is possibly the most common form of banking today. Electronic banking 
includes automated teller machine transactions; point-of-sale transactions using credit or 
debit cards; smart cards, which are gaining popularity in the U.S. (and are already popular in 
Europe); wire transfers; online bill payment through Internet banking and biller websites; 
and traditional automated clearing house (ACH) applications of direct payment and direct 
deposit. 
 
All of these forms of electronic banking are governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act 
(EFTA) (15, U.S.C., § 1693 (See Appendix A)). The EFTA currently requires financial 
institutions to keep records on all transactions of $3,000 or more.
