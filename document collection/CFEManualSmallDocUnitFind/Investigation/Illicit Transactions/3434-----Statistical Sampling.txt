Statistical Sampling 
If an anomaly is found in the financial statements and transactions and further investigation 
is desired, it might be appropriate to pull a statistical sample. By using statistical sampling, 
the examiner can look at fewer transactions rather than the entire population.  
 
There are two basic risks associated with statistical sampling: sampling risk and nonsampling 
risk. Sampling risk  is the probability that the sample is not representative of the population; 
nonsampling risk  is the possibility of making the wrong decision. Nonsampling risk cannot be 
quantified. However, fraud examiners can control it through adequate planning and 
supervision of audit engagements. 
 
When using statistical sampling, you must draw a random sample. That is, each member of 
the population must have an equal chance of being selected. There are two primary types of 
statistical sampling: attribute and discovery.
