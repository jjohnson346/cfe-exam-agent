Total Deposits 
Total deposits consist not only of amounts deposited to all bank accounts maintained or 
controlled by the target but also deposits made to accounts in savings and loan companies, 
investment trusts, brokerage houses, and credit unions. Total deposits also include the 
accumulation (increase) of cash on hand. Because some subjects have bank accounts in 
fictitious names or under special titles, such as “Special Account No. 1,” “Trustee Account,” 
or “Trading Account,” the investigator should  look for this type of account during the 
investigation. If a subject lists checks on a deposit ticket and deducts an amount paid to him 
in cash (split deposit), only the net amount of the deposit should be used in computing  
total deposits. 
 
Additional items that must be included in deposits are property and notes that the subject 
received in payment for services. The accepted practice is to consider these items as 
depositories into which funds have been placed for future use.
