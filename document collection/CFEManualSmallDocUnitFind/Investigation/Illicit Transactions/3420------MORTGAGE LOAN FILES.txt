MORTGAGE LOAN FILES 
Mortgage loan files often contain the most detailed financial statements submitted by the 
subject. The loan file should identify the title company that handled the closing, the 
homeowner’s insurance carrier, the closing attorney, and perhaps the real estate broker. The 
title company files often contain copies of the cashier’s checks used for the down payment, 
which can identify new accounts. 
 
The homeowner’s insurance policy might contain a rider that lists the homeowner’s valuable 
assets, such as jewelry or furs, perhaps with appraisals and purchase receipts. The closing 
attorney will have many of the same materials found in the title company files. The real 
estate broker might keep copies of personal checks used for deposits and provide 
information about other real estate transactions by the subjects. Don’t forget to look for 
accelerated or lump sum payments on the mortgage balance.
