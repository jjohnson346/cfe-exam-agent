THE BEHAVIORAL PROFILE 
The financial profile might give inaccurate or false negative readings unless certain activities 
are identified, which is done through preparing the behavioral profile. The behavioral profile 
might also provide evidence of a possible motive of the crime, such as large debts, as well as 
additional evidence of illicit funds. For example, if the suspect spent significant amounts of 
cash, and had no corresponding cash withdrawals from his disclosed bank accounts, or no 
admitted sources of cash income, he must have  other undisclosed sources of income.

Using the financial/behavioral profile as a guide, request an interview with the suspect. Pin 
down the suspect’s income, assets, and accounts. Otherwise, the subject might invent 
excuses or prepare false testimony or documentation to account for the unexplained income.
