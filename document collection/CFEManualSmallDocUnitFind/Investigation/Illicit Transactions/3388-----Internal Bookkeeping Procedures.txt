Internal Bookkeeping Procedures 
The internal record-keeping practices and procedures of banks not only are complex but 
they constantly are changing because of the growing sophistication of computer technology. 
Banks are moving steadily toward an electronic funds-transfer system that will eliminate the 
use of checks. Such a system will automatically transfer money from the account of the 
purchaser to the account of the seller. Paper trails will disappear. Detailed familiarity with the 
intricacies of internal bank operations is not essential, however, for the fraud examiner to 
obtain the types of information necessary for investigations. What is essential is the 
knowledge that records of customers’ transactions are maintained and retained.
