Wire Transfers 
A wire transfer  is a method of transferring money from one bank to another. These transfers 
are processed by banks and by wire remittance companies such as Western Union and 
MoneyGram.  
 
Like other transactions, banks keep records of wire transfers. The records will identify who 
sent the wire, where it was sent, the date, and the amount. If the transfer was to a bank in 
the United States, the bank should have a record of the account number of the account into 
which the funds were deposited. If the wire was sent offshore, however, tracing the transfer 
depends on the laws and policies of the country and the receiving institution.
