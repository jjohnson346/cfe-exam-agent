Insurance Policies 
Some targets may purchase insurance. Under the terms of a whole life or universal life 
insurance policy, the borrower may make additional payments on the policy. These payments 
accrue at a high interest rate and enhance the overall value of the insurance policy.  
 
A sophisticated subject might deposit substantial monies into an existing insurance policy 
thinking that the fraud examiner will not look beyond the face value of the policy into the 
equity built up by prepayments. The fraud examiner should, therefore, always examine the 
financial statement of a target to locate insurance policies and examine the equity in these 
policies as a potential asset.
