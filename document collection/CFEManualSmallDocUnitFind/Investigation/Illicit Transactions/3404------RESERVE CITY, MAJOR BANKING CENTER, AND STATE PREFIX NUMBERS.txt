All banks in an area served by a Federal Reserve bank or branch carry the routing symbol of 
the Federal Reserve bank or branch. The Federal Reserve routing symbol (FRRS) 
encompasses the first four digits of the nine-digit routing number. This routing symbol 
identifies where the Federal Reserve bank is located. The first two numbers of the FRRS 
designate the Federal Reserve District in which the bank is located (as shown below). The 12 
Federal Reserve Districts and numbers are as follows:  
 
01—Boston, MA 
02—New York, NY 
03—Philadelphia, PA 
04—Cleveland, OH 
05—Richmond, VA 
06—Atlanta, GA 
07—Chicago, IL 
08—St. Louis, MO 
09—Minneapolis, MN 
10—Kansas City, KS 
11—Dallas, TX 
12—San Francisco, CA 
 
The next two numbers designate the specific bank location of the Federal Reserve branch. A 
thrift institution is designated when “2” is added to the first digit of the FRRS. For example, 
if there is a thrift institution in the first district (Boston) the designation would be “21.” If 
the thrift institution is in a district that has a double digit, such as San Francisco, the 
designation becomes “32.” The next four numbers of the routing number sequence are

number is a digit derived from an algorithmic calculation.
