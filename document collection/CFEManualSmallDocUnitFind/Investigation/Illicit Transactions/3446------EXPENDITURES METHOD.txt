EXPENDITURES METHOD 
The expenditures method (also known as the sources and application of funds method) 
compares the suspect’s known expenditures and known sources of funds during a given 
period of time. Any excess expenditures must be the result of income from unknown 
sources. It is closely related to the net-worth analysis, accounting variations of the same 
principle. 
 
The table below illustrates the formula used to compute net worth using the expenditures 
method. The steps are discussed in greater detail below  
 
Expenditures  (Application of Funds)  
– Known source of funds  
= Funds from unknown sources  
 
To compute the subject’s net worth using the expenditures method, follow three steps. First, 
establish the subject’s known expenditures for the relevant year. Expenditures include the 
use or application of funds for any purpose, including deposits to bank accounts, purchase 
of major assets, travel and entertainment expenses, and payment of loan and credit card 
debts. Second, identify all sources of funds available to the subject, including loans and gifts, 
as well as cash on hand from previous years. Third, compute the difference between the 
amount of the suspect’s expenditures and his known income to determine the amount 
attributed to unknown sources.

   Salary 30,000 38,000 
   Interest earned on savings

   Loan proceeds 8,000  
 TOTAL $40,000 $ 40,000 
Funds from unk nown or illegal sources   0 $40,000 
 
The following example demonstrates how a net-worth analysis assisted prosecutors in their 
amended complaint against a fraud suspect. 
 
EXAMPLE 
R. Peery, age 40, the executive director of a five-state commission planning a low-level 
radioactive waste dump was charged with two ne w charges of felony theft. Peery was also 
charged with one federal count of wire fraud. 
 
Peery was accused of wiring $115,000 to a personal account in Georgia, and prosecutors 
said they suspected him of taking $600,000. He was also charged with  two counts of using 
commission funds in Nebraska to buy cars, a 1990 BMW valued  at $67,000 and a 
1991 BMW valued at $92,000. 
 
Peery was paid $52,000 annually. He lived in a house valued at $305,000 and at the 
time of his arrest had six luxury cars, including Jaguars, Mercedes-Benzes, and BMWs.
