Direct Methods of Tracing Financial Transactions 
A subject’s income can be established by the direct or indirect approach. The direct 
approach, or the specific-items method of proving income, relies on specific transactions, 
such as sales or expenses, to determine income. The indirect approach relies on 
circumstantial proof of income. Indirect methods will be discussed in the next section. 
 
To trace financial transactions using the direct method, the examiner must obtain relevant 
financial records.
