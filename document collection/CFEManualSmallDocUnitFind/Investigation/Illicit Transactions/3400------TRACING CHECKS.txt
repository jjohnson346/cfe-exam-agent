TRACING CHECKS 
Tracing checks is facilitated by the use of bank identification symbols. Fraud examiners do 
not have to understand the internal bookkeeping procedures used by banks. The concept of 
bank identification symbols, however, is of interest. All checks printed for banking 
institutions contain an ABA transit number. These numbers represent an identification code 
developed by the American Bankers Association. The ABA transit number enables a check 
to be routed to the bank of origin. In the process of routing, a trail is left.
