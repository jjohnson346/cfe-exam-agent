SAMPLING FOR ATTRIBUTES 
Sampling for attributes is used by auditors or fraud examiners looking for a deviation 
occurrence rate (deviations, errors, and exceptions  are synonyms). When performing this type of 
sampling, you are looking for the presence or absence of a defined condition. 
 
EXAMPLE 
For each sales invoice in the sample, is there a corresponding shipping order? The answer to the 
question can only be “yes” or “no.” If the control condition is that each sales invoice is not 
recorded until there has been a shipping order attached, then any “no” response for a booked 
sale would represent an error.
