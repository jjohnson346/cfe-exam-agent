Types of Forensic Document Examinations 
There are many different types of forensic document examinations. However, most 
examinations (more than 95 percent of all U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory 
Investigation  Analyzing Documents 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.105 
document examinations, for example) concern signatures, handwriting, hand printing, or 
documents created by a typewriter or word processor. Additionally, issues concerning 
photocopies and determining when a document was prepared frequently arise. Fraud 
examiners should be aware that many different types of forensic examinations are possible, 
but that the following forensic examinations could be of particular value when a fraud 
involves documents: 
• Detection of forged signatures 
• Identification of the writers of signatures, handwriting, and hand printing 
• Detecting altered documents 
• Detecting and restoring erasures and eradications 
• Determining when a document was or was not prepared 
• Detecting counterfeited documents and examining printed documents 
• Detecting and restoring faint indented writings 
• Comparisons of paper and inks 
• Determining whether two sheets of paper came from the same tablet or pad of paper 
• Examinations of paper folds and sequence of folds 
• Comparisons of torn or cut paper edges 
• Restoration of charred and partially burned documents 
• Identifying the machine that made a photocopy and whether two copies were made on 
the same machine 
• Examinations of facsimile (fax) copies 
• Identifying the source of, or alterations to, notary seals, wax seals, and cachets 
• Detecting the opening and resealing of sealed documents and examining adhesives 
• Detecting inserted text in typewritten, printed, or handwritten documents 
• Determining the sequence of handwritten text, signatures, and typewriting 
• Identifying rubber stamp impressions 
• Identifying mechanical check-writer and numbering-device impressions
