Preparation for Taking Dictated Handwriting Samples 
Since expert handwriting identifications can truly prove the case, adequate pre-interview 
preparation by the fraud examiner is essential. At the time of the interview session to obtain 
dictated writing samples, the investigator should have all of the proper writing materials and 
should have the original or copies of the evidence documents to serve as a guide for 
dictating the sample text. Do not rush through the interview. Take as much time as 
necessary. Take short comfort breaks if the suspect tires. Do not allow the suspect to see the 
evidence documents before or during the taking of the samples.
