Counterfeit Printed Documents 
Most documents that have monetary value, such as currency, bank checks, traveler’s checks, 
money orders, bearer bonds, postage stamps, gift certificates, or lottery tickets, have all been 
counterfeited at one time or another. Identity documents are also often counterfeited, for 
example, passports, birth certificates, drivers’ licenses, and government and commercial 
employee identity cards. Other counterfeited documents include commercial product labels, 
business stationery and forms, business logos, motor vehicle titles and registration forms,

and safety inspection stickers. Despite most preventive measures, if a document has any 
value it can be, and probably has been, counterfeited. Counterfeiting has become big 
business, especially in some third-world countries, where the latest developments in printing 
technology are being used to produce large quantities of high-quality counterfeit documents 
and “knock-off” phony products in violation of international copyright and trademark laws.
