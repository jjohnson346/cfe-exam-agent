The “Alibi” Document 
These documents suddenly appear “from out of nowhere” and often late in the course of  
an investigation, inquiry, or trial. They are always favorable to the suspect and refute 
previously developed information or evidence that is damaging to the suspect. Many prove 
to be fabricated.
