Chronologies 
A chronology of events should be commenced early in the case. The purpose of maintaining 
a chronology is to establish the chain of events leading to the proof. The chronology might 
or might not be made a part of the formal report; at a minimum, it can be used for analysis 
of the case and placed in a working paper binder. Keep the chronology brief and include 
only information necessary to prove the case. By making the chronology too detailed, you 
defeat its purpose. The chronology should be revised as necessary, adding new information 
and deleting  
the irrelevant.
