Transient “Trash Marks”  
Trash marks are uniquely identifiable markings on copies. They are usually caused by dirt, 
smudges, or small bits of foreign matter on or in machine surfaces that will appear until the 
machine is cleaned or serviced. These markings prove not only that a particular machine was 
used to produce the copy, but that documents that share the same transient trash marks 
might have been produced at approximately the same time. This is one of several ways to 
determine when a document was prepared.
