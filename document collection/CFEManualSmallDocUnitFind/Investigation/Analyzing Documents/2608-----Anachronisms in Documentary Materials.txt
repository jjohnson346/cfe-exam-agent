Anachronisms in Documentary Materials 
Exposure of fraudulent historical documents often relies upon the combined skills of 
investigators, historical experts, scientific laboratories, and forensic document examiners. 
Accurate handwriting comparisons are rarely possible in the absence of adequate 
contemporaneous genuine writings of the purported author. Instead, examinations are made 
of the materials used to produce the documents, such as paper, ink, printing, adhesives and 
seals, bindings, and covers. Detection of backdated contemporary documents usually relies 
upon diligent investigation and the techniques of the forensic document examiner. 
 
When adequate handwriting or signature samples are available, expert comparisons can 
expose the forgery. Otherwise, in order to disprove the purported date of the document, 
analyses of the materials might prove that they did not exist at the time the document was 
supposedly prepared. Expert examinations of contemporary documentary materials include: 
• Ink analyses and comparisons with a library of ink standards maintained by the U.S. 
Secret Service Laboratory in Washington, D.C., to determine the kind of ink and when it 
was first manufactured. 
• Examinations of typewriting and comparisons with collections of typewriter reference 
standards maintained by forensic laboratories to determine the kind of typewriter that 
was used and when the typewriter was first manufactured. 
• Examinations of paper, especially watermarked paper, and searches of reference 
materials to determine who manufactured the paper and when it was first produced. 
• Examinations of photocopies and fax copies and comparisons with reference standards 
to determine what kind of machine was used and when those machines were first 
produced. 
• Comparisons of questioned photocopies with photocopies known to have been 
produced on a particular machine on a particular date can prove or disprove the date of 
the questioned copy. 
 
Fraud examiners should note that there are currently no methods for accurately determining 
how long ink, typewriting, or photocopier/printer toner have been on paper.
