Undictated Writing Samples 
Try to obtain samples of a suspect or victim’s signature or other writings that were not 
prepared by him specifically for comparison purposes, but that can be authenticated. Courts 
will accept as authentic comparison documents any writings that were witnessed by others. 
Also acceptable are documents that were created “in the normal course of business,” such as 
canceled checks; signed or written documents in employee personnel records; applications 
for employment, licenses, or home utilities installations; and many others. The fraud 
examiner should use personal experiences and knowledge of the suspect’s routine activities 
in locating sources for these types of samples. 
 
When the evidence documents include suspected forged signatures, several genuine samples 
of the forgery victim’s signature should be obtai ned for submission to the expert. If possible, 
include any documents bearing genuine signatures of the victim’s that the suspect might 
have had access to and that might have served as a model for tracing or simulation.

 Undictated writing samples should: 
• Be as contemporaneous as possible to the date of the evidence documents; if the 
questioned writings were prepared in the 1970s, writings recently prepared by a suspect 
might not be adequate for comparisons. However, except for infirmity or extreme age, 
the writings of most adults usually do not change much except over long periods of time.  
• Consist of the same signature or words containing many of the same letters and 
combinations of letters as the questioned writings on the evidence documents. 
• Consist of the same type of writings as on the evidence documents, such as hand printed 
or handwritten, capital letters or small letters or a combination of both. 
• Consist, if possible, of the same kinds of writings. A person’s informal writings, such as 
hastily prepared signatures on credit card receipts, might be very different from more 
formal writings, such as a signature on a contract or other legal document.
