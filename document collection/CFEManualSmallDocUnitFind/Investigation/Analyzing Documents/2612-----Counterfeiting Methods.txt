Counterfeiting Methods 
The days of old-style counterfeiters — who were skilled artisans who carefully etched 
counterfeit printing plates — are over. Today most counterfeit documents are prepared by 
various photo-reproduction processes such as the photo-offset printing process 
(lithography) and flexography, which uses rubberized printing “plates.” These processes 
begin with the photographic reproduction of a genuine document. The photographic 
negatives are then carefully retouched to remove the filled-in text, serial numbers, and other 
distinguishing features that appeared on the genuine document. Printing plates are then 
made from the retouched negatives, and counterfeit copies are printed from the plates.  
 
Rapidly advancing technology now allows larcenous novices with no commercial printing 
experience to use sophisticated computerized scanners, computer graphics software, 
multicolor computer printers, and full-color photocopy machines to produce relatively high-quality 
counterfeit documents.
