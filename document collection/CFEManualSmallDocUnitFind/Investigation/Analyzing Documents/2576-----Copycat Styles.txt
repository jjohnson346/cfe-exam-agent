“Copycat” Styles  
Some writers, especially adolescents, the young, and the easily influenced, might adopt the 
general handwriting style or some individual letter designs of a respected teacher or parent, 
or one shared by their peers. An example is the exaggerated rounded letter forms and 
circular “i” dots and periods that form the so-called bubble writings of some adolescent 
females. This style is usually abandoned as the person matures.
