Open Questions 
Open questions are those worded in a way that makes it difficult to answer “yes” or “no.” 
The answer is also not dependent on the question. The typical open question calls for a 
monologue response, and it can be answered in several different ways. During the 
information phase of the interview, the interviewer should endeavor to ask primarily  
open questions. This is to stimulate conversation. Some of the best open questions are 
subtle commands. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Please tell me about your job.” 
 
“Please tell me about the operation of your department.” 
 
“What do you think about this problem?” 
 
“Please describe the procedures to me.”
