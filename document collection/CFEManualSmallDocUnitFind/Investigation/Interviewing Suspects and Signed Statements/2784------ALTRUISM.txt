ALTRUISM 
In many cases, the moral seriousness of the matter can be reduced by claiming the action 
was for the benefit of others. This is especially true if the accused views himself as a  
caring person. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I know you didn’t do this for yourself. I have looked into this matter carefully, and I 
think you did this to help your husband, didn’t you?” 
OR 
“E. J., you have a big responsibili ty in this company. A lot of people depend on you for their 
jobs. I just know you did this because you thought you were doing the right thing for the 
company, didn’t you?”
