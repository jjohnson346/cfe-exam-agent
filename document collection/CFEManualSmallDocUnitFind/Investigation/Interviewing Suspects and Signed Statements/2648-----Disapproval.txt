Disapproval 
A less intense but more common effect of ego threat is found when respondents possess 
information but are hesitant to admit it because they anticipate disapproval from the 
interviewer. If respondents are made to feel that the interviewer will not condemn them, 
they might welcome the opportunity to divulge information. A generally accepting and 
sympathetic attitude toward the respondent goes far toward eliciting candid responses.
