Ritual 
Some aspects of conversation are ritualistic; that is, they are merely a form of verbal behavior 
that has no real significance other than to provide security in interpersonal relations. 
Examples include “Good Morning!” and “How are you today?” In interviewing, we must 
learn to detect ritualistic answers by the respondent, and avoid giving them ourselves. The 
interviewer must be aware of the danger of engaging in ritualistic conversation and then 
confusing the results with valid information.
