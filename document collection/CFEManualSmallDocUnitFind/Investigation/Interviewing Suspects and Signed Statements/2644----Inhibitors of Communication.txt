Inhibitors of Communication 
To be an effective interviewer, one must understand that certain matters inhibit 
communication, while others facilitate it. It is the interviewer’s task to minimize inhibitors 
and maximize facilitators. An inhibitor is any social-psychological barrier that impedes the 
flow of relevant information by making the respondent unable or unwilling to provide the 
information to the interviewer. Eight inhibitors to communication are listed below. The first 
four tend to make the respondent unwilling; the last four make the respondent unable to 
give the information, even though willing.
