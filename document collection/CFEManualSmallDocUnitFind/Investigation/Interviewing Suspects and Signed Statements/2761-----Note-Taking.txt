Note-Taking 
When conducting an admission-seeking interview, note taking should be kept to a minimum. 
In some cases, taking notes should be altogether avoided. Since the ultimate goal of the 
admission-seeking interview is to obtain a signed statement in which the suspect admits guilt, 
it is not necessary to take extensive notes, which can be distracting to the suspect and can 
reveal what points the examiner believes to be important. Notes, if taken during the 
interview, should be done in a way that does not reveal their significance.
