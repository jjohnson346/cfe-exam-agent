Reconfirm Facts 
It is not unusual for the interviewer to have misunderstood or misinterpreted statements of 
the respondent. Therefore, to ensure that the interviewer understood the information that 
the witness provided, he should review the key facts during the closing phase of the 
interview. However, the interviewer should not attempt to revisit all the information 
provided by the subject, only the facts that are most relevant.
