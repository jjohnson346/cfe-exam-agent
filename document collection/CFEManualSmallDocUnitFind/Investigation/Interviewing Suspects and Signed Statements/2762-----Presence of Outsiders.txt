Presence of Outsiders 
It is usually not necessary to inform the subject that he may have counsel present. Of course, 
this right cannot be denied if the subject wishes to have an attorney present. If counsel is 
present, you should have an understanding that he will be an observer only; attorneys should 
not ask questions or object. Other than the subject and two examiners, no other observers 
should be permitted in the admission-seeking interview. If the accused is in a union, a union 
representative (or a union attorney) might have the right to attend. However, this might 
present legal problems in “broadcasting” the allegation to a third party. It is very difficult to 
obtain a confession with witnesses present. The examiner should therefore consider whether 
the case can be proven without the admission-seeking interview. (Please refer to the Law 
section of the Fraud Examiners  Manual  for more information.)
