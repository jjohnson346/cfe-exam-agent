Make It Easy to Say “Yes” 
In trying to negotiate with difficult people, the usual tactic is for the interviewer to make a 
statement and attempt to get the respondent to agree with it. A better choice is to agree with 
one of the respondent’s statements  and go from there. It is better to break statements into 
smaller ones that would be difficult to disagree with. This helps the difficult person  
save face.
