Use of Deception in Interviews 
Surprisingly, the use of deception to gain information can sometimes be employed legally. 
The theory is that information can be obtained by nearly any means, with the exception of 
force or threats. The interviewer, however, might not employ any deception likely to cause 
an innocent person to confess. The use of deception is not justified regarding promises of 
leniency, promises of confidentiality, or to obtain a monetary or business advantage.
