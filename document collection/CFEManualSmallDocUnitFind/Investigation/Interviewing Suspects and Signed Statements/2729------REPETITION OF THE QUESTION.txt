REPETITION OF THE QUESTION 
Repeating the question is a means for a deceptive respondent to gain more time to think of 
what to say. The respondent may repeat the question verbatim, or he may frame the answer 
with a request to repeat the question (e.g., “What was that again?”  or similar language). 
Conversely, a truthful subject usually does not have to contemplate his answer.
