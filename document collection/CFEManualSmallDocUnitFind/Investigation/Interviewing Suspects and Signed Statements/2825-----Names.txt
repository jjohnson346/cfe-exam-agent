Names 
Often, the name of the suspect or another person will be spoken during an event, but many 
times the event proves too traumatic or happens too quickly for a witness to recall. If a 
witness cannot remember any names spoken during the event ask him to attempt to recall 
the first letter of the suspect’s name (or any other names spoken) by going through the 
alphabet one letter at a time.
