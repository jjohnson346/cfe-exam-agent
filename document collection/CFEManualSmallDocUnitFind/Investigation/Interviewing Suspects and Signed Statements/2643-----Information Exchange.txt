Information Exchange  
Information exchange is the central purpose of the interview. The word exchange reminds us 
that the flow of information in an interview goes both ways. Too frequently, interviewers 
become so concerned with the information they wish to obtain that they do not properly 
exchange information with the respondent. Although details of what the interviewer says 
should be carefully measured, don’t be cagey.  This tactic rarely works. Two basic problems 
occur in the exchange of information. First, the information sought by the interviewer is not 
of equal importance to the respondent. Second, there is often a communication barrier 
between people of diverse backgrounds. These barriers are common between people who 
don’t know one another.
