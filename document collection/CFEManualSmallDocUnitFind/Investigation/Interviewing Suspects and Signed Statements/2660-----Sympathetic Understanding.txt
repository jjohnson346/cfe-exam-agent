Sympathetic Understanding 
Human beings need the sympathetic response of others. They like to share their joys, fears, 
successes, and failures. This need for understanding differs from the need for recognition 
that requires success and increased status. Interviewers who reflect a sympathetic attitude 
and who know how to direct that attitude toward the objectives of the interview will find 
their percentages of success much higher than those who do not.
