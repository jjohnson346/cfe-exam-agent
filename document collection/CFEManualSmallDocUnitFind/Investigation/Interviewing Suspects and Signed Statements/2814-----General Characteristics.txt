Interviewing Suspects and Signed Statements

General Characteristics 
• Logical structure: The fraud examiner first examines the statement for “plot holes,” 
checking to ensure that the recounting of events is chronologically correct and does not 
contain contradictions. 
• Unstructured production: The fraud examiner should examine this criterion at the 
beginning of the interview by allowing the subject to recount the event without influence 
or questioning. Generally, an honest person will not tell an interviewer exactly what has 
taken place in complete chronological order, from start to finish. It is much more likely 
that the initial recounting of events will be told in a scattershot fashion, but that these 
facts and details will eventually mesh into a complete version. When an interview subject 
is able to sit down and initially describe the events that have taken place in complete 
detail, from beginning to end, it is likely that the story has been rehearsed. 
• Quantity of details: An honest subject is more  likely to be able to recall many details 
within an interview than a dishonest subject. When most subjects fabricate a story, they 
are unable to bolster the story with very many details.
