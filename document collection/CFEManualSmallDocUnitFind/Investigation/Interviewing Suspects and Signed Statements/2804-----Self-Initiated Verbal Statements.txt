Self-Initiated Verbal Statements 
These responses from interviewees are made without any prompting by the interviewer. 
Examples of these statements include changes in speech pattern, overly respectful or friendly 
words directed at the interviewer, or indirect answers and statements. The subject’s speech 
speed will tend to increase, or the subject will hesitate or stammer frequently before giving 
any responses. These verbal clues are a subconscious attempt by the interviewee to dodge 
the line of questioning or suppress the guilty feelings he feels. 
 
Generally, a dishonest person is much more likely to give more self-initiated verbal signs 
than a person who is telling the truth.
