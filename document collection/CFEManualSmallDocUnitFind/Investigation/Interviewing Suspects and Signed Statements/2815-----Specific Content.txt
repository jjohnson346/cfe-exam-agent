Specific Content 
• Contextual embedding: This criterion suggests that a truthful subject’s statement will be 
tightly woven with incidental details, such as the subject’s daily routine, habits, or family 
relationships. A deceptive subject is much less likely to associate an event with seemingly 
insignificant details such as these, choosing to focus only on covering up the major event 
that is being discussed. 
• Descriptions of interaction: The truthful subject is likely to have some description of the 
actions and emotions involved with the described incident or people involved in the 
incident.

• Reproduction of conversation: Often, the witness will become animated when repeating 
any conversation related to the incident. When this occurs, the subject is generally telling 
the truth, as it is difficult for a fraudster to create cohesive dialogue on the spot. 
• Unexpected complications during the incident: Descriptions of incidents that disrupt the 
event, such as a sudden halt or interruption of the event, indicate that the subject is 
speaking truthfully.
