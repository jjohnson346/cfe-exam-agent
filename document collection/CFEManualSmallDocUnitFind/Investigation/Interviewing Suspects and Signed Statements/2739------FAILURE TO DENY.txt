FAILURE TO DENY 
Dishonest people are more likely than honest people to deny an event specifically. An 
honest person might offer a simple and clear “no” while the dishonest person will qualify the 
denial: “No, I did not steal $43,500 fr om the company on June 27.” Other qualified denial phrases 
include, “To the best of my memory,” and “As far as I recall,” or similar language.
