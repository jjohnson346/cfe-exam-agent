INADEQUATE RECOGNITION 
Some employees might feel that their efforts have gone completely without notice by the 
company. As with similar themes, the interviewer should be empathetic. 
 
 EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I have found out a few things about you. It looks to me that you have given a lot more 
to this company than they have re cognized. Isn’t that right, Linda?”
