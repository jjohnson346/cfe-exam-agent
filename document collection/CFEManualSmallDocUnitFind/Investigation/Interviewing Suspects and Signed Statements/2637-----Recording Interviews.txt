Recording Interviews 
In some circumstances, recording an interview might be illegal. Both state and federal law 
limit an employer’s right to record employee interviews during an investigation. In fact, in 
some states, audio recording an interview is permitted only with the consent of all parties to 
the communication. Thus, fraud examiners should always consult with an attorney when 
deciding whether to record an interview.  
 
If recording an interview without the respondent’s consent is legal, consider tape recording 
the interview covertly. Covertly recording offers an advantage in that it provides an accurate 
record without disturbing the flow of the interview. If there is to be a covert tape recording 
and the subject asks if the interview is being recorded, do not lie. Explain that it is in the 
subject’s best interest that an accurate recording be made and that he can have a copy when 
completed.
