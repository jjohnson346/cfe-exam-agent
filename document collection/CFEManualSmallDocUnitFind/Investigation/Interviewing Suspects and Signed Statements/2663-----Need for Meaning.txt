Need for Meaning 
Another general trait common to people is the need for meaning. Every society has a set of 
assumptions, values, explanations, and myths lending order to the society. The concept of 
need for meaning is related to cognitive dissonance. Psychological tension is created when an 
individual becomes aware of incongruence of facts, assumptions, and interpretations. This 
tension is painful, and its reduction is rewarding to the individual. In cases where the 
interview topic deals directly with the sources disturbing a person’s system of meaning, there 
is a strong motivation for the respondent to talk it through, if he is convinced of the 
interviewer’s interest.
