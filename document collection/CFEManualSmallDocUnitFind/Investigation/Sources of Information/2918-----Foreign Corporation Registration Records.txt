Foreign Corporation Registration Records 
Some states, but not all, require foreign corporations (i.e., corporations that were 
incorporated in another state) to register with the state corporation office if the foreign 
corporation transacts business in that state. For example, if a corporation chartered in 
Delaware wishes to transact business in Texas, it must file an Application for Certificate of 
Authority. The application is filed with the secretary of state and must include the date of 
incorporation, the principal office, the address of the registered agent, and the names of the 
officers and directors.
