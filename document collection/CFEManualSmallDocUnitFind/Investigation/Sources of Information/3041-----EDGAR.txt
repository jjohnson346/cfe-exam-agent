EDGAR 
EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) is a system that collects 
documents submitted by companies and others who are required by law to file with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). EDGAR performs automated collection, 
validation, indexing, acceptance, and forwarding of SEC filings. Its primary purpose is to 
increase the efficiency and fairness of the securities market to benefit investors, 
corporations, and the economy by accelerating the receipt, acceptance, dissemination, and 
analysis of time-sensitive corporate information filed with the SEC.  
 
Not all documents that public companies file with the SEC, however, will be available on 
EDGAR. Even so, several important documents, such as Form 10-K or 10-KSB, are 
required to be filed on the EDGAR system. For more information, visit 
www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml.
