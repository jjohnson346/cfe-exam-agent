ALTAVISTA 
Altavista is a detail-oriented search engine. Because it reads the individual text of every page 
listed on the Internet, Altavista is very useful for finding random information. If you are 
simply “casting your line” to see what information might be available on a topic, this is a 
good engine to use. However, Altavista’s searches are so thorough you will encounter every 
page that contains your keyword(s), ending with as many as 200,000 hits. Successful Altavista 
searching requires you to construct your search carefully.
