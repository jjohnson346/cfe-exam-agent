National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System 
The National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS) is the International 
Justice and Public Safety Information Sharing Network, which is a sophisticated 
communication network that links all law enforcement and criminal justice agencies in the 
United States, Puerto Rico, and, through a computerized link to INTERPOL, Canada.  
 
NLETS provides two basic capabilities to its users. First, it is an international, computer-based 
message-switching system that links together state, local, and federal law enforcement 
and justice agencies for the purpose of information exchange. Second, it provides 
information-services support for a growing number of justice-related applications. To 
accomplish this, NLETS supports data-communi cations links to state networks using a 
commercial frame-relay service. All agencies within each state are serviced through this state 
interface. Federal and international systems operate in much the same manner. The primary

NLETS operational site is located in the Arizona Department of Public Safety’s facility, and 
a disaster-recovery site that enables full resumption of operations in fewer than 30 minutes 
was developed with the Idaho State Police. 
 
The user population is composed of federal agencies with a justice component, selected 
international agencies, and all states and territories, all of which are cooperatively exchanging 
data. Agencies include state and local law enforcement groups, motor vehicle and licensing 
departments, and a variety of federal enforcement offices, such as the U.S. Customs Service, 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Marshals 
Service, Naval Investigative Service, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Department 
of State, Department of the Army, and Department of the Interior. The National Auto 
Theft Bureau also is linked to NLETS. NLETS users can send free-form messages to other 
users either individually or via a broadcast message. 
 
A great deal of information is available to law enforcement through the network, including: 
• Vehicle registrations by license plate or vehicle identification number 
• Driver’s license and history by name and date of birth, or driver’s license number (some 
states support driver’s license queries by name only) 
• Criminal records by name and date of birth, state identification number, or FBI number 
• Boat registrations by hull number, registration number, or name 
• Snowmobile registrations by registration number, vehicle identification number, or 
owner’s name and date of birth 
• Hazardous material file by UN number, which is an internationally recognized code for 
hazardous material 
• Private aircraft tracking data by registration number or date range 
• Aircraft registrations by registration number, serial number, or name of registrant 
• Directory of participating agencies by originating agency identifier 
• Registration information on diplomatic license plates 
• Index to parole/probation and corrections information 
• Sex offenders registration information 
 
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police’s Canadian  Police Information Centre provides many 
additional files, including: 
• Wanted people by name and date of birth 
• Criminal history by name or FPS (Canadian national identification number) 
• Stolen vehicles by license number or vehicle identification number
