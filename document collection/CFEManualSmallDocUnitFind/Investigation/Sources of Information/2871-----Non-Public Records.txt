Non-Public Records 
In addition to public records, non-public records—financial or otherwise—might be needed 
to prove fraud or to provide leads in a fraud examination. Non-public records include 
information about a person or business considered to be private and confidential. Because 
fraud examiners do not have an absolute right to see these personal records, such 
information might be difficult or impossible to obtain unless it is voluntarily turned over or a 
subpoena is issued. 
 
Some of the most valuable personal records include: 
• Banking records 
• Tax returns and related documents 
• Credit records 
• Telephone records 
• Credit card account records
