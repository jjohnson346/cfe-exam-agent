Real Property Records 
Each real estate transaction will list a deed verifying the transfer of the property. If an 
individual either buys or sells a house or piece of property, or his real property becomes 
subject to a state or federal lien, the transaction will be reflected in the county real property 
indexes. If improvements are made to the property, such as the addition of a new room or 
the installation of a pool, then a mechanic’s lien or other notice may be on file in the county 
property records.
