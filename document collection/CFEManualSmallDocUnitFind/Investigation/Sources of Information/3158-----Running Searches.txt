Running Searches 
The Internet is not so much a service as a tool. To tap its rich information sources, you have 
to learn how to construct proper queries; that is, you have to learn how to ask for what you 
want. Search engines all have their limitations, but the most serious impediment to locating 
good information is the user’s lack of search skills.  
 
Most searching uses keywords. For instance, when hunting for the latest statistics on check 
fraud, the logical keywords are check  and fraud. However, if you typed in those words, the 
search engine would return numerous sites that have nothing to do with check fraud. By 
placing both words inside quotation marks (i.e., “check fraud”), you will get better results. 
Still, the list of hits will be in the thousands, so you might want to further narrow the search 
using the techniques below.
