Department of the Treasury 
The Department of the Treasury includes several statutory inspector general law 
enforcement agencies.  
 
Within the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Criminal Investigation (CI) Division 
conducts investigations of tax fraud relating to income tax, excise tax, occupational tax, and 
violations of currency-transaction reports. Enforcement efforts include tax violation, money 
laundering, currency crimes, and asset forfeiture. The release of taxpayer information to 
other than IRS personnel requires special procedures. The IRS Inspection Service maintains 
information on subjects of investigation and their relationships to IRS employees (e.g., 
threats made against, collusion with, and bribery of IRS employees). 
 
The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) safeguards the financial system from 
the abuses of financial crime, including terrorist financing, money laundering, and other illicit 
activities. FinCEN works to maximize information sharing among law enforcement agencies 
and its other partners in the regulatory and financial communities. Through cooperation and 
partnerships, FinCEN’s network approach encourages cost-effective and efficient measures 
to combat money laundering domestically and internationally. The USA PATRIOT Act 
section 314(b) permits financial institutions, upon providing notice to the United States 
Department of the Treasury, to share information with one another in order to identify and 
report to the federal governmental activities that may involve money laundering or terrorist 
activity. However, access to these records by outside parties is extremely limited.
