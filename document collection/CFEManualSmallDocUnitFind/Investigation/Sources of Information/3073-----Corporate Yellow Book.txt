Corporate Yellow Book 
The Corporate Yellow Book is a directory of the people who manage, direct, and shape the 
largest public and privately held companies in the United States. Published quarterly, it 
enables subscribers to access corporate leaders, including board members who are taking 
increased responsibility for corporate decision-making and administrative-services 
professionals. The directory features (1) the names and titles of more than 26,000 executives, 
including more than 7,000 corporate board members and their outside affiliations; (2) the 
direct-dial telephone numbers of executives and more than 10,000 e-mail addresses for 
officers, management, and administrative-services professionals; (3) the addresses, telephone 
and fax numbers, and Internet addresses of each entity’s corporate headquarters, foreign 
subsidiaries, and divisions; (5) the contacts for each entity’s administrative services, such as 
benefits, corporate contributions, foundations, governmental affairs, information systems, 
libraries and information centers, purchasing, real estate and facilities, recruitment, and 
shareholder relations; and (6) four indexes:  organization, industry, geographical, and 
individual’s name.
