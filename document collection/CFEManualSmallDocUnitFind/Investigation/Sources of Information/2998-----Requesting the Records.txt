Requesting the Records 
The simplest way to obtain relevant documents is to request them. This usually works for 
examiners representing large organizations that are important customers to the party with 
the information. Vendors and other customers of the company conducting the investigation 
may cooperate voluntarily if they have nothing to hide (or think that incriminating evidence 
cannot be found) and are anxious to maintain good relations with the company.
