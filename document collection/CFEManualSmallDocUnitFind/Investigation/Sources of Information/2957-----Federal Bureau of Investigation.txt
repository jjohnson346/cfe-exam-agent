public corruption, civil rights, white-collar crime, organized crime, major thefts, and  
violent crimes.  
 
The Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System, more commonly known as 
IAFIS, is a national fingerprint and criminal-history system maintained by the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division. The IAFIS 
provides automated fingerprint search capabilities, latent searching capability, electronic 
image storage, and electronic exchange of fingerprints and responses 24 hours a day, 365 
days a year. As a result of submitting fingerprints electronically, agencies receive electronic 
responses to criminal 10-print fingerprint submissions within two hours, and within 24 
hours for civil fingerprint submissions.  
 
The IAFIS maintains the largest biometric database in the world, containing the fingerprints 
and corresponding criminal history information for more than 55 million subjects in the
