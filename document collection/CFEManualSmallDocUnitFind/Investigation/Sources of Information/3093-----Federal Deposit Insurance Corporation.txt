Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is an independent agency of the federal 
government that insures deposits in banks and savings associations.  
 
Federal or state banks or savings associations that apply to be insured by the FDIC must 
submit an application that covers financial history, financial condition, capital structure, 
management, future earnings prospects, convenience to and needs of the community, and 
consistency of corporate powers.  
 
FDIC insured banks are examined annually by FDIC insured examiners; FDIC savings 
associations are examined periodically by FDIC examiners. Each examination includes an 
appraisal of management, directors, officers, and staff.  
 
The examination reports contain white and pink sheets. The white sheets provide 
examination findings; a copy is given to the bank’s board of directors. The examiner, 
however, retains the pink sheets, which contain confidential information, including an 
alphabetical list of all directors, officers, and principal employees; their titles; and comments 
on every individual to the fullest extent possible. The examiner also comments on the 
capabilities of each individual, gives his approximate age, and cites other business affiliations. 
Additionally, the examiner completes a form for each individual, setting forth his estimated 
net worth, par value of stock owned, and salary. 
 
Inquiries regarding types of FDIC records available to the public (including records available 
under the Freedom of Information Act) should be directed to the appropriate FDIC 
regional office or to the Office of the Executive Secretary.
