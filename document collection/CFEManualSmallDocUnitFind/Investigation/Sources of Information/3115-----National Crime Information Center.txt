National Crime Information Center 
The National Crime Information Center (NCIC), located at the FBI headquarters in 
Washington, is a widely used law enforcement computer system. Most major law 
enforcement agencies have NCIC connections. 
 
An NCIC file often contains information about: 
• Stolen, missing, or recovered guns 
• Stolen articles (that have a serial number)

• ATF violent felon file 
• U.S. Secret Service protection file 
• Gang and terrorist organizations file 
• Deported felon file 
• Originating agency identifier file 
• Protective order file 
 
NCIC is a computerized index of criminal justice information (e.g., criminal record history 
information, fugitives, stolen properties, and missing persons). It is available to federal, state, 
and local law enforcement and other criminal justice agencies and is operational 24 hours a 
day, 365 days a year.  
 
The purpose of maintaining the NCIC system is to provide a computerized database for 
ready access by a criminal justice agency making an inquiry and for prompt disclosure of 
information in the system from other criminal justice agencies. This information assists 
authorized agencies in criminal justice and related law enforcement objectives, such as 
apprehending fugitives, locating missing persons, locating and returning stolen property, as 
well as in the protection of the law enforcement officers encountering the individuals 
described in the system.
