Tax Related Filings 
Some state revenue departments require certain businesses to obtain licenses or permits, 
such as a sales tax permit. The licenses and the applications are generally public record. If the 
business is delinquent in the payment of its taxes, the local or state tax investigator or 
collector might be able to provide inside information concerning the business. 
 
Law enforcement officials might be able to gain access to corporate, business, and personal 
state tax information. These records might unwittingly reveal hidden assets or investments. 
Loans to or from officers, stockholders, or related entities should be examined closely. Also, 
mortgages, notes, and bonds shown as liabilities on a corporate return should be 
investigated. Tax returns might also disclose the identity of the accountant or attorney 
preparing the return.
