The Finance Board supervises the 12 federal home loan banks (FHLBs), which were created 
by the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, and issues regulations and orders for carrying out the 
Act’s purposes. Savings associations that make  long-term home mortgage loans are eligible 
to become members of an FHLB.  
 
In addition, the Finance Board implements community-oriented mortgage lending and 
affordable housing programs; prescribes rules and conditions under which banks are 
authorized to borrow; issues consolidated FH LB bonds, notes, or debentures that are the 
obligation of all FHLBs; and ensures that the FHLBs remain adequately capitalized and 
operate in a sound manner. 
 
The FHLB system provides a flexible credit re serve for member savings institutions engaged 
in home mortgage lending and includes 12 regional FHLBs that are federally chartered, 
privately capitalized, and independently managed. The 12 FHLBs help their member 
financial institutions meet their communities’ diverse housing-finance and economic-
 development needs. 
 
Each FHLB is capitalized by the capital-stock investments of its member financial 
institutions and its retained earnings. The proceeds of these stock investments are used to 
issue and sell consolidated obligations, which are sold to investors (e.g., commercial banks, 
foreign central banks, mutual funds, corporations, government agencies, and individuals).  
 
In addition, the FHLBs provide loans to their member financial institutions.
