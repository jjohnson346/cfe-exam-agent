Public Record Database Vendors 
Listed below is information about some of the larger commercial database vendors. You can 
shop various services to find the one that meets your needs in the most cost-effective 
manner and the one that fits your current case. In some instances, it may be necessary to use 
more than one service to get an accurate and complete profile. These companies get their 
information from various sources and on various update schedules, so a search in any one 
database may return different results than a search done elsewhere.
