Fair Credit Reporting Act 
One of the primary statutes limiting access to  information is the federal Fair Credit 
Reporting Act (FCRA). This statute regulates the dissemination of consumer information to 
third parties by consumer reporting agencies. Historically, the FCRA only applied to 
consumer credit reports, but due to amendments in 1997, the FCRA now applies to the 
gathering of many other types of information about an individual through third parties. 
 
The FCRA applies in the employment context when an employer contracts with a consumer 
reporting agency (CRA) to collect consumer reports on employees or potential employees. A 
CRA is defined as anyone who sells information about people (e.g., a private investigator or 
an online public records service). A consumer report  is defined as any written, oral, or other 
communication by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a customer’s credit worthiness, 
credit standing, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living. 
 
The FCRA, however, does not apply if the person or organization seeking the information 
gathers it directly from the source.  
 
If the FCRA does apply, it generally means that an examiner cannot use a third party to 
obtain certain information about a person unless that person has received certain notices and 
signed a consent form. The failure to do so can mean civil penalties.
