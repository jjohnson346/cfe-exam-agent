LAST NAME SEARCHES 
Last name searches can be used if the past address is unknown. This search produces better 
results if the name is not common; however, if  the last name is common, differentiating 
information should be included in the search. It should also be noted that some searches will 
return the identities of neighbors, who can be contacted for additional information about the 
suspect.
