Search Engines 
Search engines are website tools that allow you to type in keywords describing the subject in 
which you are interested. The search engine will then scour the pages of the Internet and 
attempt to locate pages that may have pertinent information. For instance, in a search for the 
keyword fraud, the search engine will likely bring back a number of pages that have some 
relevant link to fraud (such as the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners’ website, located 
at www.ACFE.com). There are several prominent search engines on the Internet, and each 
functions in a different way. An extensive list of search engines is provided at the end of the 
chapter; however, a few of the more popular engines are described below.
