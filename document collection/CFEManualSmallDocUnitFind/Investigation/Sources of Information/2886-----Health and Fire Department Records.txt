Health and Fire Department Records 
Most local health or fire departments conduct routine inspections of businesses for health 
and safety code or fire code violations. These inspectors might have valuable information 
about the business, its operations, the employees, and the owners. 
 
Death certificates usually can be found at city, county, or state health departments. A death 
certificate provides the name of the deceased, address, sex, age, race, birthplace, birth date, 
death place, date and time of death, Social Security number, medical certificate, and 
coroner’s certificate. Additionally, a death certi ficate generally provides information about 
the deceased’s parents and their occupations.
