Privacy Act of 1974 
The Privacy Act of 1974 restricts information about individuals, including employees and 
non-employees, that might be gathered by governmental agencies. Under the Act, an agency 
may maintain records about a person containing information that is relevant and necessary 
to accomplish a purpose of the agency. This information may include a person’s education, 
finances, medical history, criminal history, employment history, and identifying information 
(fingerprint, voice print, or photograph). The person may have access to his information 
unless it is investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, statistical records, 
or material compiled solely for determining suitability, eligibility, or qualification for federal 
service or promotion.
