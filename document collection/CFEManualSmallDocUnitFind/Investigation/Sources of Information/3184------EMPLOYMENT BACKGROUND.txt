EMPLOYMENT BACKGROUND 
Online record inquiries regarding employment history have increased significantly over the 
past few years. Corporate downsizing has disaffected an increasing number of workers to the 
point that it is easier for them to rationalize employee defalcation, fraud, or embezzlement. 
The same economic phenomenon of downsizing, combined with business pressure to 
increase productivity and the friction of modern life, have apparently produced an increase 
in workplace violence. Liabilities for employers and businesses have expanded through 
negligence standards and the respondeat superior doctrine for such tortious conduct as vehicle 
operation, assault, battery, false imprisonment, sexual harassment, and discrimination. 
Finally, the potential to be held liable for negative references has deterred past employers 
from responding to prospective employers’ inquiries about an employee. Therefore, 
prospective employers must increasingly rely on public information.  
 
Some of the searches useful in developing background information are listed below (where 
permitted by law): 
• Credit header searches are useful in confirming address and Social Security number 
information. 
• State and federal criminal court records and statewide criminal convictions may be used 
to uncover past criminal problems presaging similar difficulties. Indeed, criminal 
background checks may be mandated by law. For example, the Violent Crime Control 
and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 makes it a felony for insurance companies, as well as 
persons employing anyone to conduct the business of insurance, to hire any individual 
convicted of a felony involving dishonesty or a breach of trust.  
• Aircraft mechanics, airmen, medical license, and other licenses are available to ensure 
that basic job requirements are met in the appropriate circumstance. 
• Consumer credit reports may be obtained for purposes of employee selection, retention,  
and promotion. 
• Public filings such as bankruptcy filings, tax liens, and judgments may be obtained to 
identify adverse financial matters that can serve as potential motivators for fraud, 
defamation, and embezzlement. 
• Where a prospective or current employee drives a personally owned vehicle or an 
employer-owned vehicle in furthering the interests of the employer, such activity may

expose the employer to liability for damages;  therefore, DMV driving records must be 
checked. 
• Basic information concerning job qualification can be verified through education 
verification and employment verification searches. Note: These are verification tools 
only; they are not definitional in terms of discovering past or current employment. 
• Although workers’ compensation searches may return the subject’s name, Social Security 
number, date of birth, employer’s name, date and type of accident, and nature and extent 
of inquiry, the Americans with Disabilities Act may limit usage of the search results. The 
Act purports to prevent prospective employers from using workers’ compensation 
records in denying employment to otherwise qualified applicants.
