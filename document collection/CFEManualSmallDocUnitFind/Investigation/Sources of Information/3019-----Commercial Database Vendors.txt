Commercial Database Vendors 
Commercial database vendors provide users access to very powerful archives of data that 
compile various public records in one searchable database. Unlike public databases, 
commercial databases generally contain a broad range of information and allow the user to 
search millions of records simultaneously. Because these databases contain diverse types of 
information, fraud examiners can use them for many different types of jobs. 
 
Although generally, commercial database vendors do not provide any more information than 
can be accessed from other sources, they have two distinct advantages—search speed and 
constant access. 
 
Generally, commercial database vendors are available online and allow users to retrieve 
requested information through a computer that is connected to the Internet. For such 
databases, there may be an initial access fee, monthly membership fees, or a one-time access 
fee.
