Directories 
The road to mining information on the Internet does not always go through search engines. 
Some of the best investigative tools an examiner has online are directories. As the name 
suggests, directories  are specialized websites that collect the names of numerous other related 
websites, allowing the user to browse through a complete listing of possible sites to visit. 
Directories contain links to pages that have a commonality. Some all-inclusive directories 
cover a plethora of different topics, and others are more focused on particular subjects or 
disciplines. These include several accounting and auditing directories that fraud examiners 
may find very useful.

The upside to using directories is that you can logically navigate a search, easing through the 
different categories until you find what you are looking for. However, directories contain 
only a portion of the sites and pages available on the Internet; therefore, the fraud examiner 
should use directories in concert with a search engine and not instead of one.
