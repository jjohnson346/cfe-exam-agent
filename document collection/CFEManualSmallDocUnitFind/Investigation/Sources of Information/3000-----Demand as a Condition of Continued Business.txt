Demand as a Condition of Continued Business 
Similarly, an organization may demand that a supplier, vendor, or agent turn over relevant 
documents as a condition of continued business. Taking this action is legal, in appropriate 
circumstances. Of course, management and counsel should be consulted before such 
demands are made, particularly if the other party has a contractual relationship with the 
company.
