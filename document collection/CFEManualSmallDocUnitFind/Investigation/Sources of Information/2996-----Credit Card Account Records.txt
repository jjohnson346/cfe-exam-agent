Credit Card Account Records 
Credit card account records can be helpful when conducting a fraud examination. Credit 
card receipts will track the travels of the defendant, and, of course, record expenditures. An 
extremely high balance on a credit card may indicate a motive for the crime or provide 
circumstantial evidence of hidden income. Even modest credit card charges may provide 
leads to identifying hidden assets (e.g., charges for boating supplies purchased at a marina 
might indicate a need for further investigation to determine whether the subject owns an 
expensive boat).
