ENCRYPTION 
Encryption refers to procedures used to convert information using an algorithm (called cipher) 
that makes the information unreadable. Although there are many free and commercial 
encryption programs available, there are two primary ways to access encrypted information. 
First, there are numerous utility programs that can decrypt documents encrypted by many of 
the more common software applications. In addition, some encryption programs have a 
secret “key” for emergencies that may be very helpful in an investigation. There are also 
several companies that specialize in decryption. 
 
Second, there is precedent for forcing a suspect (or employee) to divulge his decryption 
code. The computer is only a container and encryption is an additional lock prohibiting the 
investigator from reviewing the files for potential evidence. An examiner with a legal right to 
examine encrypted data is no different than ordering a suspect or employee to unlock a file 
cabinet to inspect its contents.
