Computer Investigation Versus Computer Forensics 
While at first, the term computer investigation may appear synonymous with computer 
forensics, there is an important distinction between the two. An investigator leading an 
investigation into a crime that involves a computer is not necessarily and, in most cases, 
should not be the forensic examiner. It is important to keep these areas separate. Combining 
the two, especially in cases in which the suspect is already named, invites questions about the 
objectivity of the forensic examination. It could also subject investigators to unwelcome 
scrutiny regarding whether they suppressed exculpatory evidence that may have been found 
during an examination by a more objective investigator.
