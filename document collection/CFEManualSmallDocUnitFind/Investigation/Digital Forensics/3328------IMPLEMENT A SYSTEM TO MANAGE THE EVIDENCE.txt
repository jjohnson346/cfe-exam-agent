IMPLEMENT A SYSTEM TO MANAGE THE EVIDENCE 
Examiners should have a system to track and manage physical and digital evidence. The 
most common method used to track physical evidence is to assign each item a unique 
evidence number. Although this number can be in any format, it should be consistent and 
never repeated.
