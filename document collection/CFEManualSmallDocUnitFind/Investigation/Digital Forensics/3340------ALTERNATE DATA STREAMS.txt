ALTERNATE DATA STREAMS 
Another method used to hide files in Windows systems is the use of the alternate data 
streams of a file or directory. This method, however, is only possible in Windows New 
Technology File System (NTFS) — one of two basic types of file systems used to organize 
data in Windows systems. Alternate data streams are a feature in the NTFS filesystem that 
offers the ability to put data into existing files and folders without affecting their 
functionality, size, or display in many traditional file-browsing utilities like command line or 
Windows Explorer.

Although Windows Explorer does not provide a way to see what alternate data streams are 
in a file, they are easy to make and allow an individual with basic knowledge to hide files 
without having to resort to any third-party tools. 
 
Fortunately, there are forensic tools that can search NTFS partitions for alternative data 
streams.
