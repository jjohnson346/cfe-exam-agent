Joining Files  
The Join function gathers together the specified parts of different data files. Joining files 
combines fields from two sorted input files into a third file. Join is used to match data in a 
transaction file with records in a master file, such as matching invoice data in an accounts 
receivable file to a master cluster. For example, you may need to compare two different files 
to find differing records between files. The following is an example of how joining two files 
can easily provide that information.
