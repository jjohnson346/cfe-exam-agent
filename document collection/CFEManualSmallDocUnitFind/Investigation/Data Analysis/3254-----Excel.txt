Excel 
Excel is a spreadsheet program by Microsoft that can be used for storing, organizing and 
manipulating data. Many accountants, auditors, and fraud examiners use Excel for basic data 
analysis tasks. For example, Excel allows users to sort, subtotal, filter, and merge data. They 
can create calculated fields, as well as perform statistical analysis such as regression.  
 
Excel, however, has many limitations that limit its usefulness for detecting fraud. These 
limitations are discussed in the next section, which examines ActiveData for Excel.
