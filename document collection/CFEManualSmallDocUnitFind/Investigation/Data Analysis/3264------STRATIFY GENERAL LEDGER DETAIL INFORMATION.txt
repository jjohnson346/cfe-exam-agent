STRATIFY GENERAL LEDGER DETAIL INFORMATION 
Look at the multitude of activities in a gene ral ledger and ask yourself, “How can I survey 
this data in an extremely quick manner while efficiently planning my audit?” This test should 
provide the answer because it helps the auditor focus on large-dollar postings, while 
assessing the administrative burden of maintaining low-dollar activity. 
 
The stratification report should be reviewed for: 
• Unreasonably large balances for which the activity could be queried for recalculation and 
proper classification 
• A high number of transactions with low accumulated activity for possible consolidation 
• Planning detailed testing of the journal entry approval process
