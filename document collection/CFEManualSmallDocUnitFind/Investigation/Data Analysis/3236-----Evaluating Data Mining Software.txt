Evaluating Data Mining Software 
Because no single software tool can satisfy all user purposes, examiners must consider the 
applications with respect to their particular needs. Ken Collier, an expert in data 
warehousing, business intelligence, software engineering, and agile methods, and his 
colleagues established a framework for evaluating data mining.3 The framework divided the 
criteria into the following four areas:
