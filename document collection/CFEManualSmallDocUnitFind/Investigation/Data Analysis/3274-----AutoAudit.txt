AutoAudit 
AutoAudit is a comprehensive, integrated audit automation system. In addition to the 
workpapers and reporting functionality, AutoAudit has entity-level and process-level risk 
assessment, staff scheduling, resource planning, issue tracking, time reporting, expense 
reporting, quality assurance, department metrics, and an ad hoc reporting module. All of 
these modules are integrated, and data automatically flows from one module into the next. 
AutoAudit is designed to automate all of the primary processes that occur in an audit 
department.  
 
Although AutoAudit automates many parts of any type of audit, of particular interest to 
fraud examiners are its risk assessment functions. AutoAudit offers an integrated risk 
assessment module with the option of following a horizontal methodology (business process 
risk assessment), a vertical methodology (audit universe made up of user-defined auditable 
entities), or a combination of both methodologies. Specific risks and processes are identified 
by the client, and the risk factors and weights can be customized to fit the specific needs of 
the department and industry. Information about the inherent and residual risks helps 
determine issues during the audit, and the information obtained during fieldwork can be 
pushed back into the risk assessment to use as the starting point for the next cycle of 
planning and auditing.
