Impartiality and Relevance 
Report all facts without bias, and everything relevant should be included regardless of which 
side it favors or what it proves or disproves. At the outset of a fraud examination, the 
examiner should carefully determine what information will be needed to prove the case and 
attempt to include only this information. A report should include only those matters that are 
relevant to the examination. However, almost every investigation yields much information of 
which the relevance is not immediately known. In such cases, it is best to opt for 
completeness.
