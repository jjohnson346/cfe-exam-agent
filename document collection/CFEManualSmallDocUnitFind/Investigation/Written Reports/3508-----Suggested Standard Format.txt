Suggested Standard Format 
Fraud examination reports are not “one size fits  all” items. Obviously, no format can cover 
every specific case, company, or situation. However, a standard format is a good place to 
start. The ACFE recommends the following be included in most reports. A sample report is 
included in the Appendix to this section.
