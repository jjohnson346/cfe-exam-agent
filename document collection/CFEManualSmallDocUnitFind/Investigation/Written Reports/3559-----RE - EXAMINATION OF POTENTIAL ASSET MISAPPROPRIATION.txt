RE: EXAMINATION OF POTENTIAL ASSET MISAPPROPRIATION 
 
DATE: MAY 23, 2009 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
I.  Background 
 
On January 28, 2010, the fraud examination unit at Bailey Books received an anonymous 
telephone call on its fraud hotline from an unidentified man who claimed that he was a 
former supplier to Bailey. The caller alleged certain improprieties in the bidding and 
procurement process. 
 
Based upon this initial predication, a fraud examination was conducted, which included 
reviews of relevant records and interviews of appropriate personnel.  
 
II.  Executive Summary 
 
The fraud examination commenced when Loren D. Bridges, CFE, received a telephone call 
from an unidentified man who said that he had been a long-term supplier to Bailey for 
sundry office supplies and paper. The caller said that ever since Linda Reed Collins had 
taken over as Purchasing Manager, he had been gradually “squeezed out” from doing 
business with Bailey.  
 
Linda Reed Collins has been employed in the purchasing department of Bailey Books since 
June 1, 2005. She was promoted to Purchasing Manager effective November 8, 2007.  
 
Investigation Appendix  Sample Fraud Examination Reports 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.1103 
The Fraud Examination Team reviewed selected purchases from 2007 to 2008 and 
conducted interviews of key participants and Bailey employees who we believed may have 
information regarding the misappropriation of assets. The Team reviewed purchasing 
guidelines, personnel files of interviewees, and various financial documents relating to both 
Bailey Books and Linda Reed Collins.  
 
After obtaining sufficient documentation, the Team interviewed Linda Reed Collins, who 
gave a full signed confession to her misdeeds.  
 
III.  Scope 
 
The objective of the Fraud Examination Team was as follows: 
• Determine the existence of a possible misappropriation of assets of Bailey Books, 
Incorporated. The examination is predicated upon an anonymous telephone call alleging 
improprieties on the part of Linda Reed  Collins, Bailey’s purchasing manager. 
 
IV.  Approach 
 
Fraud Examination  Team Members 
Loren D. Bridges, CFE, Bailey Books;  Tonya Vincent, CFE, Bailey Books 
 
Procedures 
As part of the examination of this matter, the Team took the following actions: 
• Obtained, reviewed, and analyzed memoranda pertaining to the anonymous call 
described previously. 
• Obtained, reviewed, and analyzed Bailey Books’ financial documentation, including 
purchase records, invoices, and canceled checks. 
• Obtained, reviewed, and analyzed records from the St. Augustine County Courthouse 
regarding civil actions in which Edward J. Collins and Linda Reed Collins were named; 
records from the Florida Secretary of State’s Office regarding Collins Marine 
Corporation; records of chattel mortgages held by Linda Reed Collins and Edward J. 
Collins; financial records from Dun & Bradstreet regarding Collins Marine Corporation; 
and public records regarding the financial condition of Linda Reed Collins and Edward J. 
Collins. 
• Conducted surveillance activity in order to determine whether the two key individuals in 
the matter were involved in an illicit relationship.

V.  Findings 
 
Based on the documents reviewed, information collected, and interviews conducted during 
the course of the fraud examination, the Team finds as follows: 
• Did the Fraud Examination Team determine the existence of a possible 
misappropriation of assets of Bailey Books Incorporated?  
 
Yes. The documents and information reviewed and interviews conducted by the Fraud 
Examination Team during the course of the examination indicate that Linda Reed Collins, 
together with James R. Nagel, did knowin gly embezzle approximately $197,773 from Bailey 
Books over four years. During the fraud examination, the Team analyzed financial 
documents and conducted interviews to corroborate the statements of an anonymous caller. 
The following is a summary of the evidence and information supporting the Fraud 
Examination Team’s findings: 
 
On January 28, 2010, an anonymous call was received by the fraud hotline at Bailey Books, 
Incorporated, from a former supplier to Bailey Books. The caller alleged that after Linda 
Reed Collins took over as Purchasing Manager in 2007, she eliminated him as a supplier. A 
subsequent review of purchases made by Bailey Books from 2007 to 2009 showed that a 
continuously increasing share of the company’s paper business was being given to Orion 
Corp., even though Orion submitted written bids in only 63 percent of the cases. 
Investigation Appendix  Sample Fraud Examination Reports 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.1105 
On February 1, 2010, Mark W. Steinberg, CF O of Bailey Books, Inc., was interviewed. The 
purpose of the interview was to inform him of the proposed fraud examination, obtain his 
approval, and secure information from him regarding the purchasing process at Bailey 
Books. In addition to summarizing his responsibilities regarding purchasing at Bailey Books, 
Mr. Steinberg stated that in December 2007 he  sent a memo to all the division heads at 
Bailey Books informing them that all purchases over $50,000 would from then on require at 
least three written bids. 
 
We next examined the personnel records. A review of Linda Reed Collins’s file showed only 
that she had been consistently rated “exceptional” by her supervisors in annual reviews.  
 
On February 4, 2010, an interview was conducted with Roger Donald McGuire, Purchasing 
Agent at Bailey Books. After summarizing the purchasing process at Bailey Books, he stated 
that he had no knowledge of any improprieties committed by Ms. Collins. 
 
The next interview conducted was with Mary Rodriguez De La Garza, a coworker of Ms. 
Collins’s in the Purchasing Department at Ba iley Books. During the interview Ms. De La 
Garza stated that, regarding the purchasing process, it is sometimes not practical to obtain 
bids, such as in emergency situations or when they are short on time. She went on to reveal 
that she had suspected Ms. Collins was having an affair with James R. Nagel, the salesman 
for Orion Corp. In addition, Ms. De La Garz a said she believed that Ms. Collins and her 
husband were having marital and financial problems. She also mentioned that Sara Louise 
Dawson, a former employee under Ms. Collins, had left on bad terms. 
 
The next interview was with Sara Louise Daws on, who wanted to consult with her attorney 
before making an official statement. Ms. Dawson’s attorney, Thomas C. Green, later 
contacted the Fraud Examination Team to let them know that Ms. Dawson was interested in 
making a statement, but only in exchange for an indemnity against all claims arising out of 
her cooperation. After meeting with Mark Steinberg and Lincoln S. Wyzokowski, General 
Counsel at Bailey Books, Ms. Dawson’s and Mr. Green’s proposal was accepted. 
 
On March 3, 2010, Ms. Dawson made her statement, which included the following: 
• After Ms. Collins was promoted to Purchasing  Manager, she began favoring Orion Corp. 
for paper purchases. 
Sample Fraud Examination Reports Investigation Appendix 
3.1106   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• On two occasions in 2009, Ms. Collins author ized prepayment on substantial purchases 
from Orion, even though Ms. Dawson had complained about Orion’s poor quality and 
service. Later Ms. Dawson found out that the orders were never received. 
• Other vendors had complained of being squeezed out of business with Bailey Books 
after Ms. Collins became manager. 
 
Ms. Dawson referred the Team to Becky Robinson in Accounts Payable for further 
information about the orders. Ms. Robinson was interviewed and provided copies of the two 
prepaid invoices to Orion Corp., the amounts of which were $102,136 and $95,637. In 
addition, Ms. Robinson said that Ernie Quincy in  Receiving would be able to verify if the 
two shipments had ever been received. 
 
On April 8, 2010, Ernie Quincy, the Warehouse  Manager at Bailey Books, was interviewed 
and verified that the two shipments in question were never received. The next day, copies of 
the two checks given to Ori on Corp. for payment of the goods that were never received 
were examined. 
 
An interview with David Levey from Jerrico International Paper Company yielded the 
following information: 
• At the time Levey began at Jerrico, Bailey Books was a major customer of theirs, but 
since then their sales to Bailey had dwindled. 
• Levey attempted to revive business with Bailey Books, but by then rumors were 
circulating about an inappropriate relationship between Mr. Nagel of Orion Corp. and 
Ms. Collins.  
• According to Levey, Mr. Nagel had a “bad reputation” in the industry.  
 
Ms. De La Garza phoned the Team on April 13, 2010, to let them know that Ms. Collins had 
plans to meet Mr. Nagel at the bar at the Ho tel Atlantic that afternoon. The Team set up 
surveillance of their meeting and reported that Ms. Collins and Mr. Nagel met at 5:55 p.m. 
and ordered drinks. They held hands under the table, kissed, and left the bar at 7:02 p.m. to 
go to room 652.  
 
A review of St. Augustine County records showed that Edward J. Collins (Ms. Collins’s 
husband) was a defendant in three civil actions. The circumstances of the actions indicated 
that the Collinses were having financial troubles. 
 
Investigation Appendix  Sample Fraud Examination Reports 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.1107 
A review of the Florida Secretary of State’s records showed that the Collinses were the 
incorporators of Collins Marine Corporation. 
 
A review of UCC filings showed that the Collinses had three liens in their name. 
 
A net-worth analysis was performed on the Collinses based on information assembled from 
public records. It showed unexplained income of $31,632. 
 
In an April 19, 2010 interview, Mr. Nagel stated that his relationship with Ms. Collins was 
purely professional and denied any improprieties regarding Orion’s business with Bailey 
Books. Mr. Nagel also refused to provide any of  Orion’s financial information pertaining to 
the two invoices in question. 
 
On April 21, 2010, Owen Stetford, the CFO of  Orion Corp., was interviewed and stated he 
was unable to provide any copies of actual financial information, but that Orion had no 
record of any receipt of payment for the invoices in question, nor any record that such 
orders had been placed or shipped. In addition, Mr. Stetford said that Orion had no 
corporate accounts at Florida Marine National Bank, the bank at which the checks from 
Bailey Books were deposited. Mr. Stetford also stated that the correct corporate name is 
Orion Corporation, not Orion Paper Compan y, as the endorsements indicated.  
 
On May 1, 2010, Mr. Nagel was again interviewed. After being confronted with questions 
and evidence regarding the two payments and the bank account to which they were 
deposited, Mr. Nagel voluntarily gave a statement attesting to his involvement with Ms. 
Collins in the embezzlement of funds from Bailey Books. He attested to the following: 
• In 2009, Ms. Collins told Mr. Nagel that she would approve the payment of invoices 
to Orion Corp. for product that would not be delivered. Ms. Collins authorized the 
payment of two invoices in the amounts of $102,136 and $95,637, but no product 
was shipped on the invoices. Ms. Collins and Mr. Nagel established a bank account 
in the name of Orion Paper Company at Florida Marine National Bank and divided 
the proceeds of the invoices equally.  
 
On May 1, 2010, Ms. Collins voluntarily gave a statement, which included the following: 
• Ms. Collins stated that, starting in 2008, she accepted money from Mr. Nagel to 
ensure that Orion Corp. recei ved preferential treatment in supplying Bailey Books 
with stationery and paper products. On those occasions, she was aware that Bailey 
Sample Fraud Examination Reports Investigation Appendix 
3.1108   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Books was not obtaining the best product at the lowest possible price from Orion; in 
other words, the price charged was substantially higher than market value. 
• Ms. Collins stated that on two occasions in 2009, she authorized the payment of 
invoices for $102,136 and $95,637 wi thout any receipt of merchandise. 
• Ms. Collins estimated that she had received in excess of $150,000 in connection with 
Mr. Nagel. 
 
VI.  Summary  
 
This report reflects that Linda Reed Collins, a purchasing agent for Bailey Books, Inc., 
furnished a signed statement on May 1, 2010, in dicating she had accepted at least $197,773 in 
commercial bribes and other illicit income in a conspiracy with James R. Nagel, an account 
representative for Orion Corporati on, St. Augustine, Florida.  
 
The statements made by Collins are corroborated by the documentary evidence and the 
interviews of other witnesses as described herein.  
 
VII.  Impact to Bailey Books 
 
Over the course of four years, Linda Reed Collins, in partnership with James R. Nagel, 
misappropriated an estimated $197,773 from Bailey Books, Incorporated.  
 
Additional amounts were lost due to Bailey’s overpaying for merchandise sold to it by Nagel. 
Those amounts have not been calculated.  
 
VIII.  Recommendations 
 
It is the policy of Bailey Books to report such matters to the appropriate authorities and to 
assist in criminal prosecution. A full review of internal controls should be conducted to 
determine how such incidents can be detected in the future.

Re: Linda Reed Collins 
 
Dear Mr. Marlow: 
 
We have conducted a fraud examination concerning a possible misappropriation of assets of 
Bailey Books, Incorporated. This examination was predicated upon an anonymous telephone 
call alleging improprieties on the part of Lind a Reed Collins, Bailey’s purchasing manager. 
 
Our examination was conducted in accordance with lawful fraud examination techniques, 
which include—but are not limited to—exa mination of books and records, voluntary 
interviews with appropriate personnel, and other such evidence-gathering procedures as 
necessary under the circumstances. 
 
During the pendency of this examination, Ms. Collins and her confederate, James R. Nagel 
of Orion Corporation, voluntarily furnished signed statements indicating that they 
misappropriated at least $197,773 to their personal benefit.  
 
Based upon the results of our examination and the confessions of Ms. Collins and 
Mr. Nagel, these actions, if proved in a court of  law, could constitute a violation of criminal 
and/or civil law. 
 
Very truly yours,

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Linda Reed Collins has been employed in the purchasing department of Bailey Books since 
June 1, 2005. She was promoted to Purchasing Manager effective November 8, 2007.  
 
On January 28, 2010, the fraud examination unit at Bailey Books received an anonymous 
telephone call from an unidentified man who claimed that he was a former supplier to 
Bailey. The caller alleged certain improprieties in the bidding and procurement process. 
 
Based upon this initial predication, a fraud examination was conducted, which included 
reviews of relevant records and interviews of appropriate personnel. The fraud examination 
revealed multiple purchases by Bailey Books from Orion Corporation, the amount of which 
has increased significantly from 2007 to the present. 
 
Interviews of Bailey personnel indicated that Ms. Collins might have a personal relationship 
with Mr. Nagel, an account representative of Orion Corporation. On May 1, 2010, Nagel 
and Collins were interviewed. Both furnished voluntary signed statements indicating that 
they had appropriated at least $197,773 from Bailey by establishing a fictitious vendor to 
which Bailey’s checks were directed. The checks purported to be for supplies purchased by 
Bailey when in fact no supplies or other items were purchased for this amount. Nagel and 
Collins used the proceeds for their personal benefit. 
 
As reflected by the attached letter dated May 23, 2010, based on all the evidence, Collins and 
Nagel could be in violation of Florida criminal and/or civil laws.

FROM:  LOREN D. BRIDGES, CFE 
SUBJECT:  INTERVIEW OF MARK W. STEINBERG, CPA 
    CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER 
DATE:  FEBRUARY 1, 2010 
______________________________________________________________________________  
 
Mark W. Steinberg, CPA, Chief Financial Offi cer of Bailey Books, was interviewed in his 
office, Room 836, 6200 Bayshore, St. Augustine, FL. The purpose of the meeting was to 
advise Mr. Steinberg of the proposed fraud ex amination, to obtain his approval of the 
proposed plan, and to secure basic information from him on the purchasing function. 
 
Mr. Steinberg was advised of the nature of the anonymous allegations and the result of our 
initial vendor review. He also was informed of our plan to review personnel files and other 
internal company documents and to discreetly interview selected company personnel. He 
agreed to the above, asking that we conduct our examination quickly and in the least 
disruptive manner possible. He agreed that Ms. Collins and the purchasing department 
would not be notified of the examination until decided otherwise. 
 
Mr. Steinberg has been with Bailey Books, In corporated since 1994. Previously, he was 
Assistant Vice President for Financial Affairs fr om 1994 to 2002. He reports directly to Mr. 
Hal B. Marlow, President and CEO of the company. 
 
As CFO, all operating divisions, including purchasing, report to him. It is his responsibility 
to establish and supervise the monitoring of internal controls within the operating divisions. 
In general, Bailey follows the policy of obtaining bids on as many purchases as possible. He 
pointed out that the competitive nature of the retail book industry requires constantly 
obtaining the maximum product for the minimum cost. He has reiterated to managers on 
many occasions the necessity of cutting costs. 
 
Guidelines for purchasing procedures are set forth in Mr. Steinberg’s memorandum to all 
division heads and supervisors dated December 12, 2007. The memo calls for purchasers to 
obtain bids on all purchases of more than $50,000. However, purchases of more than 
$10,000 generally are expected to be bid unless a justifiable reason not to exists. A copy of 
the memo was provided by Mr. Steinberg, and is attached. The copy provided has been 
initialed and dated and is maintained in the evidence file, Room 874, Bailey Books.

TO:   LINDA REED COLLINS, PURCHASING MANAGER 
FROM:  MARK W. STEINBERG, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER 
SUBJECT:  PURCHASING GUIDELINES 
DATE:  DECEMBER 12, 2007 
______________________________________________________________________________  
 
The purpose of this memo is to establish guidelines for major purchases. 
 
Effective at once, purchasing will obtain at least three written bids for items of more than 
$50,000, in all cases. Bids also should be obtained for purchase amounts starting at $10,000, 
where practical. 
 
These bids should be maintained in the file for documentation purposes. 
 
If the lowest bid is not selected, a memo of justification should be prepared and approved by 
me before any purchase is made. You are to be  especially concerned with miscellaneous and 
sundry items, because these items are not price competitive. 
 
Any deviations from the above-stated policy must be approved by me.

DATE: FEBRUARY 4, 2010 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Francis Morris, Personnel Manager, provided the personnel files of Linda Reed Collins, 
Mary Rodriguez De La Garza, and Roger Mc Guire for review. Pertinent data included: 
 
Mary Rodriguez De La Garza:

The personnel file reflected that Ms. Collins was consistently rated as “exceptional” by her 
supervisors in annual reviews. She has executed annual Conflict of Interest Questionnaires 
for 2005 through 2009 indicating that she and her spouse, Edward Collins, had no outside 
employment, investments, or interests with companies doing business with Bailey Books. 
 
The file did contain a copy of IRS form 668-W, Notice of Levy on Wages, Salary, and Other 
Income, dated June 2, 2006, indicating that Ms. Collins and her spouse owed federal taxes of 
$53,219.09. An IRS Release of Levy, indicating that the amount due had been paid in full, 
was filed December 18, 2009.

FROM: LOREN D. BRIDGES, CFE 
SUBJECT: INTERVIEW OF ROGER DONALD MCGUIRE 
DATE: FEBRUARY 4, 2010 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Roger Donald McGuire, Purchasing Agent, Bailey Books, was interviewed at his office, 
Room 537, 6200 Bayshore, St. Augustine, Florida. After being advised of the identity of the 
interviewer and the nature of the inquiry, Mc Guire voluntarily provided the following 
information. 
 
He has been employed by Bailey Books since 2006. He is a purchasing agent whose function 
is to purchase the book inventory. Purchasing policy guidelines require him to obtain bids 
for all purchases over $50,000. He said that bids are submitted in substantially all of his 
purchases of books, and that he estimates somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of his 
purchases are preceded by bids. 
 
Whenever he deviates from selecting the low bidder for a product, he writes a memo of 
justification to the file with approval from his manager. This does not happen on many 
occasions. The reasons for not obtaining bids for products include (1) emergency purchases; 
(2) sole-source purchases; and (3) time pressures. McGuire is aware that the other purchases, 
made by Mary Rodriguez De La Garza and Linda Reed Collins, are made under the same 
guidelines. 
 
He is not aware of favoritism regarding vendors. McGuire has received pressure from 
various vendors from time to time. Examples include “the hard sell” that many vendors try 
with purchasing agents; and occasional efforts by the vendors to get paid early so they can 
earn and collect their commissions. Every now and then, a vendor will attempt to give him a 
gratuity, such as a free case of liquor or a small gift. However, McGuire says he avoids any 
ties to the vendor, as such are prohibited by Bailey’s employee guidelines. 
 
He is unaware of any other purchasing employees making any exceptions to purchasing 
policy. McGuire thinks a great deal of his coworkers Mary Rodriguez De La Garza and 
Linda Reed Collins. He does not know whether they have accepted gifts or gratuities from 
vendors. McGuire thinks it is somewhat unusual that Ms. Collins reserves purchasing 
functions for herself, since hers is primarily a management function. He cannot explain why 
she has reserved this duty. He once volunteered to take over her accounts, but she said she 
would prefer to handle some of the purchasing function herself, to “keep her hand in the 
business.”

SUBJECT: INTERVIEW OF MARY  RODRIGUEZ DE LA GARZA 
DATE: FEBRUARY 5, 2010 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Ms. De La Garza was interviewed at her office in Room, 436, Bailey Building, 6200 
Bayshore, St. Augustine, Florida. After being advised of the identity of the interviewer and 
the nature of the inquiry, Ms. De La Garza vo luntarily provided the following information. 
 
She has been employed at Bailey Books since 2005. In 2008, she was promoted and 
transferred to the purchasing department. Ms. De La Garza’s function is to oversee the 
purchase of magazines and periodicals. She reports directly to Linda Reed Collins, the 
purchasing manager. The other employee in the department is Roger Donald McGuire. 
 
Ms. De La Garza said that she is familiar with operating guidelines of the purchasing 
function. She is required to get bids for all purchases of more than $50,000, and, whenever 
possible, for purchases for less than that amount. As a rule, the purchases are bid for all 
items $10,000 and more. 
 
In some instances, it is not practical or possible to obtain bids; this is especially the case with 
sundry purchases. In addition, whenever shortages of merchandise occur and time is of the 
essence, bids are not sought. For approximately the last year, she has observed that Orion 
Corporation, a supplier of paper to Bailey Books, has received most, if not all, of the paper 
business. The salesman for Orion, Jim Nagel, seems to be very persuasive in dealing with 
Linda Reed Collins, Ms. De La Garza’s boss. 
 
When asked if there were any vendors who received preferential treatment, Ms. De La Garza 
hesitated. She finally said that something was bothering her, and she did not know how to 
discuss it. 
 
When asked to explain, Ms. De La Garza said that she was concerned that any information 
she would offer might get back to Ms. Collins, and that she did not want to bring up false 
accusations. She said that there were several things that do not seem right. 
 
(Page 8) 
Investigation Appendix  Sample Fraud Examination Reports 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.1121 
First, she said that Ms. Collins and her husband, Edward, had not been getting along for the 
past year or two. Edward has a charter boat business that has experienced serious financial 
problems, and she knew that Ms. Collins and he had been arguing over money. 
 
She has seen Ms. Collins come to work several mornings in the last few months with red 
eyes, and it appeared that she had been crying. On one or two occasions, when Ms. Collins 
has arrived upset, she had telephoned Nagel, and Ms. De La Garza thinks Nagel comforted 
her. 
 
Ms. De La Garza isn’t sure about the relationship between Nagel and Ms. Collins, but she 
does know that they are good friends. She is fairly certain that they have had lunch together 
on numerous occasions. Their friendship has been the subject of gossip and speculation; the 
office thinks that they are having an affair. 
 
Ms. De La Garza knows that Nagel has recei ved favored treatment as a vendor. Several 
months ago (exact date not recalled), she heard Ms. Collins call accounts payable and chew 
someone out who did not want to hand-cut a check for Nagel. She does not remember the 
exact circumstances, but she said that during the time she has worked at Bailey, Ms. Collins 
has never hurried up a payment for a vendor, with the exception of Nagel. 
 
Ms. De La Garza does not believe Ms. Collins is doing anything illegal; she thinks, however, 
that Ms. Collins’ judgment might be clouded by  Mr. Nagel, whom she describes as a very 
good-looking and charming man. 
 
When asked if anyone else had any knowledge of the business or personal relationship 
between Ms. Collins and Mr. Nagel, Ms. De La Garza replied that Sara Louise Dawson had 
worked on the Orion account before she left Bailey Books, within the last several months. 
She believes Ms. Dawson had a falling out with Ms. Collins, which prompted her to quit.

DATE: FEBRUARY 5, 2010 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Sara Louise Dawson was interviewed at her residence, 2051 Wisconsin Ave., Apt. 16, St. 
Augustine, Florida, on a confidential basis. After being advised of the identity of the 
interviewer and the nature of the inquiry, she voluntarily provided the following information.  
 
Ms. Dawson advised that she did not wish to answer any questions. She said that her 
employment at Bailey Books was a “closed chapter” in her life, which she did not wish to 
reopen. She described her relationship with Linda Reed Collins as “strained.” She said that 
she wished she could be of assistance because “certain things at Bailey just weren’t right,” 
but she had “to get on with her life.” 
 
After further discussion with Ms. Dawson, in which the importance of her cooperation was 
emphasized, she agreed to speak to her brother-in-law, an attorney, about whether she 
should provide any information. She insisted that any communication with her, including 
this interview, be kept strictly confidential.

SUBJECT: INTERVIEW OF SARA L. DAWSON 
DATE: MARCH 3, 2010 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Sara Louise Dawson was interviewed at the office of her attorney, Thomas C. Green, at 
Suite 400, 6600 Bayshore Parkway, St. Augustine. Mr. Green was present for the entire 
interview. After preliminary discussions about the nature of the inquiry, Ms. Dawson 
voluntarily provided the following information. 
 
Ms. Dawson was employed at Bailey Books Inco rporated in the Purchasing Department 
from February 2006 through January 2010. Her duties included the purchase of magazines 
and periodicals as well as sundries and paper products. In that capacity she worked for Linda 
Reed Collins from November 2007 until Ms. Dawson left the company. 
 
After Ms. Collins’s promotion, she began to favor Orion in paper purchases. Orion’s prices 
were high and the quality of service was marginal. Deliveries often were late or incomplete, 
requiring Ms. Dawson to expend considerable  time and effort in follow-up calls and 
correspondence. 
 
On two occasions near the end of 2009, Ms. Collins directed her to make substantial 
purchases from Orion and to authorize prepayment. The orders were not bid, and prices 
quoted were higher than available from other, more reliable suppliers. Bailey Books also had 
a policy against prepayment of orders. 
 
Ms. Dawson complained to Ms. Collins about Orion’s past performance and suggested that 
other vendors be allowed to bid. Ms. Collins responded that the paper was needed now, that 
there was no time for bids, and that the price differential was insignificant. Ms. Collins also 
said that prepayment was necessary so that Orion could rush the order. 
 
Ms. Dawson said that, in fact, there was no urgent need for the paper, but that, based on 
past experience with Ms. Collins, she believed it was fruitless to resist, and she complied with 
her instructions. 
 
(Page 13) 
Sample Fraud Examination Reports Investigation Appendix 
3.1126   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Shortly thereafter she checked with the receiving department and learned that the order had 
not been received. She advised Ms. Collins, who seemed unconcerned. Ms. Dawson then 
prepared a letter for Ms. Collins’s signature reque sting immediate shipment of the order. Ms. 
Collins declined to send the letter, saying it was not necessary, as Orion had assured her the 
shipment would be received shortly. 
 
A few weeks later, Ms. Collins stopped by Ms. Dawson’s office and closed the door. Ms. 
Collins told her that, because of Orion’s “excellent service” and “loyalty” to Bailey Books, 
she wanted future purchases from them to be on a no-bid basis. Ms. Collins also instructed 
Ms. Dawson to prepay another order, in excess of $100,000 from Orion. 
 
Ms. Dawson does not remember the exact dates or amounts, but suggested Becky Robinson 
in Accounts Payable might be able to provide more information. 
 
Ms. Dawson knew that the previous Orion order had not yet been shipped and informed 
Ms. Collins. Ms. Collins became “nervous and jittery” and insisted she was mistaken. She 
again instructed Ms. Dawson to place the order; Ms. Dawson said she would need approval 
from higher up and an argument ensued. She did not place the order or talk to Ms. Collins 
again. At that time Ms. Dawson said she decided to look for new employment because her 
job had become too stressful. 
 
Ms. Dawson also advised that other vendors, including Jerrico, had complained about being 
“squeezed” out by Bailey Books. Ms. Dawson thought that Jerrico’s prices and service were 
superior to Orion’s, but Ms. Collins would not take their product. Ms. Dawson, through Mr. 
Green, agreed to further interviews, as necessary.

SUBJECT: INTERVIEW OF BECKY ROBINSON 
DATE: APRIL 8, 2010 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Becky Robinson, Accounts Payable Clerk, Bailey Books, Incorporated, was interviewed at 
her office, Room 513, Bailey Building, 6200 Bayshore, St. Augustine, Florida. After being 
advised of the identity of the interviewer and the nature of the inquiry, she voluntarily 
provided the following information. 
 
She has been employed by Bailey Books, Incorporated, since January 2004, and has always 
worked in the Accounts Payable department. Her job is to review invoices for processing 
before payment. She checks the invoice mathematics and extensions, sees whether 
merchandise has been received, and verifies that the invoice has been approved for payment 
by the department head.  
 
Ms. Robinson maintains the invoices. Canceled checks are maintained by Treasury (she 
thinks in Ms. Deborah Roth’s office). She provided copies of two invoices paid to Orion 
Corporation. The documents provided by her were initialed, dated, and secured in the 
evidence file maintained in Room 874, Bailey Books Corporation. Copies of the above-
 referenced documents are attached hereto. 
 
A review of the invoices provided reflect a notation on invoices dated November 16, 2009 
and December 5, 2009—in the amounts of  $102,136, and $95,637, respectively—that 
payment was made before the merchandise was received. Ms. Robinson recalls that Ms. 
Collins called her on two occasions and said that Orion was experiencing cash flow 
problems, and to keep them as a vendor, it would be necessary to give them the money up 
front. 
 
When Ms. Robinson told Linda Reed Collins that she was not supposed to approve payment 
before the merchandise had been received, Ms. Collins got agitated and told Ms. Robinson, 
“I am the senior purchasing official, and I am telling you to do what I say.” Ms. Robinson 
did as she was instructed, but did not follow up to see if the paper had been received. Ms. 
Robinson did not report these incidents. 
 
Ms. Robinson said that Ernie Quincy in Receiving would be able to tell whether the two 
shipments above had been received.

DATE: APRIL 8, 2010 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Mr. Ernie Quincy, Warehouse Manager of Bailey Books, was interviewed at his office, Room 
114, Bailey Building, 6200 Bayshore, St. Augustine. After being advised of the identity of the 
interviewer and the nature of the inquiry, Mr. Quincy voluntarily furnished the following 
information. 
 
A review of his outstanding invoices shows that two Orion invoices — dated November 16 
and December 5, 2009 — have not been received in the warehouse. He remembers that 
shortly after receiving the invoices in 2009, he called Ms. Robinson, who referred him to 
Linda Reed Collins. Mr. Quincy then called Ms. Collins about not having received the paper, 
and she told him not to worry about it; that they had an understanding with the supplier that 
the paper would be delivered later. 
 
Mr. Quincy thought that this situation was unusual, since no other shipments had been paid 
for in advance. He has been Bailey Books’ Warehouse Manager for 12 years.

SUBJECT: INTERVIEW OF DAVID LEVEY, 
 JERRICO INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY 
DATE: APRIL 9, 2010 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
David Levey, Director of Sales, Jerrico International Paper Company, 2901 Island Ave., 
Philadelphia, PA 19530 was interviewed by telephone at his office. After being advised of 
the identity of the interviewer, he provided the following information on a voluntary basis. 
 
Mr. Levey assumed his present position in 2003. At that time Bailey Books, Incorporated, 
was a major customer, with sales in excess of $500,000 annually. Since then the volume has 
consistently dwindled. 
 
In January 2009, Mr. Levey met with Carl Sa nderson, the owner of Jerrico, and discussed 
how to revive the Bailey Books account. Both Mr. Levey and Mr. Sanderson had heard 
“rumors” in the industry that Jim Nagel of  Orion Corporation was “taking care of” Linda 
Reed Collins, Bailey’s Purchasing Manager. Nagel has a very poor reputation in the industry 
and was caught “paying off” on another account several years ago. Mr. Levey declined to 
provide any further details or to identify the source of his information. 
 
As a result of their meeting, Mr. Sanderson and Mr. Levey “decided to test the waters” at 
Bailey Books by submitting a bid at cost for a substantial quantity of Deluxe Bond and 
Standard White to see “if we could open the doors.” The offer was made at the end of 
January 2009, and was not accepted. Since then Jerrico does not even bother to bid and 
expects no further significant sales to Bailey Books.

SUBJECT: INTERVIEW OF JAMES R. NAGEL 
DATE: APRIL 19, 2010 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
James R. Nagel, Sales Representative, Ori on Corporation, was interviewed at his office, 
Room 5214, 2600 Industrial Drive, St. Augustine, Florida. After being advised of the identity 
of the interviewers and of the nature of the inquiry, Mr. Nagel voluntarily provided the 
following information. 
 
He has been a salesman for Orion since October 1999. He sells stationery and paper stock 
to a variety of business enterprises, including Bailey Books, Incorporated. Bailey is not his 
largest account. 
 
Mr. Nagel acknowledges that he knows Linda Reed Collins. He says their relationship is 
purely professional, and he has never socialized with her. He emphatically denies any 
improprieties of any kind, and says he has never offered any gratuities or kickbacks to 
Collins. 
 
Mr. Nagel claims the prices he charges Bailey are competitive, and that if Bailey is paying 
higher prices, it is because they are getting better products. He was presented with two 
invoices, dated 11/16/08 and 12/5/08, which reflect the payments for products that were 
not received. Nagel claims he does not know anything about any missing products, and that 
Bailey’s records were in error. He denies asking for payment in advance to help the cash flow 
of Orion Corporation. 
 
Mr. Nagel denied our request to review Orion’s books and records pertaining to the 
11/16/08 and 12/5/08 invoices, saying the information was “none of your business” and 
“proprietary.” He refused to answer any further questions without his attorney being 
present.

SUBJECT: INTERVIEW OF OWEN STETFORD 
DATE: APRIL 21, 2010 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Owen Stetford, Chief Financial Officer, Orion Corporation, was interviewed in his office at 
2600 Industrial Drive, St. Augustine, Florida. Clifford Karchmer, Orion’s General Counsel, 
also attended the meeting. 
 
We advised Mr. Stetford and Mr. Karchmer of the nature of our inquiry and requested their 
cooperation. We had earlier asked Mr. Stetford to produce copies of Orion’s records 
pertaining to sales to Bailey Books when we telephoned to set up the interview. 
 
Mr. Stetford said that Orion Corporation was formed in 1971 by his grandfather and that the 
company is closely held. Mr. Stetford further stated that Orion is committed to the highest 
level of business integrity, that Bailey Books is a valued customer, and that he is anxious to 
cooperate as far as permitted by company counsel. 
 
Regarding our request to review Orion’s records pertaining to sales to Bailey Books, and in 
particular the invoices dated November 16 and December 5, 2009, Mr. Stetford said that he 
would be unable to provide us with access to the original records on the advice of counsel. 
However, he said he personally reviewed the records and told us that Orion had no record 
of any receipt of payment for the above invoices, nor any record that such an order had 
been placed or shipped. 
 
Mr. Stetford further advised, after reviewing our copies of the canceled Bailey Books checks 
payable to Orion for the above invoices, that Orion does not maintain any corporate 
accounts at Florida Marine National Bank. Furthermore, the correct corporate name is 
Orion Corporation, not Orion Paper Company, as the endorsements indicate. 
 
Mr. Stetford emphatically stated that neither he  nor any other corporate officer was aware of 
or condoned any improper activities regarding their sales. He said that he would direct Mr. 
Nagel to answer any questions regarding sales to Bailey Books Incorporated. 
 
In this regard, we again asked for permission to examine Orion’s records, particularly the 
account receivable records for the period November 2007 through March 2010. Mr. 
Karchmer said that he would take our request under advisement.

James R. Nagel was interviewed at the office of his attorney, Conrad Vance, of the law firm 
Vance, Selig and Reisman, Suite 1000, 1601 Harbor Drive, St. Augustine. Mr. Nagel was 
presented with copies of the checks endorsed “Orion Paper Company,” and asked about the 
bank account to which they were deposited. After hesitating for several moments, he quietly 
admitted to conspiring with Linda Reed Collins to have Bailey Books pay the fake invoices. 
At the conclusion of the interview Mr. Nagel voluntarily executed the attached statement. 
The original of this statement has been witnessed by Bridges and Vincent, and is maintained 
in the evidence file, Room 874, Bailey Books Corporation, 6200 Bayshore, St. Augustine,

I, James R. Nagel, furnish the following free and voluntary statement to Loren D. Bridges and Tonya 
Vincent of Bailey Books, Incorporated. No threats or  promises of any kind have been used to induce 
this statement. 
 
Since 1999, I have been a sales representative employed by Ori on Corporation. Since 2002, I have 
been responsible for paper sales to Bailey Books, Incorporated. 
 
In about January 2008, Linda Reed Collins, Manager of Purchasing, to ld me that she would require a 
“commission” on all sales to Bailey Books by Orion.  I advised my boss, Donald L. Marsh, Sales 
Manager, of Ms. Collins’s demand. Mr. Marsh and I reluctantly agreed to make the payments because 
we believed that it would otherwise be impossible to make any sales to Bailey Books. No other 
person at Orion was informed of Ms. Collins’s demand. 
 
The payments to Ms. Collins bega n about February 2008. Ms. Collins to ld me that she would inflate 
the prices paid to Orion in order to cover the kickbacks. Thereafter, approximately $51,000 was paid 
to Ms. Collins by Orion Corporation checks, payable to Market Research, Inc. Ms. Collins told me 
that Market Research, Inc., was a company she had established. The checks were recorded on 
Orion’s books as consulting fees, and were approved by Mr. Marsh and me. 
 
In about October 2009, Ms. Collins told me that she would approve the payment of invoices to 
Orion for product that would not have to be de livered. Ms. Collins thereafter authorized the 
payment of two invoices in the amounts of $102, 136 and $95,637, which were paid by Bailey Books, 
Incorporated, in December 2009. No product was shipped on these invoices. Ms. Collins and I 
established a bank account in the name of Orion Paper Company at Florida Marine National Bank 
and equally divided the proceeds of the above-mentioned invoices. Ms. Collins prepared my checks, 
which were then deposited to my personal checking account at Flagler National Bank in St. 
Augustine. I spent the proceeds on bills. Neither Mr. Marsh nor any other person at Orion was aware 
of the above activity. 
 
I make this statement in order to express my regret for having engaged in the aforementioned 
conduct, and promise to make restitution to the extent possible. I knew my conduct was wrong, but I 
felt it was justifiable at the time. I will try to pay any losses that have occurred as a result of my 
activities. 
 
I have read this statement, consisting of this page. I now sign my name below in the presence of the 
undersigned witnesses because the statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

I, Linda Reed Collins, furnish the following free and voluntary statement to Loren D. Bridges and 
Tonya Vincent of Bailey Books, Incorporated. No threats or promises of any kind have been used to 
induce this statement. 
 
I am Senior Purchasing Agent for Bailey Books, Incorporated, and have been employed by Bailey 
Books since 2005. My job is to oversee the purchase of merchandise and other supplies for Bailey 
Books, Incorporated. As part of my job, I am to ensure that Bailey Books, Incorporated, receives the 
highest quality products at the lowest possible cost. 
 
Commencing in approximately February 2008, and continuing through the current time, I have 
accepted money from James Nagel, Sales Representative for Orion Corporation, St. Augustine, 
Florida. Nagel offered me money to ensure that his company received preferential treatment in 
supplying Bailey Books with stationery and paper products. 
 
On those occasions that I accepted money, I was aware that Bailey Books, Incorporated, was not 
obtaining the best product at the lowest possible price. The price charged for products delivered 
during the time I accepted money was substantially higher than market value. 
 
In November and December 2009, I authorized the payment of invoices of $102,136 and $95,637, 
respectively. These invoices were paid without the receipt of any merchandise. Nagel and I 
subsequently split the proceeds of these invoices equally between us. 
 
I estimate that I have received in excess of $150,000 in  connection with Mr. Nagel. I am not sure that 
anyone at Orion Corporation knew of our arrangement. No one at Bailey Books had knowledge of, 
or participated in, my scheme. 
 
I am aware that my conduct is illegal, and violated Bailey Books’ policies. I participated in this 
scheme because my husband and I were having severe financial problems due to his business. We 
used the proceeds of my conduct to pay off several personal and business-related debts that were 
past due. I am truly sorry for my conduct, and I promise to repay any resulting damages. 
 
I have read this statement consisting of this page. I now sign my name below because this statement 
is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
