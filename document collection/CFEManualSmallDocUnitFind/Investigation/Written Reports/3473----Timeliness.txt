Timeliness 
Timeliness of reports is extremely important because it tends to enhance the accuracy of 
witness testimony. Another aim of timeliness is to preserve the examiner’s memory of the 
interview(s). All interviews should be transcribed as soon as possible after the questioning. 
Upon completing the examination, the examiner should prepare a final or interim report 
(whichever is appropriate) as soon as possible.
