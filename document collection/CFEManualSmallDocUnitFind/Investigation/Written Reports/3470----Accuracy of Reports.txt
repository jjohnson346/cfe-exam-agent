Accuracy of Reports 
Written reports must be accurate because an inaccurate report will affect the credibility of 
the report and the report’s author. Each contact an examiner makes during the course of a 
fraud examination should be recorded on a timely basis in a memorandum of interview (i.e., a 
written record used to document all interviews conducted during the investigation).

3.902   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Although there is no need to recapitulate testimony word for word, for accuracy’s sake the 
fraud examiner should include all facts of possible relevance. 
 
You should reconfirm dates and supporting information with the respondent. It is important 
to reconfirm the facts before  the report is written, not after. Attachments to the report, if any, 
should be completely described. Inaccuracies and careless errors are inexcusable and can 
render a report useless.
