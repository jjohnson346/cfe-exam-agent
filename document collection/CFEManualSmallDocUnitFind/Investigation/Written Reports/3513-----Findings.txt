Findings 
This section contains the details of the fraud examination. It will generally consist of several 
pages. In this section you should describe what tasks you performed and what you found. 
Provide enough detail so that the reader understands what occurred, but not so much detail 
that the reader begins to lose interest or becomes bogged down in the details. The reader 
wants to know how many invoices were forged, who was involved, how they did it, and what 
proof you have. 
 
If the findings section is long, you may wish to use subheadings for particular topics or 
individuals to make it easier for the reader to stay organized. 
 
The information can be presented either chronologically or by topic — whatever makes it 
easier for the reader to follow.
