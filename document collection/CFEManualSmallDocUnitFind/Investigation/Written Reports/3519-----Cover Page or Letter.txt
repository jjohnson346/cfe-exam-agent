Cover Page or Letter 
A cover page  summarizes the examination’s salient points. The cover page should be direct and 
succinct. If a report is submitted to an outside agency (such as law enforcement or outside 
counsel), a cover letter should accompany it. The cover letter should recapitulate 
information in the report and summarize the principal weaknesses. It is not necessary to list 
all witnesses, only those most valuable.
