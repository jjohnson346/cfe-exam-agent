Paragraph Structure 
State a paragraph’s main point in its first sentence. Subsequent sentences should support and 
clarify that main point. For the purposes of report writing, paragraphs should be short. 
Readers can be daunted by long, complicated paragraphs that contain multiple issues. (Note 
also that short paragraphs result in more white space on the page, making the document 
more readable.)
