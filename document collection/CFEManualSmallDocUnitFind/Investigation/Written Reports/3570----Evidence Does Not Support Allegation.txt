RE: [Fraud Examination] 
 
Dear Mr./Ms. [                    ]: 
 
We have conducted a fraud examination concerning a possible [misappropriation of assets] 
of [Company Name]. This examination was predicated upon [information resulting from a 
routine audit of the company’s books by  the company’s internal auditors]. 
 
Our fraud examination was conducted in accordance with lawful fraud examination 
techniques, which included [an examination of  books and records; voluntary interviews of 
appropriate personnel; and other such evidence-gathering procedures as necessary under the 
circumstances]. 
 
Because of the nature of fraud, no assurances can be given that fraud does not exist. 
However, based on the results of our examination, we have found no evidence to support 
the conclusion that [the assets in question were misappropriated].  
 
Sincerely,
