REPORTING STANDARDS 
 
Documenting results is a particularly important function in fraud examinations. In many 
instances, the written report is the only evidence that the work was performed. Cases can be 
won or lost on the strength of the written report. It conveys to the litigator all the evidence 
and provides credence to the fraud examination and to the examiner’s work. It forces the 
examiner to consider his actions during an investigation by requiring that they will be 
documented. It omits irrelevant information, thereby allowing pertinent facts to stand out. A 
first-rate written report is based on a first-rate examination.
