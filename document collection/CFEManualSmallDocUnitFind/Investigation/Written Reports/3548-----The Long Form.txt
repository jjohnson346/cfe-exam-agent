The Long Form 
The long form is similar to an engagement letter prepared for specific-scope examinations 
performed by auditors. The examiner describes the procedures in detail and limits the scope 
of an examination to the procedures defined. It is not recommended for use in engagements 
requiring the investigation of fraud allegations and a concluding opinion on the existence  
of fraud. 
 
At the onset, the examiner might not know what procedures will be necessary to resolve the 
allegation. Consequently, it is difficult to describe, with any precision, the anticipated 
procedures before the examination begins.
