Point of View 
Point of view indicates the writer’s relation to the in formation presented, as reflected in the use 
of person. The writer usually expresses point of view in first-, second-, or third-person 
personal pronouns. The use of the first person indicates that the writer is a participant or 
observer (“This happened to me;” “I saw that ”). The second and third person indicate that 
the writer is writing about other people (“This happened to you, to her, to them”). When 
writing a report, one should never use the writer  to replace I or me in a mistaken attempt to 
sound formal or dignified.  
 
CHANGE:  The writer  believes that this examination will be completed by the end  
of June. 
 
  TO :  I  believe that this examination will be completed by the end of June.
