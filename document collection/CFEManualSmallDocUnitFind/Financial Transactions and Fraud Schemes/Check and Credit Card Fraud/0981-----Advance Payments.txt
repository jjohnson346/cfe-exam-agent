Check and Credit Card Fraud

Advance Payments
Consumer regulations require credit card issuers to credit customers’ accounts immediately 
upon receipt of payment. This means deducting from the balance of the account before the 
check or other payment instrument has actually cleared the bank. A loophole such as this is 
easily exploited by experienced fraud rings. 
 
Using a forged or counterfeit check, an advance or overpayment is made on a stolen credit 
card. Since the issuer must credit the payment at the time it is made, there is no time to 
verify the authenticity of the check. Consequently, cash advances and purchases can be made 
immediately. This scheme can be extremely lucrative to the perpetrators.
