Biller Direct Systems 
Existing EBPP systems usually fall within one of two categories: biller direct systems and 
consolidation/aggregations systems. In a biller direct system, merchants deal with each 
customer individually. In a typical transaction, the customer will enter an Internet site that 
the biller has created. There, the customer who wishes to pay his telephone bill online will 
simply log on to the telephone company’s web site, enter a username and password that 
allows the customer to pull up a copy of his bill, review it, and instruct the biller to obtain 
payment from the customer’s bank account. Prior to this time, the customer will have 
entered into an agreement with the biller to receive and to pay his bills electronically. The 
customer will have created the username and password (which qualifies as an access device 
under EFTA) and will have provided the biller with information about the customer and the 
customer’s account at the financial institut ion from which the biller may collect payment. 
Typically, this will include the customer’s e-mail address, the routing number of the 
customer’s bank, and the customer’s account number at the bank. In some systems, the 
biller will send an e-mail to the customer indicating that a bill is outstanding and directing 
the customer to the biller’s website. 
 
After the customer views the information posted by the biller, the customer may approve 
the information and authorize payment. The biller will then initiate payment by contacting a 
payment provider that has agreed to collect payments on behalf of the biller. The payment 
provider will contact the financial institution that holds the customer’s account and request 
the institution to debit the customer’s a ccount and remit the proceeds to the payment 
provider. The payment provider will then credit the proceeds, minus any fees, to the biller. 
These payments may be transferred through an ACH transfer or through a paper transfer
