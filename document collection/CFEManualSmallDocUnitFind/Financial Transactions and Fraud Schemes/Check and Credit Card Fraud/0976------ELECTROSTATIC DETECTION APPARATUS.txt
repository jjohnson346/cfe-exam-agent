ELECTROSTATIC DETECTION APPARATUS 
This tool allows examiners to detect indented writing from the top page of a pad of paper up 
to five pages below the original. The Electrostatic Detection Apparatus uses photocopier 
toner to develop the areas of indentation after a document has been covered with an 
electrically charged plastic film. In the best of cases, when the document is processed with 
the electrostatic device and the toner image is developed, the writing impressions are clearly 
defined and highly contrasted. If the developed writing is to be used in an investigation or to 
demonstrate results for the courts, the examiner must turn to electronic image processing 
technology for further enhancement.
