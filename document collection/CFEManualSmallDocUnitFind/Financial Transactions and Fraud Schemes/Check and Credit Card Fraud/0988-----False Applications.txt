Check and Credit Card Fraud


:


False Applications 
Perpetrators might apply for a new card using information stolen from a wallet, purse, or the 
trash, or by stealing a pre-approved credit card application out of the mail or trash. Also 
“take-one” applications that are prominent in stores offering credit cards to the public are 
ripe for fraud.
