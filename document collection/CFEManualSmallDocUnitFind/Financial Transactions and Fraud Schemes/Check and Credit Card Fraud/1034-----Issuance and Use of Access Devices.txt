Issuance and Use of Access Devices 
Electronic fund transfer fraud often involves individuals who use information to obtain 
access to the accounts of others. As a result, bank personnel can prevent fraud by exercising 
care in the initial decision to allow an individual to access the bank’s computerized services. 
Banks offering EBPP or P2P systems to customers should: 
• Confirm phone and mailing addresses on the application to ensure that they are  
consistent with information about the applicant that is available from other sources and, 
with respect to existing customers, consistent with current records about these  
customers. This may involve obtaining credit reports about the applicant or obtaining 
copies of utility bills that show the applicant’s address. 
• Make sure that the area code on the applicant’s telephone number matches the  
geographical area for the applicant’s address. 
• Send a “welcome” letter to the address on the application with the bank’s return address 
so that the letter will be returned if the applicant is not living at that address. 
• Verify by telephone or additional mailings any change of address requests in the same 
way that you would verify a new account application.

• If a customer reports the loss or theft of an access device, cancel the existing card, PIN, 
or other form of access and issue a new one. 
• If a customer reports that a person previously authorized to use access device reports no 
longer has that authority, cancel all cards, PINs, or other access devices and issue new 
ones to the customer. 
• Always mail PINs separately from other information, such as usernames, with which 
they are associated. 
• Separate the responsibility of bank employees who have custody of information relating 
to access devices from those who have responsibility for issuance, verification, or 
reissuance of PINs. 
• Ensure that any communication concerning usernames or passwords is sent in a secure 
encrypted format. 
• Customers who register for EBPP or P2P systems should be required to provide 
information indicating that they are authorized to use the bank account or credit card 
from which payments will be made.
