Card Scrutiny at Point of Sale 
How often do merchants scrutinize your card? In many stores, they never get the chance. 
Consumers use the credit/debit card machines at the sales counter and the cards never leave 
their possession. While this makes things more convenient for the consumer, it often means 
that the merchant is left holding the bag when a transaction is returned. If one of the key 
authorization components is missing (signature, expiration date, authorization number, card 
imprint) the merchant has to swallow the loss.
