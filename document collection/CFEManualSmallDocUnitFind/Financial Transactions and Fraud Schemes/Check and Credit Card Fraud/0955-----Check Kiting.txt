Check Kiting 
Check kiting is one of the original white-collar crimes. It continues to survive even with a 
financial institution’s ability to detect kiting. In a kiting scheme, multiple bank accounts are 
opened and money is “deposited” from acco unt to account, although the money  
never exists.  
 
Floating makes check kiting possible. Floating is the additional value of funds generated in 
the process of collection and arises because the current holder of funds has been given credit 
for the funds before it clears the financial institution upon which it is drawn. Businesses are 
most susceptible to check kiting, if they have employees who are authorized to write checks 
or make deposits in more than one bank account. Today, check kiting is more difficult 
because electronic technologies are making the float smaller all the time. In many cases, 
electronic debiting to an account occurs simultaneously with the transaction. Unless 
detected, this process can continue indefinitely, covering one check written against 
insufficient funds with another check.
