Detection and Deterrence of Electronic Transfer Fraud 
Considering the limited capacity of banks to shift losses from unauthorized electronic fund 
transfers to their customers, banks should make efforts to minimize the incidence of fraud. 
The very justification for limiting consumer liability may be that banks are in a superior 
position to learn of and counteract fraudulent schemes that are employed to effect 
unauthorized transactions. Banks can take certain initiatives to secure access devices and 
computers from interference. Banks can also follow “know your customer” rules in order to 
prevent the issuance of access devices to individuals who are likely to use them fraudulently.  
 
The following sections provide specific safeguards that banks can perform to reduce the risk 
that they or their customers can become victimized by unauthorized electronic fund 
transfers.
