Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment 
Electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) involves the presentment of bills from one 
or more sellers of goods, or providers of services, to a consumer through electronic means 
and the payment of that bill by the consumer, also through electronic means. Some experts 
expect EBPP to become one of the fastest growing applications of electronic fund transfers.

At present, EBPP systems vary in organization and complexity. They may involve a 
transaction between a single merchant and a customer, or the consolidation of multiple bills 
from different billers or of multiple payments from different customers. Initially, EBPP 
systems were offered by proprietary providers. More recently, however, banks have begun to 
enter the field, often by contracting out implementation of the system to proprietary 
providers. Banks may have an advantage in marketing these systems because consumers who 
are likely to use these systems often have existing relationships with their banks. Bank 
customers, therefore, may be more willing to trust those institutions to handle their accounts 
than to entrust funds to a new entity with whom they have no previous or tangible 
relationship.
