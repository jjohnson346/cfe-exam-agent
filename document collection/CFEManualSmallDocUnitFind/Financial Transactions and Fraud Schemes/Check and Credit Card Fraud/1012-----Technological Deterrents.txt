Technological Deterrents 
Banks can take advantage of technological developments to deter credit card fraud. These 
developments can make both the counterfeiting of cards and use of valid cards more 
difficult. Some of these developments require very little technology. For instance, most 
credit cards now include verification codes on the back to help merchants match cards used 
in purchase transactions with authorized cardholders. Card networks also maintain address 
and zip code verification services so that merchants, especially those involved in Internet or 
telephone transactions, can determine whether the supposed cardholder lives at the address 
given by the person placing the order.
