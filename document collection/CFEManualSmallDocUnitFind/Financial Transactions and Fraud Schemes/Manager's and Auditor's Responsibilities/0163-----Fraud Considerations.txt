Fraud Considerations 
As part of an audit of ICOFR, the auditor must specifically evaluate (1) the controls enacted 
to address the risk of management override of other controls and (2) whether the company’s 
internal controls adequately address the risk of material misstatement due to fraud. These 
controls include:  
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.238                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• Controls over significant unusual transactions;  
• Controls over journal entries and adjustments made during the end of the period 
financial reporting process;  
• Controls over related party transactions; 
• Controls related to significant management estimates; and 
• Controls that mitigate the motivations for, and pressures on, management to engage in 
inappropriate earnings management and financial statement fraud. 
 
Further, if the auditor discovers any deficiencies in these controls, the auditor should address 
the deficiencies when responding to the risks of material misstatement during the financial 
statement audit.
