INDEPENDENCE 
Both the audit organization and the individual auditor must remain independent in both fact 
and appearance throughout the engagement so that all opinions, conclusions, judgments, and 
recommendations made by the auditor will be impartial and will be viewed as impartial by 
knowledgeable third parties. In determining independence, auditors must consider three 
types of potential impairments— personal impairments, such as family relationships, financial 
interests, or biases; external impairments  arising from actual or perceived pressures from the 
audited organization’s management or employees; and organizational impairments, which occur 
when the audit function is organizationally located within the reporting line of the areas 
under audit or when the auditor is assigned or takes on responsibilities that affect operations 
of the area under audit. 
 
The performance of nonaudit services must also be considered when assessing auditor 
independence. Specifically, auditors must apply the following two principles in regard to 
maintaining independence while performing nonaudit services for an audited program or 
entity: 
• Audit organizations must not provide nonaudit services that involve performing 
management functions or making management decisions; and  
• Audit organizations must not audit their own work or provide nonaudit services in 
situations in which the nonaudit services are significant or material to the subject matter 
of the audits.
