SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS 
The senior financial officers that must be covered by the company’s code of ethics include 
the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or 
controller, and persons performing similar functions. While the rules state that a company 
must have a specialized code of ethics that applies to senior financial officers, the company 
does not need to adopt a separate code of ethics for these officers. However, if it does not, 
the company’s general code of ethics should ex pressly state that it applies to all senior 
financial officers.
