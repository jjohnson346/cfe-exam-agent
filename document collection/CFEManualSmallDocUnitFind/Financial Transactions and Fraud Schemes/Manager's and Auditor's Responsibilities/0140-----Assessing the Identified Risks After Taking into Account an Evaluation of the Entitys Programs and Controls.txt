Assessing the Identified Risks After Taking into Account an Evaluation of the Entity’s Programs and Controls 
AU section 314 requires the auditor to obtain an understanding of each of the five 
components of internal controls sufficient to plan the audit. As part of this requirement, the 
auditor should evaluate whether the entity’s prog rams and controls that address identified 
risks of fraud have been suitably designed and placed in operation. These programs and 
controls may involve: 
• Specific controls designed to mitigate specific risks of fraud (e.g., controls to prevent 
misappropriation of particular, susceptible assets), and  
• Broader programs designed to prevent, deter, and detect fraud (e.g., ethics policies). 
 
Exhibit I of AU section 316 provides examples of programs and controls an entity might 
implement to create a culture of honesty and to prevent fraud (see also the chapter on 
“Fraud Prevention Programs” in the Fraud Prevention and Deterrence section of the Fraud 
Examiners Manual ).
