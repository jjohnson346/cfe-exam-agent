EVALUATING THE BUSINESS RATIONALE FOR SIGNIFICANT UNUSUAL TRANSACTIONS  
During the course of the audit, the auditor may become aware of significant transactions that 
are outside the normal course of the entity’s business or appear unusual given the auditor’s 
understanding of the entity’s operations. The auditor should gain an understanding of the 
business rationale for these transactions and whether the rationale (or lack thereof) suggests 
the transactions may have been entered into to engage in fraudulent financial reporting or to 
conceal misappropriation of assets. 
Some questions the auditor should consider include: 
• Are the transactions overly complex? 
• Has management discussed the transactions with the board of directors and audit 
committee? 
• Has management placed more emphasis on the need for a particular accounting 
treatment than on the underlying economics of the particular transaction? 
• Do the transactions involve unconsolidated, unrelated parties (including special purposes 
entities), or parties that do not have the substance or financial strength to support the 
transaction?
