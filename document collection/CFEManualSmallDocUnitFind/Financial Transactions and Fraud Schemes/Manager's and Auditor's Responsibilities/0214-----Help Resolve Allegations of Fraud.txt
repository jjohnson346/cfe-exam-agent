Help Resolve Allegations of Fraud 
Allegations of fraud often are based on insufficient evidence. They must be resolved through 
lawful evidence-gathering methods. The Certified Fraud Examiner Code of Professional 
Ethics requires Certified Fraud Examiners to assist in that resolution. The disposition of a 
case might be a settlement or some other form of agreement, rather than a trial and 
conviction or acquittal.
