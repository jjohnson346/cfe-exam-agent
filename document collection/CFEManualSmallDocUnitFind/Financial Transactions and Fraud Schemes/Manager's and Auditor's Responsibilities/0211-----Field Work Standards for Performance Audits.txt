Field Work Standards for Performance Audits 
The GAGAS field work standards for performance audits relate to planning the audit; 
supervising staff; obtaining sufficient, appropriate evidence; and preparing audit 
documentation: 
• Auditors must adequately plan and document the planning of the audit work. This 
includes assessing significance (defined as “the relative importance of a matter within the 
context in which it is being considered, including quantitative and qualitative factors”) 
and audit risk (defined as “the possibility that the auditors’ findings, conclusions, 
recommendations, or assurance may be improper or incomplete, as a result of factors 
such as evidence that is not sufficient and/or appropriate, an inadequate audit process, 
or intentional omissions or misleading information due to misrepresentation or fraud”) 
while defining the audit objectives, scope, and methodology. Additionally, as part of 
planning the engagement, auditors must: 
? Consider the nature and profile of the entity, as well as the needs of the users of the 
audit report; 
? Consider the entity’s internal control and information systems controls; 
? Consider all significant legal and regulatory requirements, contract provisions, grant 
agreements, and potential fraud and abuse affecting the audited entity;  
? Consider the results of previous audits and attestation engagements;  
? Identify potential criteria needed to evaluate the audit matters and potential sources 
of audit evidence based on the amount and type of evidence needed;  
? Consider relying on the work of other auditors and experts to help achieve audit 
objectives;  
? Assign staff and specialists with sufficient professional competence to perform the 
audit;  
? Identify other resources needed to complete the audit; 
? Communicate matters about the audit planning and performance to management 
officials; and  
? Prepare a written audit plan.

• Audit supervisors must properly supervise the audit staff, which involves providing 
guidance and direction to the staff, staying informed about significant problems 
encountered, reviewing the work performed, and providing effective on-the-job training. 
• Auditors must obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for 
the auditors’ findings, conclusions, and recommendations.  
• Auditors should prepare sufficiently detailed audit documentation to provide a clear 
understanding of the nature, timing, extent, and results of the work performed; the 
evidence obtained and its source; and the conclusions reached.
