Performance Audits 
Performance audits are described in the Yellow Book as audits that “provide assurance or 
conclusions based on an evaluation of sufficient, appropriate evidence against stated criteria, 
such as specific requirements, measures, or defined business practices.” The objectives of 
these audits can vary, and may include the assessment of program economy, efficiency, or 
effectiveness; internal control; compliance; and prospective analyses. Additionally, a 
performance audit may cover more than one of these objectives.
