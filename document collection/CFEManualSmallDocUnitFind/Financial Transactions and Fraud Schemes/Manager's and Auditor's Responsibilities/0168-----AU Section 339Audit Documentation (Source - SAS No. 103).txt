AU Section 339—Audit Documentation (Source: SAS No. 103) 
The ASB counterpart to PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 3 appears in the form of SAS No. 
103, Audit Documentation. SAS No. 103 supersedes SAS No. 96, Audit Documentation, as the 
guidance on audit documentation that applies to auditors of non-public entities. The 
standard is codified in AU section 339.  
 
In developing AU section 339, the ASB considered the provisions of PCAOB Auditing 
Standard No. 3; consequently, the requirements of the two standards are similar in many 
respects. Specifically, AU section 339 does the following:  
• Changes the date of the auditor’s report from the final day of fieldwork to the date on or 
after which the auditor obtained sufficient evidence to support the audit opinion;  
• Requires the audit documentation to be sufficient such that an experienced auditor with 
no previous connection to the audit could understand the work performed, the evidence 
obtained, and the conclusions reached;  
• Requires documentation of departures from generally accepted auditing standards, along 
with the justification and alternative procedures used; 
• Provides that oral explanations may be used to clarify or explain audit documentation, 
but alone are insufficient support for audit work; 
• Requires specific documentation of matters that the auditor identified as contradictory or 
inconsistent with the final audit conclusions, as well as how the auditor addressed such 
findings;  
• Instructs the auditor to assemble all of the audit documentation into the audit file within 
60 days following the audit report release date; 
• States that after 60 days following the audit report release date, workpapers may not be 
deleted, and all additions must be noted as such; and 
• Specifies a minimum retention period for audit documentation of five years from the 
report release date.
