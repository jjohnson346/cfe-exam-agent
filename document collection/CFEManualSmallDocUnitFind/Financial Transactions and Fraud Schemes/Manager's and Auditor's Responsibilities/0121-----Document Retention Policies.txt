Document Retention Policies 
Management of an organization should ensure that the organization has a proper and 
effective document retention policy (DRP) in place. When establishing a document retention 
policy, it is imperative that the organization consider all federal and state laws and 
regulations regarding record-keeping requirements. Industries such as health care, banking, 
and auditing contain trade-specific rules for documenting and retaining records. 
Furthermore, companies should continuously check for legal updates concerning these 
requirements. To have a document retention policy that ignores pertinent record-keeping 
requirements could lead to statutory violations. 
 
An effective document retention policy requires that a company (1) establish retention 
protocols before it foresees litigation or official investigation; (2) develop, review, and/or 
amend a policy for compliance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations; (3) 
ensure the reasonableness of the policy according to the company’s business practices; (4) 
provide a concise explanation of what is to be destroyed and when; (5) provide adequate 
protocols for management of electronic documents; and (6) clearly set forth when the policy 
should be immobilized due to a pending investigation or foreseeable litigation.

Because industries vary significantly in the types of documents produced, received, and 
distributed, courts lean toward a subjective “reasonableness” standard in determining 
whether a particular policy is adequate. Thus, each company must develop a policy that is 
specifically tailored to its business practices. A company may find it helpful to refer to 
retention policies of other companies for guidance, but should avoid duplicating such 
policies. By establishing individual business policies and compartmentalizing low-value and 
high-value documents, companies can gain quick access to internal documents. 
 
A properly planned and executed document retention policy will do little good if individuals 
within the company are unaware of it. Not only must employees be aware of the policy, they 
must also understand what is to be destroyed and when. 
 
While electronic communication continues to soar, companies struggle to catch up with its 
agility. It is vital that companies include protocols for preserving and destroying electronic 
documents. Companies with information technology (IT) departments should develop 
procedures for handling electronic data. Company counsels, executives, and managers 
should be aware of how electronic data is stored and destroyed. For example, an e-mail 
deleted by an employee may remain in a company’s computer systems until an administrator 
permanently deletes it. Such situations must be recognized and addressed when designing a 
document retention policy.
