PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT 
The auditor must use professional judgment, including exercising professional skepticism 
and reasonable care, in planning, performing, and reporting the results of the audit or 
attestation engagement. In applying professional judgment, it is imperative that the auditor 
retain an attitude of professional skepticism, assuming that management is neither inherently 
honest nor inherently dishonest. Thus, auditors must approach the engagement with a 
questioning mind and a critical assessment of all evidence. The application of professional 
judgment also requires auditors to use their professional knowledge, skills, and experience to 
diligently gather information and objectively evaluate the sufficiency and appropriateness of 
evidence.
