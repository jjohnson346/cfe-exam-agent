Obtaining Information Needed to Identify Risks of Material Misstatements Due to Fraud 
AU section 314, Understanding the Entity and Its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material 
Misstatement, provides guidance on how the auditor obtains knowledge about the entity and 
its environment, including its internal control. As part of that process, the auditor should 
perform the following procedures to obtain information to use in identifying the risks of 
material misstatement due to fraud: 
• Make inquiries of management and others within the entity to obtain their views on the 
risks of fraud and how those risks are addressed; 
• Consider any unusual or unexpected relationships that have been identified in 
performing analytical procedures in planning the audit; 
• Consider whether one or more fraud risk factors exist; and 
• Consider other information that may be helpful in the identification of risks of material 
misstatement due to fraud.
