USING A TOP-DOWN APPROACH 
In an audit of ICOFR, auditors should implement a top-down approach. According to 
Auditing Standard No. 5, a top-down approach “begins at the financial statement level and 
with the auditor’s understanding of the over all risks to internal control over financial 
reporting. The auditor then focuses on entity-level controls and works down to significant 
accounts and disclosures and their relevant assertions.” (Paragraph 21) This approach 
focuses auditors on those accounts, disclosures, and assertions that are most likely to result 
in material misstatement of the company’s financial statements. The standard makes explicit 
mention, however, that this approach describes the auditor’s thought process when 
identifying risks and the controls to test, rather than the order in which the auditor should 
perform the audit procedures.
