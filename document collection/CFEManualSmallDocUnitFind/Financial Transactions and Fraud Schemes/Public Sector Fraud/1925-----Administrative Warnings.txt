Administrative Warnings 
The official should be advised of his obligation to cooperate via the agency’s so-called 
“administrative warning,” which will read similar to the following:   
 
Under [the applicable agency policies and procedures manual] you are required to disclose 
any information in your possession pertaining to the matter under investigation and answer 
any proper questions asked of you. 
 
You may be subject to disciplinary action for your failure or refusal to answer proper 
questions relating to the performance of your duties as an employee. You may also be subject 
to criminal prosecution for any false answer that you give to any such questions. Do you 
understand this?
