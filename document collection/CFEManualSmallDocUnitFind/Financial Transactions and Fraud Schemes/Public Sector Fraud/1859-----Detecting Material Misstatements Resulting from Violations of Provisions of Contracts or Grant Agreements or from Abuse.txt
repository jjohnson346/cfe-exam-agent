Detecting Material Misstatements Resulting from Violations of Provisions of Contracts or Grant Agreements or from Abuse 
4.10 Auditors should design the audit to provide reasonable assurance of detecting 
misstatements that result from violations of provisions of contracts or grant 
agreements and could have a direct and material effect on the determination of 
financial statement amounts or other financial data significant to the audit objectives.

4.11  If specific information comes to the auditors’ attention that provides evidence 
concerning the existence of possible violations of provisions of contracts or grant 
agreements that could have a material indirect effect on the financial statements, the 
auditors should apply audit procedures specifically directed to ascertaining whether 
such violations have occurred. When the auditors conclude that a violation of 
provisions of contracts or grant agreements has or is likely to have occurred, they 
should determine the effect on the financial statements as well as the implications for 
other aspects of the audit. 
4.12  Abuse involves behavior that is deficient or improper when compared with behavior 
that a prudent person would consider reasonable and necessary business practice 
given the facts and circumstances. Abuse also includes misuse of authority or 
position for personal financial interests or those of an immediate or close family 
member or business associate. Abuse does not necessarily involve fraud, violation of 
laws, regulations, or provisions of a contract or grant agreement. 
4.13 If during the course of the audit, auditors become aware of abuse that could be 
quantitatively or qualitatively material to the financial statements, auditors should 
apply audit procedures specifically directed to ascertain the potential effect on the 
financial statements or other financial data significant to the audit objectives. After 
performing additional work, auditors may discover that the abuse represents 
potential fraud or illegal acts. Because the determination of abuse is subjective, 
auditors are not required to provide reasonable assurance of detecting abuse.
