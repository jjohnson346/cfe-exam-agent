5.15  Under AICPA standards and GAGAS, auditors have responsibilities for detecting 
fraud and illegal acts that have a material effect on the financial statements and 
determining whether those charged with governance are adequately informed about 
fraud and illegal acts. GAGAS include additional reporting standards. When auditors 
conclude, based on sufficient, appropriate evidence, that any of the following either 
has occurred or is likely to have occurred, they should include in their audit report 
the relevant information about 
a. Fraud and illegal acts that have an effect on the financial statements that is more 
than inconsequential,

b. Fraud and illegal acts that have an effect on the financial statements that is more 
than inconsequential, determination of financial statement amounts or other 
financial data significant to the audit, and 
c. Abuse that is material, either quantitatively or qualitatively. 
5.16  When auditors detect violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements or 
abuse that have an effect on the financial statements that is less than material but 
more than inconsequential, they should communicate those findings in writing to 
officials of the audited entity. Determining whether and how to communicate to 
officials of the audited entity fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts 
or grant agreements, or abuse that is inconsequential is a matter of professional 
judgment. Auditors should document such communications. 
5.17 When fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or 
abuse either have occurred or are likely to have occurred, auditors may consult with 
authorities or legal counsel about whether publicly reporting such information would 
compromise investigative or legal proceedings. Auditors may limit their public 
reporting to matters that would not compromise those proceedings, and for 
example, report only on information that is already a part of the public record.
