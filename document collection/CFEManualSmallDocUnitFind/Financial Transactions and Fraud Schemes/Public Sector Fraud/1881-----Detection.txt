Detection 
The ultimate detection method for false statements is the examination of source documents. 
This auditing approach is called “tracing” or “inside-out,” that is, from the source document 
out to the report or financial statement. 
 
However, the auditor might be alerted to the possibility of false statements if any of the 
following red flags are present:
