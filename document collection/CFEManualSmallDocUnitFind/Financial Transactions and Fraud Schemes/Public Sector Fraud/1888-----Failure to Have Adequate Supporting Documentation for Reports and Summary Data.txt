Failure to Have Adequate Supporting Documentation for Reports and Summary Data 
For supporting documentation to be adequate, it must be sufficient, competent, and relevant. 
In addition, the auditor must apply common sense to the source document. For example, are 
the amounts too high or too low, do they include odd times, places, and/or people? 
 
These are all indicators that there might be false statements. Therefore, these red flags might 
alert the auditor to select a larger sample of source documents for examination.
