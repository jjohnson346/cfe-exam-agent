Fictitious Transactions 
 
EXAMPLE 
A former supervisory accountant in the Environmental Protection Agency pled guilty to 
defrauding the EPA of $28,000. She admitted that she entered false information into the 
EPA’s Integrated Financial Management System resulting in her receiving 23 U.S. 
Treasury checks, which she later deposited into her credit union account. After receiving the 
funds, she made entries into the financial reporting system to balance the accounts.
