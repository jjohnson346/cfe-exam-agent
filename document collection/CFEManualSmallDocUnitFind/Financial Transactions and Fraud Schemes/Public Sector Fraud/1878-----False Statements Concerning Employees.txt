False Statements Concerning Employees 
 
EXAMPLE 
A meat packing company in Nebraska pled guilty to Social Security number misuse, 
Social Security benefits fraud, harboring aliens, and filing false employment documents. The 
company was fined $103,000. The settlement came after federal agents raided the plant, 
arresting more than 300 people. Of those arrested, most agreed to deportation without 
hearings. The company admitted to harboring aliens, but it claimed that illegal workers 
were never hired knowingly.
