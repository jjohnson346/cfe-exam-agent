Rules of Procedure 
Those who interview high officials must avoid extremes of procedure and should, as a 
general rule, neither act overly belligerent nor kowtow to them. Basic rules of procedure in 
the areas of warnings and representation apply to these people as much as to the general 
population of public employees. What is different is the high official’s ability to influence 
others and their particular susceptibility to embarrassing publicity, and a good interviewer 
will turn these traits to his own advantage in his quest for a truthful recitation of what did in 
fact occur.
