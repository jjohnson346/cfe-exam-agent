The Department of Defense (DoD) 
This department, long notorious for its waste and abuse, has dramatically increased its fraud 
detection and prevention efforts in recent years. A full complement of auditors and 
investigators are assigned to detect and prevent fraud. Contract officers are trained to 
recognize and required to promptly report any possibly fraudulent situations. Major 
government contractors are assigned a DoD auditor who works on-site, increasing the 
chances of possible procurement fraud being reported. The measures taken to combat fraud 
in this agency have proven quite effective, with increased prosecution and recovery. 
 
Within the DoD, several investigative agencies exist:  
• Defense Criminal Investigative Service 
• Air Force Office of Special Investigations  
• Army Criminal Investigation Command 
• Naval Criminal Investigative Services 
 
In addition to their other investigative duties, each of these agencies pursues fraud cases 
involving military personnel, civilian employees, and contractors.
