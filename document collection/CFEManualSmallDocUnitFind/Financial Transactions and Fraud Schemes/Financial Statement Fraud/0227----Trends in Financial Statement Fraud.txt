Trends in Financial Statement Fraud 
Financial statement fraud is estimated to comprise about 10 percent of all occupational 
frauds. According to the ACFE’s 2010 Report to the Nations on  Occupational Fraud a nd Abuse, 
fraudulent statements comprised 4.8 percent of the frauds reported in the study, with a 
median loss of $4,100,000. However, it is im portant to note that quoted losses resulting 
from financial statement fraud are often measuring lost market capitalization or lost 
shareholder value rather than direct loss of financial assets. This does not make the scheme 
any less harmful; in fact, the lost shareholder value resulting from financial statement fraud 
can have crippling effects on even the largest companies, as we have seen with high-profile

frauds such as the Enron and WorldCom scandals. It can also have a tremendous impact on 
the organization’s shareholders. 
 
Similar results came out of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) study required 
under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). The agen cy was charged with reviewing incidents of 
financial statement fraud in the five years prior to passage of the legislation. From July 31, 
1997 through July 30, 2002, the SEC filed 51 5 enforcement actions for financial reporting 
and disclosure violations arising out of 227 Division of Enforcement investigations 
(enforcement matters). The 515 actions included 869 named parties, consisting of 164 
entities and 705 individuals. The year-over-year numbers reveal the growing problem of 
financial reporting violations during the study period.

Most of the actions involved improper revenue recognition. In 126 of the 227 enforcement 
matters, management reported fictitious sales, improperly timed revenue recognition, or 
improperly valued revenue. Another 101 enforcement matters involved improper expense 
recognition, including improper capitalization or deferral of expenses; improper use of 
reserves; or other understatements of expenses. Additionally, 23 enforcement matters 
involved improper accounting for business combinations. And 137 enforcement matters 
involved other accounting and reporting issues, such as inadequate Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) disclosure and improper use of off-balance sheet 
arrangements. (See the following chart. Note:  The sum of the numbers in the second 
column is greater than the total number of 227 because most of the actions involved more 
than one type of improper conduct.)

The SEC study revealed further proof of management’s involvement in financial statement 
fraud. In these enforcement matters, charges were brought against 75 chairmen of the board, 
111 chief executive officers (CEOs), 111 presidents, 105 chief financial officers (CFOs), 21 
chief operating officers (COOs), 16 chief accounting officers (CAOs), and 27 vice presidents 
(VPs) of finance.  
 
Studies by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO)—formerly known as the 
General Accounting Office—also revealed compar able trends in financial statement fraud. 
In July 2006, the GAO issued an update to its 2002 report, Financial Statement Restatements: 
Trends, Market Impacts, Regulatory Responses, and Remaining Challenges. The original report was 
based on the GAO’s analysis of 689 of 919 financial statement restatements occurring from 
January 1, 1997 through June 30, 2002. To update the information in the original, the GAO 
undertook a similar analysis of 1,390 public company restatements that occurred between 
January 1, 2002 and September 30, 2005. The following are some of the findings of the two 
studies:  
• The percentage of publicly traded companies announcing restatements increased from 
less than one percent in 1997 to over three percent by the end of 2002. This percentage 
rose again, to 6.8 percent, by September of 2005.  
• The quantity of restatements resulting from accounting irregularities grew from 92 in 
1997 to 314 in 2002, or approximately 241 percent. In the first 9 months of 2005 
(through September 30), there were 523 restatements announced, which amounted to an 
increase of approximately 67 percent from 2002 and more than 468 percent from 1997.

• The average size of a company restating its financial statements increased from $500 
million in 1997 to $2 billion in 2002. By September 30, 2005, the average market 
capitalization of a company announcing a restatement had grown to $6 billion. 
• Cost and expense issues were the most common reason for restatements between July 
2002 and September 2005. These restatements, which include over- or understating costs 
or expenses, improper classification of costs, and other misreporting of costs, accounted 
for over 35 percent of restatements examined during that period. In the 2002 study, cost 
and expense issues were the second most common reason for restatement, comprising 
16 percent of all restatements.  
• Twenty percent of the restatements analyzed in the 2006 study were due to revenue 
recognition issues, making this the second most common reason for restatement during 
the period studied. This represents a decline from the 2002 study in which revenue 
recognition was the most common reason for restatement, comprising 38 percent of the 
population. Revenue recognition restatements include recognizing revenue sooner or 
later than allowed under GAAP or recognizing questionable or fictitious revenue. 
 
Today, financial statement and accounting fraud cases continue to be the single largest 
category of SEC actions filed. Many relate to the subprime mortgage market, and another 
large group relate to executive compensation. Most notably, the SEC filed civil suits 
expanding the scope of substantive claims and remedies, aggressively applying the 
"clawback" provision of Section 304 of the Sa rbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and alleging false 
disclosures of non-GAAP financial metrics in violation of Regulation G. 
 
In the summer of 2010, COSO issued the Fraudulent Financial Reporting 1998-2 0 0 7 : An 
Analysis of U.S. Public Companies.  Highlights of the report are as follows: 
• 347 companies were involved in alleged incidents of financial statement fraud during the 
10 year period. 
• Seventy-two percent of the cases named the CEO, and 65 percent named the CFO as 
being associated with the fraud. 
• The average fraud lasted 31.4 months, with the median fraud lasting 24 months. 
• Virtually all of the firms received an un qualified audit opinion on the last set of 
fraudulently misstated financial statements. 
• Twenty percent of the frauds of public companies occurred in the computer 
hardware/software industry.  Manufacturing also represented 20 percent of the frauds. 
• Improper revenue recognition occurred 61 percent of the fraud methods. Overstatement 
of assets occurred in 51 percent of the cases. Understatement of liabilities/expenses

occurred in 31 percent of the cases.  Insider trading was cited in 24 percent of the cases 
as well.
