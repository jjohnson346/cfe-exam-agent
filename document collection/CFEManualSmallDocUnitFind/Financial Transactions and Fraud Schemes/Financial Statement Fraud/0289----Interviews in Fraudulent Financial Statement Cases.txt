Interviews in Fraudulent Financial Statement Cases 
For in-depth interviewing techniques, please refer to the “Interview Theory and 
Application” chapter in the Investigation section of the Fraud Examiners Manual. 
 
Financial statement fraud does not occur in an isolated environment. People in organizations 
who have both motive and opportunity are the prime candidates to commit fraudulent 
misstatement. In the overwhelming majority of situations, two key managers participate

become involved largely out of necessity. Those who are not directly involved most often 
are not aware that anything is wrong.  
 
Investigations of financial statement frauds are unique in that they almost always involve 
interviewing the executive management of the organization. To detect or deter financial 
statement fraud, it is absolutely necessary that top management be interviewed by a 
competent and experienced fraud examiner who possesses the ability to solicit honest 
answers to tough — but vital— questions about whether anyone has tampered with the books.
