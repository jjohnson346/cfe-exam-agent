Accounts Receivable  
Accounts receivable are subject to manipulation in the same manner as sales and inventory, 
and in many cases, the schemes are conducted together. The two most common schemes 
involving accounts receivable are fictitious receivables and failure to write off accounts 
receivable as bad debts (or failure to establish an adequate allowance for bad debts). 
Fictitious receivables commonly arise from fictitious revenues, which were discussed earlier. 
Accounts receivable should be reported at net realizable value, that is, the amount of the 
receivable less the amount expected not to be collected.
