EXPENSING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 
Just as capitalizing expenses is improper, so is expensing costs that should be capitalized. 
The organization may want to minimize its net income due to tax considerations, or to 
increase earnings in future periods. Expensing an item that should be depreciated over a 
period of time helps to accomplish just that—net income is lower and, therefore, so are 
taxes.
