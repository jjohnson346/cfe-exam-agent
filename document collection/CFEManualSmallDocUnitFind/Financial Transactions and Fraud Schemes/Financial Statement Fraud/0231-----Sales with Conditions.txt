Sales with Conditions  
Sales with conditions are those that have terms that have not been completed and the rights 
and risks of ownership have not passed to the purchaser. They do not qualify for recording 
as revenue. These types of sales are similar to schemes involving the recognition of revenue 
in improper periods, since the conditions for sale may become satisfied in the future, at 
which point revenue recognition would become appropriate. The recognition of revenue in 
improper periods is discussed further in the next section.
