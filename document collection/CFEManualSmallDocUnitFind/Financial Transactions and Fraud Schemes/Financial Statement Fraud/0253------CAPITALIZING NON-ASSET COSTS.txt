Financial Statement Fraud

CAPITALIZING NON-ASSET COSTS 
Excluded from the cost of a purchased asset are interest and finance charges incurred in the 
purchase. For example, when a company finances a capital equipment purchase, monthly 
payments include both principal liability reduction and interest payments. On initial 
purchase, only the original cost of the asset should be capitalized. The subsequent interest 
payments should be charged to interest expense and not to the asset. Without a reason for 
intensive review, fraud of this type can go unchecked.
