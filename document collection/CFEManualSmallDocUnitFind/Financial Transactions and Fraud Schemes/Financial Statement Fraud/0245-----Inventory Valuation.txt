Inventory Valuation 
Inventory should be recorded at the lower of cost or market value. This means that 
inventory must be valued at its acquisition cost, except when the cost is determined to be 
higher than the current market value, in which case it should be written down to its current 
value, or written off altogether if it has no value. Failing to write down inventory results in 
overstated assets and the mismatching of cost of goods sold with revenues. Other methods 
by which inventory can be improperly stated include manipulation of the physical inventory 
count, inflation of the unit costs used to price out inventory, and failure to relieve inventory 
for the costs of goods sold. Fictitious inventory schemes usually involve the creation of fake 
documents, such as inventory count sheets and receiving reports. Companies have even 
programmed special computer reports of inventory for auditors that incorrectly added up 
the line item values so as to inflate the overall inventory balance. Computer-assisted audit 
techniques can significantly help auditors to detect many of these inventory fraud 
techniques. 
 
In some instances, friendly coconspirators claim to be holding inventory for companies in 
question. Other times, companies falsely report large values of inventory in transit (perhaps 
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean), knowing that the auditors will have a difficult time 
observing it. “Bill and hold” items that have already been recorded as sales might be 
included in the physical inventory count, as might goods owned by third parties but held by 
companies on consignment or for storage. Companies have even made up pallets of 
inventory with hollow centers, placed bricks in sealed boxes instead of high value products, 
and shuttled inventory overnight between locations being observed by auditors on different 
days so as to double count the inventory. Finally, it is also common for companies to insert 
phony count sheets during the inventory observation or change the quantities on the  
count sheets.
