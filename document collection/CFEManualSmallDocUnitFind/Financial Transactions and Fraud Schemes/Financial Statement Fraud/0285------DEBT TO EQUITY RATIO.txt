DEBT TO EQUITY RATIO  
The debt to equity ratio is computed by dividing total 
liabilities by total equity. This ratio is one that is heavily 
considered by lending institutions. It provides a clear picture of the relative risk assumed by 
the creditors and owners. The higher the ratio, the more difficult it will be for the owners to 
raise capital by increasing long-term debt. Debt to equity requirements are often included as 
borrowing covenants in corporate lending agreements. The example displays a very 
favorable Year One ratio of 0.89. Year Two, however, shows a ratio of 1.84, which indicates 
that debt is greatly increasing. In this case, the increase in the ratio corresponds with the rise 
in accounts payable. Sudden changes in this ratio may signal an examiner to look for fraud.
