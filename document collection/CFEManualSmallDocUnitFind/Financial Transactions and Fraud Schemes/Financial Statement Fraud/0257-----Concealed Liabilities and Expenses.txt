Concealed Liabilities and Expenses 
Understating liabilities and expenses is one of the ways financial statements can be 
manipulated to make a company appear more profitable than it actually is. Because pre-tax 
income will increase by the full amount of the expense or liability not recorded, this financial 
statement fraud method can have a significant impact on reported earnings with relatively 
little effort by the fraudster. It is much easier to commit than falsifying sales transactions. 
Missing transactions can also be harder for auditors to detect than improperly recorded ones 
since the missing transactions leave no audit trail. 
 
There are three common methods for concealing liabilities and expenses:  
• Liability/expense omissions 
• Capitalized expenses 
• Failure to disclose warranty costs and liabilities
