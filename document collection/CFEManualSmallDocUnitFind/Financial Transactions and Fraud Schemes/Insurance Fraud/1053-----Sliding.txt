Sliding 
Sliding is the term used for including additional coverages in the insurance policy without the 
knowledge of the insured. The extra charges are hidden in the total premium and since the 
insured is unaware of the coverage, few claims are ever filed. For example, motor club 
memberships, accidental death, and travel accident coverages can usually be slipped into the 
policy without the knowledge of the insured.
