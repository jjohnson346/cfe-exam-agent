THE CAPPER 
Cappers, also known as runners or steerers, are used to recruit patients for the scheme. They 
may be employed by either the attorney or doctor and are paid, either on a percentage of the 
total take or on a per person basis, for bringing in patients. Cappers may approach patients 
at unemployment compensation lines, work sites, scenes of accidents, or at any other types 
of organized gatherings. With promises of enrichment, patients are brought into the scheme. 
 
EXAMPLE 
In August of 2010, the last member of a group of 51 suspects in Miami, Florida was 
arrested for insurance fraud and other crimes. The insurance fraud included clinic workers 
and owners who hired runners to recruit auto accident victims, as well as staged auto 
accident participants when they ran out of “legitimate” accident victims. Runners received 
$500 to $700 per patient, and the estimated fraudulent claims from this scheme exceeded 
$4 million.
