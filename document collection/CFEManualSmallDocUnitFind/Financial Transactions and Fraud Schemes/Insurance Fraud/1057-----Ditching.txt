Ditching 
Ditching, also known as owner give-ups, is getting rid of a vehicle to cash in on an insurance 
policy or to settle an outstanding loan. The vehicle is normally expensive and purchased with 
a small down payment. The vehicle is reported stolen, although in some cases, the owner just 
abandons the vehicle hoping that it is stolen, stripped for parts, or taken to a pound and 
destroyed. The scheme sometimes involves homeowner’s insurance for the property that 
was “stolen” in the vehicle.
