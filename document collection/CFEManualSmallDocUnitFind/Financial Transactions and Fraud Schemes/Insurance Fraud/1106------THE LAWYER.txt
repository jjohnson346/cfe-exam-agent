THE LAWYER 
Lawyers are usually the organizers of the schemes and the ones who will profit the most. 
The majority of workers’ compensation cases are accepted on a contingency fee basis. If no 
settlement is awarded, then the lawyers will not be paid. This is a high volume business, and 
the lawyers do not want the cases to be litigated. They are relying on the insurance 
company’s desire to settle as quickly as possible.  
 
The lawyers will entice the claimant into securing their services by promising a large 
settlement from the insurance company. The claimants may or may not have to undergo the 
medical tests, since the only requirement of the claimants is that they be insured. The lawyer 
will then refer the injured party to a doctor for “treatment.”
