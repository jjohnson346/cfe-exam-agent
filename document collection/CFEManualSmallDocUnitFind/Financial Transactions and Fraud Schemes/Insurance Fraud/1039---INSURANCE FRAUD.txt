INSURANCE FRAUD 
 
The insurance business, by its very nature, is susceptible to fraud. Insurance is a risk 
distribution system that requires the accumulation of liquid assets in the form of reserve 
funds, which are in turn available to pay loss claims. Insurance companies generate a large 
steady flow of cash through insurance premiums. Steady cash flow is an important economic 
resource that is very attractive and easily diverted. Large accumulations of liquid assets make 
insurance companies attractive for take over  and loot schemes. Insurance companies are under 
great pressure to maximize the return on investing the reserve funds, thus making them 
vulnerable to high yielding investment schemes.
