Settlement Checks 
Company employees can misdirect settlement checks such as Matured Endowment, Paid 
Up, etc., to the branch office, to their homes, or to fictitious addresses. The employee can 
easily create a check defalcation by changing the address of record prior to the settlement 
check issue date, thus misdirecting the check in question. Also, periodically an orphan 
contract holder might be transferred to his agency affording the opportunity to improperly 
request the issuance of a settlement check. 
 
An orphan contract holder is a policyholder or contract holder who has not been assigned to a 
servicing agent or the whereabouts of this individual is unknown. The servicing agent 
attempts to locate this family group and can possibly influence them to purchase  
additional insurance. 
 
A clerical support employee might receive notification that the orphan contract holder does 
not reside at the given address. This will give the support staffer an opportunity to change 
the address to either his home or a fictitious address and possibly create a fraud.
