Verifiers 
Next, the caller is passed to a verifier, who reads some vague words about the deal and 
records the person’s agreement. These recordings are intentionally vague, leaving out the 
pitch and key details, essentially recording only the customer’s consent. Verifiers also stall 
customers who call back to complain (heat calls), finding reasons why a little more patience 
will solve the problem, and in some cases, convincing the person to send a little more money 
to help the process along.
