Scavenger or Revenge Scheme    
This involves the company that initially conned the consumer. Using a different company’s 
name, the outfit contacts the consumer again and asks if he would like to help put the 
unethical company out of business and get his money back. Naturally, an up-front fee is 
required to finance the investigation.
