International Calls 
An off-shore version of the 900 number scam uses international phone companies to reap 
big dollars. Callers believe they are dialing an international number for free information, 
usually about travel contests, discount fares, or overseas jobs. But the phone numbers, in 
Guyana and the Caribbean, charge up to $2.30 per minute for a recorded message that runs 
for 15 minutes. The promoters get a kickback from the phone company; in one case, 37 
cents per minute went to the scammers.
