International Factoring Companies 
Factoring through Asian and European merchants is becoming increasingly common. 
Factoring companies in these countries tend to charge a lower price for their services than 
some other countries—between nine and 10 percent of the gross. Regardless of their locale, 
factors have the opportunity to make a great profit. They also, however, face the risk that 
banks will freeze their accounts or sue them for excessive chargebacks. In response to the 
losses suffered at the hands of dishonest telemarketers, banks and credit card companies 
have started reviewing their accounts to locate those businesses with inordinate numbers of 
chargebacks. The financial institution closes these accounts, and may file suit if the account 
holder can be located.
