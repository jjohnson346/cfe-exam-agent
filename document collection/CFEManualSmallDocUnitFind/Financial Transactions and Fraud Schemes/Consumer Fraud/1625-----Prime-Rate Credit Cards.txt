Prime-Rate Credit Cards 
In this scam, telemarketing companies assure customers they can get major cards for a small 
fee even if their credit report is poor. Victims receive an application for a MasterCard, which 
they could obtain in any department store. Telemarketers also push secured cards, which 
require a cash deposit (usually a $250–$300 minimum) to the issuer’s bank to activate  
the card.
