Required Payment 
The franchisee is required to pay the franchiser. These payments usually include initial 
franchise fees and ongoing royalties that are calculated as a percentage of sales, net of sales 
tax. Another typical fee is a transfer fee that is applicable on the sale of a franchise. 
 
Fraud in franchising may occur at each stage of the franchise relationship, creating 
disclosure, relationship, and termination issues.
