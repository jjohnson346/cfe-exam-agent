Success Rates 
Another important disclosure issue is a franchiser’s claim that “X” percent (usually a high 
percentage) of its stores have been successful; in other words, they have remained in 
continuous operation from opening day to the present. But the franchise salesperson may 
not have told the franchisee that a number of stores were sold many times and in each sale 
the old franchisee sold the store back to the franchiser who re-sold it to a new franchisee. 
Would that additional information be material to the prospective franchisee? Would failure 
to disclose that information amount to fraud?  
 
The FTC rule does not require franchisers to disclose re-sales or turnovers from one 
franchisee to the next.
