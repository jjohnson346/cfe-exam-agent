What to Do If Your Identity Is Stolen 
• Start keeping detailed records. 
• File a police report with your local law enforcement agency and keep a copy of that 
report. Many banks and credit agencies require such a report before they will 
acknowledge that a theft has occurred.

• If your wallet or purse is stolen, immediately cancel your credit and debit cards and get 
replacements. Put a “stop payment” on all lost or stolen checks. 
• Report unauthorized charges and accounts to the appropriate credit issuers and credit 
bureaus immediately by phone and in writing. Change account numbers or close all 
accounts that are affected by the fraudulent activity. 
• Check for and repair further breaches of your identity. 
• Notify law enforcement agencies: 
? Federal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov) 
? Federal Bureau of Investigation (www.fbi.gov) 
? Local and state agencies 
• Contact the three primary credit reporting bureaus to have a security alert or freeze 
placed on your report, and request a copy of your credit report and review it for 
unauthorized account activity: 
? Equifax (800) 525-6285 or (888) 766-0008 
? Experian (formerly TRW) (888) 397-3742 
? Trans Union (800) 680-7289
