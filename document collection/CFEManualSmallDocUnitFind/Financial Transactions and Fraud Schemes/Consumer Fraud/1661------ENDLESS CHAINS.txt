ENDLESS CHAINS 
The most outrageous pyramid scams don’t bother to hide their stripes. They don’t use 
services or products to establish their legitimacy. Instead they use the “chain letter” 
approach. The recipient of the letter sends a sum of money ($5, $50, $100, the amount varies 
but isn’t usually very large) to the person who mailed them the letter, then passes the letter 
on to three or four others.  
 
Probability studies have shown that 93 to 95 percent of the players in a pyramid (everyone 
but those at the earliest initiation) will lose most of their money. Fully half can expect to lose 
everything they put in.  
 
Some Internet chains have become known as “administered” pyramid schemes — every 
exchange in the chain is monitored by a central administrator, who makes sure everybody’s 
playing (and paying) along. The administrator takes a cut of each transaction.
