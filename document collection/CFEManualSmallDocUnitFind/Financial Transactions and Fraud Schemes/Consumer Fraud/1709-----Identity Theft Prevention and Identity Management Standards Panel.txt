Identity Theft Prevention and Identity Management Standards Panel 
In September 2006, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Better 
Business Bureau (BBB) established the Identity Theft Prevention and Identity Management Standards 
Panel (IDSP) 4 as a cross-sector initiative to catalog existing standards related to identity theft 
prevention and to identify areas where additional standards and best practices are needed to 
help businesses and other organizations further prevent identity fraud. In January 2008, the 
IDSP released a two-volume report providing a detailed inventory of standards and best 
practices that can be used to prevent identity theft and a number of recommendations for 
security enhancements around the issuance of identity credentials and the exchange and 
maintenance of identity data. The ANSI-BBB IDSP Report, available for downloading at no 
charge at www.ansi.org/idsp, is a useful tool for businesses, government agencies, and other 
organizations that wish to evaluate and augment their current identity theft prevention and 
identity management practices.
