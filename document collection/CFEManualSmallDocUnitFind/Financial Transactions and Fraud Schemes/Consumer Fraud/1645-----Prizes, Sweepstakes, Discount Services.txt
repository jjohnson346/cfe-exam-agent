the receiver they have already won a prize. A new luxury vehicle tops the list, along with

$5,000 in cash, a diamond necklace, a living room set, and $500 in gift certificates for 
clothing and household furnishings. The odds of winning any of the prizes are astronomical. 
Victims are given trinkets or coupons redeemable only for the company’s own  
shoddy merchandise. 
 
Winners who call back are often asked to stipulate how they intend to spend their winnings 
for the company’s “records,” or for “publicity materials.” Then they will be asked to pay a 
processing fee or to prepay the taxes on their winnings. Sometimes winners pay immediately 
by dialing a 900 number that charges them for a 10-minute call even if they hang up 
immediately. This practice is a further violation of telemarketing laws, which require a toll 
number to disconnect within 30 seconds after the caller hangs up.
