Factoring Companies 
Telemarketing operations also commonly engage factoring companies. These groups buy 
credit card receipts from telemarketing concerns at a discount, then use their merchant bank 
accounts to convert the receipts into cash. Some factors charge as much as 30 percent of the 
receipts’ gross value to launder the slips. Factoring is illegal in some states, though crooks 
find ways to slip through loopholes or disguise their alliances.
