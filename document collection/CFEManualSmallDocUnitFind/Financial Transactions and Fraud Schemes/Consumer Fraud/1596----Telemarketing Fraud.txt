Telemarketing Fraud 
Victims of telemarketing fraud are swindled out of more than $40 billion a year. According 
to one survey, 92 percent of U.S. adults say they have received postcards or letters promising 
they had “definitely” been awarded a “guaranteed” prize. Of those responding, 69 percent 
never received the promised prizes. Telemarketers select victims deliberately, targeting the 
elderly and the unemployed. Over 5.5 million Americans said they had bought items by 
telephone in the past two years and were exploited in the process. 
 
While the telephone, newspaper, and postal service used to be the key tools of telemarketers, 
the Internet has afforded fraudsters a more fast paced and anonymous method of carrying 
out their schemes. The number one scam to be currently found on the Internet, says the 
National Consumer League’s Fraud Watch (NCL), is the fake check scam, in which 
consumers are paid with a phony check for work or items sold and are instructed to wire 
money back. This has been the number one ranking telemarketing fraud for two years 
running. Advance fee scams and phishing also rank in the top 10 schemes on the World 
Wide Web. A discussion of some of the specific Internet schemes can be found in the 
“Computer and Internet Fraud” chapter in the Financial Transactions section of the Fraud 
Examiners Manual. 
 
Telemarketing offenses are classified as consumer fraud, yet many businesses are affected by 
office supply and marketing services scams. The hit-and-run nature of phone rooms, the 
geographical distances between the crooks and their victims, and the resources and priorities 
of law enforcement agencies all make enforcement efforts difficult. Only about one in 100 
victims ever files a complaint.
