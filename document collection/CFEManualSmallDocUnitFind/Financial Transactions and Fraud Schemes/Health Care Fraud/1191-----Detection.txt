Detection 
Procedures can help identify altered claims include: 
• Analyzing charges and identifying any excessive claims for prescription or medical 
services above an acceptable level. 
• Looking for any alterations, erasures, changes of  ink, or white-outs on the original bill 
prior to paying the claim. This is important in today’s environment in which original 
bills, checks, and other documents are destroyed as soon as they are microfilmed to 
minimize storage space for record keeping.  
• Training adjusters to look for obvious alterations when processing claims.
