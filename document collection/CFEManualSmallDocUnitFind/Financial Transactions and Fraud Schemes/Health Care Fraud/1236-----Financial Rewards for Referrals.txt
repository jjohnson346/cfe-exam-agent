Financial Rewards for Referrals 
Many facilities are dependent on outside sources of patient referrals such as physicians or 
other clinicians. This dependence has led some hospitals to develop economic relationships 
in order to obtain referrals: 
• Rewarding clinicians who refer patients by referring patients who need outpatient 
treatment to those clinicians. 
• Allowing allied health professionals who refer patients to provide therapy for their own 
patients at the hospital; while nonreferring allied professionals are not allowed to use  
the hospital. 
• Paying medical directors or other physicians an incentive bonus linked to the overall 
profitability of the hospital. 
• Paying a physician who is under contract to the hospital but who provides no services.
