Failure to Give “Fee Breaks” 
An insurance company may be guilty of fraud if it fails to pass on fee breaks it negotiates 
with its providers. The alleged overcharging occurs when an insurance company negotiates a 
discount on a medical bill. If the company does not pass along the discount, the consumer’s 
co-payment is made on the full price rather than the discounted price, and the consumer 
ends up paying a higher percentage of their bill than they should. For example, if a bill is 
$1,000 and a 50 percent discount is negotiated, the consumer’s 20 percent portion should 
equal $100. If the company does not pass along the discount, the consumer pays 20 percent 
of the full $1,000, or $200.
