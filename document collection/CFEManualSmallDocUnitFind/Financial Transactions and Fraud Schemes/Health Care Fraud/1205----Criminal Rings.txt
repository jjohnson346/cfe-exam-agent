Criminal Rings 
Individual criminals infiltrate mailrooms and are able to obtain copies of legitimate bills 
submitted to providers. They subsequently establish a mail drop point or rent an office and 
begin submitting false claims to insurance companies by creating fictitious tax identification 
numbers. Since the claimants are genuine, insurance companies will normally pay these bills.
