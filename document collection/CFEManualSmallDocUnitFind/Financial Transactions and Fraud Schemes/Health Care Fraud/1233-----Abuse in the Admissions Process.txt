Abuse in the Admissions Process 
Some psychiatric treatment facilities have developed programs for patients who exhibit 
symptoms of both psychiatric illness and substance abuse problems. Fraud occurs when a 
patient is admitted on the basis of a diagnosis that reflects the patient’s insurance coverage 
rather than the patient’s illness. Psychiatric hospitals have been accused of finding something 
wrong with patients when it is discovered that they have insurance coverage. Such patients 
may often be admitted without examination by a physician.
