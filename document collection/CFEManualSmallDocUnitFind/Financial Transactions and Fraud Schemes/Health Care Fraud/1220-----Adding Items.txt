Adding Items 
Extra charges are added onto hospital bills by assuming that hospitals used certain items, 
even though there was no evidence of the procedure or service. For instance, if the hospital 
had certain procedures for which they sometimes use a piece of x-ray equipment, the auditor 
reviewing the bill would always assume that the hospital had used the equipment, and they 
would put it on the bill.
