Investigation Tips 
To help determine whether a provider is an imposter: 
• Call the telephone number on the bill to determine if the provider exists; however, keep 
in mind that a fictitious provider may actually have rented a location and established a 
telephone number. 
• Contact the applicable licensing board or state to determine if the alleged provider was 
licensed to practice in the area at the time the service was allegedly provided. 
• Check the provider’s Social Security number or Tax Identification number (if listed on 
the bill) with the applicable licensing board. 
• Visit the provider’s physical address to determine if it is valid; if it is, speak to the 
superintendent to determine the tenant for that address. 
• Contact the Postal Inspector to verify what mail is being dropped at that address.
