“Running” and “Capping” Legislation 
Many states have enacted legislation to prevent attorneys from using runners or cappers to 
solicit business. Although state disciplinary rules generally prohibit this practice, very few 
attorneys have received any substantial sanctions. Some states, such as California, have taken 
the initiative to criminalize running and capping.  
 
Under a California law passed in July 1993, insurance companies now have the right to bring 
a lawsuit against any person who hires runners or cappers to procure clients or patients to 
obtain workers’ compensation benefits (Ins. Code 1971.7). This action need not be brought 
in the insurance company’s name. Instead, the insurance company can act on behalf of the 
“People of the State of California.”
