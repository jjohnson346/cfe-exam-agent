False Diagnoses 
When a provider knows that a service is not covered, he may use false diagnoses or 
procedure code manipulation to get a claim for the service paid. Examples of common 
services not covered are: 
• Annual physical examination. 
• School physicals. 
• Weight loss programs. 
• Stop smoking programs. 
• Investigational or experimental procedures. 
• Cosmetic surgery. 
 
In addition, physicians may justify the ordering of expensive x-rays or other diagnostic 
services by falsely purporting that a need exists to make such diagnostic inquiries. The 
services are rendered, but because is the claim for the services is based on false information 
and is used to deceive the insurance company, it is considered a false claim.
