2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1225 
For example, a medical bill can be altered by placing an additional number in front of the 
amount charged. The date of service can be altered so that it becomes a covered expense 
rather than one that was incurred prior to being eligible for coverage. The individual 
submitting a claim can change the name on the bill from a noncovered family member to 
one who is covered under the contract.
