Impostor Provider 
An impostor provider is a provider who does not exist but bills fraudulent claims. A variation 
on this scam involves assuming the identify of a deceased provider and practice—or putting 
together a group of licensed providers—and fraudulently billing under the group’s provider 
identification code.
