Provider Fraud 
Provider fraud is a fraud perpetrated by medical practitioners, medical suppliers, or medical 
facilities on patients or customers in order to increase their own income by illicit means. 
 
The potential for fraud involving providers has grown with the increased use of computer 
equipment in generating bills. Additionally, providers possess the knowledge of medical 
techniques, procedures, and terminology needed to avoid being questioned by claim-
 handling personnel. More insurance companies are contracting directly with providers for 
billing arrangements, leaving patients out of the loop. In addition, patients are usually 
reluctant to accuse physicians of wrongdoing because they rely on the provider’s continued 
services and because, when providers engage in fraudulent practices, they often forgive any 
out-of-pocket expenses the patient incurs.
