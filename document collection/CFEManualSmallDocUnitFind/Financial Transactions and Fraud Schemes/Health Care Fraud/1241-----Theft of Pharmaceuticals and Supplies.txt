Theft of Pharmaceuticals and Supplies 
Because of the ready market for selling pharmaceuticals and supplies, they have a propensity 
for being stolen. Narcotic drugs, although they are usually tightly controlled, still may be 
stolen and sold on the street. Supplies such as canes, sunglasses after cataract surgery, and 
admission kits are popular items for theft or employee abuse.
