Chiropractors 
Dishonest chiropractors may engage in fraud schemes, such as: 
• Billing for services never rendered or unnecessary services. 
• Billing for multiple family members. 
• Purchasing individual contracts for their patients. 
• Billing for physical therapy services when contract does not cover chiropractors. 
• Billing for excessive services. 
 
EXAMPLE 
While certain treatments by chiropractors are usually not covered by insurance, similar 
treatments by physicians may be covered. To correct this perceived inequity, some 
chiropractors have set up medical corporations and then hired medical doctors as employees. 
The chiropractor is CEO of the corporation and has total discretion of how the funds are 
disbursed. The net result of this set-up is that a medical doctor gives the stamp of approval 
to charges that might not otherwise be paid, and the chiropractor reaps the profits.
