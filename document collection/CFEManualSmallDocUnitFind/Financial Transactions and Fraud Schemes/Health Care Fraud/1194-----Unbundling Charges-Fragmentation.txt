Unbundling Charges/Fragmentation 
Simple unbundling occurs when a provider charges a comprehensive code as well as one or 
more component codes. For instance, in the examples illustrated below, the provider would 
be overpaid because the fee for the total procedure already includes the value of its 
component parts.
