Waiver of Deductibles and Co-payments 
Most insurance contracts require patients to pay a deductible and co-payment for services 
rendered. One of the reasons for having co-payments is to make insureds take an active part 
in the financial responsibility for their care. To attract patients, however, providers will 
forgive the patient’s out-of-pocket expense, but will make up for it in additional services that 
are billed to the insurance company.
