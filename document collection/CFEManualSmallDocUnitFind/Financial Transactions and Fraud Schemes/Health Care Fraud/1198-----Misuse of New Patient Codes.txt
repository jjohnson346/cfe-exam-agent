Misuse of New Patient Codes 
The CPT coding system includes special codes for new patient visits, which enable the 
physicians to be reimbursed for the additional work that new patient visits typically require. 
Consequently, physicians who want to pad their claims may bill for visits with established 
patients using new patient codes.
