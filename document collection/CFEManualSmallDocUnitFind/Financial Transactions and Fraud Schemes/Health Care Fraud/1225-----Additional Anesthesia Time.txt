Additional Anesthesia Time 
Another common scheme is the charging of additional hours of anesthesia. Patients should 
be billed from when they enter the surgery room to when they leave the surgery room. The 
revenue firm pads the bill by increasing the time billed to include time spent in a recovery 
room, or before the patient went into the operating room.
