MATERIAL MISCHARGES 
Material mischarges are usually limited to raw materials that can be used on many different 
contract products or diverted for personal use. Numerous cases have been discovered where 
the buyer-owned material, which was used on a similar contract (for example, commercial), 
shows up on the accounting records as being used in the manufacturing process for the 
subject contract (for example, government).
