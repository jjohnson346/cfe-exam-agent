Refining and Amending the Hypothesis 
In testing the hypothesis, the fraud examiner might find that all facts do not fit a particular 
scenario. If such is the case, the hypothesis should be revised and retested. (Obviously, if the 
known facts are tested with negative results, it could be that a fraud is not present, or it 
could indicate that the fraud cannot be proved.) In the Linda Reed Collins example, a 
discreet inquiry might determine that Collins did not have an excessive lifestyle but rather 
significant personal indebtedness. The fraud theory could then be appropriately revised. 
 
Following is a flow chart setting forth how the fraud examination process is used to resolve 
allegations.
