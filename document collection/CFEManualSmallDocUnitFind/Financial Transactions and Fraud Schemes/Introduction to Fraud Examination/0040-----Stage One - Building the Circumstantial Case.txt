Stage One: Building the Circumstantial Case 
As used here, circumstantial evidence  means all proof other than direct admission of  
wrongdoing by the subject or a co-conspirator. In a fraud case, it is the proof of the 
defendant’s representations, evidence of their falsity and intent. In a  corruption case, it is 
evidence of the standard behavior, the defendant’s breach, and the illegal payments. The 
circumstantial case also might include “similar act evidence” to show a common scheme or 
plan, lack of  mistake or accident, modus operandi, and most commonly, intent. 
  
Circumstantial evidence might be all that is available. It must be complete with no gaps, 
consistent (tending to prove a single point), and must exclude all explanations other than 
guilt. Collecting this type of evidence can be very difficult. Many complex cases lose 
direction during the circumstantial stage when the examiner becomes overwhelmed by the 
mass of accumulated detail and documents. To avoid getting bogged down, consider the 
following:
