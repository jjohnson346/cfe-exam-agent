Writing Reports 
Once evidence has been obtained and the appropriate witnesses have been interviewed, the 
fraud examiner is responsible for writing clear, accurate, and unbiased reports reflecting the 
fraud examination results. These reports ultimately might be used by management, attorneys, 
prosecutors, and others to determine the facts. The fraud examiner is a gatherer of 
evidence — not the ultimate judge thereof. Opinions in fraud examination matters are 
generally avoided.
