Simplify the Case 
If the case starts to sink under its own weight, the fraud examiner might look for a less 
demanding legal theory, break the case down into smaller components (e.g., prove one set of 
charges against one set of defendants before pursuing the other), or look for an informant or 
inside witness. The objective in every complex case is to break it down to its essentials and 
make it as simple and clear as possible.
