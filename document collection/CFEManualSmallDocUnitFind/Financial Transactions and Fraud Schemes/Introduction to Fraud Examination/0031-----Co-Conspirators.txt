Co-Conspirators 
If after examining documents, neutral third-party witnesses, and corroborative witnesses, it 
still appears that further work is warranted, the fraud examiner typically would interview 
co-conspirators to the alleged offense. In the case of Linda Reed Collins, if it were determined 
that a vendor was paying Collins kickbacks, that vendor typically would be interviewed prior 
to contacting Collins. People suspected of complicity generally are interviewed in the order 
of those thought to be least culpable to those thought to be most culpable. In criminal 
prosecutions, law enforcement officers and prosecutors can sometimes promise leniency to 
co-conspirators in return for their cooperation. These individuals are called “inside 
witnesses” and will be discussed in detail later. Such promises by private sector fraud 
examiners are not permitted, and might legally invalidate any admissions that are made.
