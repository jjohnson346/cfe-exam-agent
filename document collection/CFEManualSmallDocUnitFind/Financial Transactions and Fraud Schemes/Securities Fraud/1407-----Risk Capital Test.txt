Risk Capital Test  
As an alternative to the Howey Test many state and federal courts are using the so-called 
“Risk Capital Test.” This “test” allows the invest or to play a more active role if the funds he 
contributes are part of the “risk capital” of the business. A person entrusts money or other 
capital to another with the expectation of deriving a profit. The failure or success of the 
venture is dependent upon the managerial efforts of the other person. Several states have 
formally adopted this test, sometimes known as the Hawaii Market Test, as an alternative 
definition of investment contract. However, the Supreme Court has expressly declined to 
decide if this test should be used.
