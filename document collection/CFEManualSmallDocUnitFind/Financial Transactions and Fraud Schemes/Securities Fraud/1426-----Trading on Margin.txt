Trading on Margin 
Commodity futures are traded on margin. Only a small percentage, usually about 5 percent 
of the contract’s notional value, is required to establish a position (long or short) in a futures 
market (notional value is the contract size in units multiplied by the price per unit). Margins 
are set by the exchange for each commodity and are raised or lowered from time to time to 
reflect changing market volatility and notional contract values. Brokerage firms may require 
greater margin of their customers but may not require less than what the exchange has set. 
Each exchange will have a margin committee made up of exchange members and support 
personnel that monitors and evaluates the markets and makes margin changes  
as appropriate.  
 
There are two types of margin: initial margin, the amount of money per contract that must 
be present in the account when the position is initiated, and maintenance (variation) margin, 
the minimum amount of money per contract that must be maintained in the account while 
the position is open. For example, a December corn contract had a closing price of $2.84 
1/4 per bushel. The notional value of this contract is $14,212 (5,000 bushels x $2.84 1/4). 
The initial margin requirement set by the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) is $810 per 
contract, which is 5.69 percent of the notional contract value, while maintenance margin is

be liquidated without customer authorization in accounts that violate margin requirements.
