Unsuitable Recommendations 
Securities representatives are required to “know their customer.” They must take into 
account the financial profile and level of sophistication of the individual investor. Placing 
clients into unsuitable securities, for example recommending high-risk options to a senior 
citizen with limited assets, is prohibited.
