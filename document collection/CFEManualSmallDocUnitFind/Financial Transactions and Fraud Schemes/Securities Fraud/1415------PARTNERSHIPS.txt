PARTNERSHIPS 
Interests in limited partnerships are generally held to be securities because this type of 
structure conforms closely to Howey. General partnerships will not usually be held to be 
securities. This is normally because in a true general partnership the partners take an active 
role in the operation of the business. However, be warned that some promoters will try to 
disguise an investment contract as a general partnership. It is important to look beyond the 
surface wrapping and determine if the partners really take an active role in operating the 
entity. Some investment opportunities involving wireless cable and pay telephone leasing are 
good examples of this tactic.
