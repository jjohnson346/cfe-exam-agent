The Principle of Offset 
One of the features of commodity futures markets that make them so liquid and cost 
effective is the principle of offset. The obligation of the buyer (to accept future delivery) and 
the obligation of the seller (to make future delivery) is not with each other but with the 
central clearing function of the exchange (exchanges may have a separate clearing 
corporation or clearing may be a part of the exchange itself). Clearing matches futures 
transactions and becomes counterparty to both sides of the trade, eliminating counterparty 
credit risk by guarantying both sides of the transaction. As a result, traders can liquidate their 
positions (obligations) by merely executing an equal and opposite offsetting transaction 
(selling out a long position or buying back a short). Clearing also transfers funds between 
firms when futures trades are marked to market at the end of each day.
