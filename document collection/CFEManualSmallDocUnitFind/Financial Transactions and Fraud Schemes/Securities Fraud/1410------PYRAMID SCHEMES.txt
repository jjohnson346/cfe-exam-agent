PYRAMID SCHEMES 
These typically involve a scheme whereby fees or dues paid by a member to join an 
organization are to be paid to another member and there is a provision for increasing 
membership through a chain process of new members bringing in other new members. The 
members make money not by commission on the bona fide retail sale of a legitimate 
product, but by signing up new people. An organizational structure that, like the Ponzi 
scheme, relies on bringing in new people must eventually collapse. Although all pyramid 
schemes are fraudulent, and in many states specifically deemed illegal, not all pyramid 
schemes necessarily meet the Howey Test.
