Cash Flows from Operations 
The cash flows from operations section summarizes a company’s cash receipts and payments 
arising from its normal business operations. Cash inflows included in this category 
commonly consist of payments received from customers for sales, and cash outflows include 
payments to vendors for merchandise and operating expenses and to employees for wages.  
 
This category can also be summarized as those cash transactions that ultimately affect a 
company’s operating income; therefore, it is often considered the most important of the 
three categories of cash flows. If a company continually shows large profits per its income 
statement, but cannot generate positive cash flows from operations, then questionable 
accounting practices might be to blame. On the other hand, net income that is supported by 
positive and increasing net cash flows from operations is generally considered an indicator of 
a strong company. 
 
There are two methods of reporting cash flows from operations. In the above example, 
XYZ Company’s statement of cash flows is presented using the direct method. This method 
lists the sources of operating cash flows and the uses of operating cash flows, with the 
difference between them being the net cash flow from operating activities.  
 
In contrast, the indirect method  reconciles net income per the income statement with net cash 
flows from operating activities; that is, accrual-basis net income is adjusted for non-cash 
revenues and expenses to arrive at net cash flows from operations. Below is an example of 
XYZ Company’s cash flows from operations using the indirect method:

Note that the net cash flows from operating activities is the same amount - in this case, 
$1,000 — regardless of the method that is used.  The indirect method is usually easier to 
compute and provides a comparison of a company’s operating results under the accrual and 
cash methods of accounting. As a result, most companies choose to use the indirect method, 
but either method is acceptable.
