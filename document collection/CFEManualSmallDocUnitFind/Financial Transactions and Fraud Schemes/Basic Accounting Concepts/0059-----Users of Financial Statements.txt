Users of Financial Statements 
Financial statement fraud schemes are most often perpetrated by management against 
potential users of the statements. These users of financial statements include company 
ownership and management, lending organizations, investors, regulating bodies, vendors, 
and customers. The production of truthful financial statements plays an important role in 
the continued success of an organization. However, fraudulent statements can be used for a 
number of reasons. The most common use is to increase the apparent prosperity of an 
organization in the eyes of potential and current investors. (For more information, see the 
chapter on “Financial Statement Fraud.”)
