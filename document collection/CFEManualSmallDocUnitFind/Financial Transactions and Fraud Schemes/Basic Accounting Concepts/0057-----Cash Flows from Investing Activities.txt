Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
Cash inflows from investing activities usually arise from the sale of fixed assets (e.g., 
property and equipment), investments (e.g., the stocks and bonds of other companies), or 
intangible assets (e.g., patents and trademarks). Similarly, cash outflows from investing 
activities include any cash paid for the purchase of fixed assets, investments, or intangible 
assets.
