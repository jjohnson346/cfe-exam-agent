Whistleblower Programs 
As part of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, Congress amended section 7623 of 
the Internal Revenue Code to greatly enhance the IRS’s whistleblower program. Under this 
amendment, taxpayers have a statutory right to rewards of 15–30 percent of the collected 
proceeds (taxes, penalties, and interest) for information that leads directly to an 
administrative or judicial action by the Treasury Department. It also provides for up to 10 
percent of the collected proceeds for “less substantial” information. Congress also 
eliminated any cap on the potential amount of recovery by the informant. 
 
To manage this revised reward program, Congress established the IRS Whistleblower Office 
(WBO). This was done in response to complaints that the previous reward program had  
not been effectively managed.  
 
One important note before you pick up the phone to call the IRS: These 15–30 percent 
recoveries do not apply to smaller, individual cases. These larger percentage rewards do not 
apply to reports against individuals who make less than $200,000 and whose tax liability is 
less than $2 million. The rules do apply to all other individuals and entities.
