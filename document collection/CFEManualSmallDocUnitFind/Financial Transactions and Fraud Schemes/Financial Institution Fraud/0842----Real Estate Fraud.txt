Real Estate Fraud 
Generally defined, real estate fraud is any false representation, coupled with intent to 
deceive, made in connection with a real estate transaction. There are several real estate fraud 
schemes, including the real estate loan fraud schemes discussed previously. In addition, there 
has been a recent growth of mortgage fraud–related incidences due to the rise of subprime 
lending and the mortgage crisis. This section will further detail those real estate loan fraud

schemes and will examine several other real estate fraud schemes, including those stemming 
from subprime lending and the mortgage crisis. The schemes examined include:  
• Loan falsifications 
• Forged documents 
• Appraisal fraud 
• Straw buyers 
• Mortgage-backed security fraud 
• Equity skimming 
• Property flipping 
• Identity theft perpetrated in conjunction with a real estate transaction 
• Builder-bailout schemes 
• Seller assistance scams 
• Short-sale schemes 
• Chunking or shot gunning 
• Foreclosure rescue scams 
 
Most real estate transactions require more money than any single individual or entity can 
internally finance. Therefore, most of these transactions are financed to some extent. 
Because these transactions require borrowed money, experts are needed. These experts 
include appraisers, lenders, and auditors.
