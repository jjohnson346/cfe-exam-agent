Independent Review of Loans 
An independent review of loans provides a nonpartisan approach to all loan transactions. 
Either the internal or external auditors (or other consultants) can perform this independent 
review that allows for a “second opinion” on loan transactions. The reviews should be 
consistent and performed on a regular basis to help establish loan loss reserves. Typically, 
this loan review is established for loans for more than a certain dollar amount, such as 
$25,000 or $100,000.
