LETTER FORM REPORT 
The letter form report is used when a client is familiar with the area, and supporting data, 
therefore, is not necessary. The report consists of a brief description of the property, the 
type of value sought, the purpose served by the appraisal, the date of value, the value 
conclusion, and the signature of the appraiser. This form generally is not used by financial 
institutions for credit decisions.
