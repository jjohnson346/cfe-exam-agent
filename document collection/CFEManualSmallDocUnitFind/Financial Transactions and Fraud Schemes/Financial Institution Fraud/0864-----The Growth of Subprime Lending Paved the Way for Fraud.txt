The Growth of Subprime Lending Paved the Way for Fraud 
Subprime lending  refers to a variety of credit instruments lenders provide to people who do not 
qualify for the best market interest rate, usually due to weakened credit histories. There are 
many types of subprime mortgages, including: 
• Interest-only mortgages 
• Pick-a-payment loans 
• 2/28 adjustable-rate mortgage 
• Option-adjustable-rate mortgage 
 
Over the past decade, the subprime market grew dramatically, flourishing as the vehicle by 
which lenders funded loans to borrowers who would generally not qualify for traditional 
loans. According to industry newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance, Wall Street generated $1.8 
trillion in subprime loans from 2000 to 2007. In 2006, analysts estimated that 25 percent of 
all mortgages originated in the United States were subprime, and by 2007, 14 percent of all 
outstanding mortgage indebtedness in the United States was subprime in nature. By 2010, 
with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and 
the announcement of Wells Fargo to discontinue its subprime lending division, the 
percentage of subprime mortgages in the United States is expected to decline significantly. 
As Wells Fargo was the largest lender in the United States, it is possible that the percentage 
of subprime mortgages will fall to nearly 0. 
 
Corresponding with the growth of the subprime lending industry was a substantial increase 
in the number of mortgage fraud cases. The rise in fraudulent activity is the result of several 
factors, including the growth of automated loan processing and the growth of mortgage 
broker originated loans. These conditions, coupled with very lucrative possibilities, create an 
industry that that is very attractive to untrustworthy individuals or in other words, fraudsters.
