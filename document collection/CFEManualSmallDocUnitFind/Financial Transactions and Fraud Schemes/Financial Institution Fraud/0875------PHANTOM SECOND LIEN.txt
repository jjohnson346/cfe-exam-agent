PHANTOM SECOND LIEN 
In a variation of the phantom sale scheme, a person assumes a homeowner’s identity and 
takes out an additional loan or a second mortgage in the homeowner’s name. If there is not 
enough equity in the home to warrant a second loan, an inflated appraisal is obtained. This 
scheme involves a high level of collusion between a loan officer, an appraiser, and a  
title agent. 
 
Some red flags to help identify identity theft arising during the mortgage lending process 
include:  
• A change of address notice is filed immediately. 
• The appraised value is inflated. 
• There is no prior lien payoff reflected on the HUD-1 settlement statement.

• Documents are forged or there are discrepancies between the borrower’s document 
signatures.  
• The recorded owner lives abroad or is deceased. 
• Mail or e-mail sent to the borrower is returned as undeliverable even though  
transactions continue.
