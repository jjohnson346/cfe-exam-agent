Financial Institution Fraud

Mortgage Pulling 
For the purpose of disguising loans exceeding a bank’s legal limits, loans are made to a 
partnership’s members who by prearrangement then invest in a single risky venture in a total 
amount exceeding the lending limit. In reality, the single borrower is the partnership, and the 
collateral is the partnership’s property. Mort gage-pulling might involve fraudulent loan 
applications and payoffs to the individual partners for participating.
