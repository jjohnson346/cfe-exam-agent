Forged Documents 
Since W-2 forms, bank statements, title commitments, leases, tax returns, and similar 
documents other than the loan application are used to verify income and asset information, 
such documents are routinely falsified, altered, or forged to perpetuate mortgage fraud 
schemes. In 2009, forged documents were the most reported mortgage fraud scheme 
according to FinCEN.
