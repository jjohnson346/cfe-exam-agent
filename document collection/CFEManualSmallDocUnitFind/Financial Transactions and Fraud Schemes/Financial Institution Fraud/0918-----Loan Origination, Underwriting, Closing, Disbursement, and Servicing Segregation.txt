Financial Institution Fraud


:


Loan Origination, Underwriting, Closing, Disbursement, and Servicing Segregation 
By separating all of the functions relating to loans, a lending institution reduces the 
opportunity for an individual (insider) to perpetrate loan fraud. Additionally, the segregation 
provides for at least one, if not several, levels of independent review to reduce its external 
loan fraud exposure.
