Money Transfer (Wire) Fraud Schemes 1  
Wire transfers of funds are nothing new—they began in the 1940s. However, with today’s 
growing emphasis on a cashless society, the number of wire transfers increases each year. 
 
Typically, fraudsters who commit this type of crime are knowledgeable about wire transfer 
activity, have at least one contact within the target company, and are aggressive in carrying 
out the theft.
