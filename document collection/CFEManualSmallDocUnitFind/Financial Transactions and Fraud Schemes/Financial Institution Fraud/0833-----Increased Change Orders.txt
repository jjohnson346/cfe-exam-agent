Increased Change Orders 
An increase in the number of change orders or amounts on change orders might be an 
indication that construction changes have taken place that would alter the originally planned 
project to such an extent as to render the underwriting inappropriate. Change orders can 
have the same impact on a project as altering the original documents. As with anything that 
is contracted for on a bid basis, change orders could also be an indication of collusive 
bidding. Change orders might be an indication that the original project was not feasible and 
short cuts are shoring up other problem areas. Change orders should be approved by the 
architect and engineer on the project in addition to the lender’s inspector.
