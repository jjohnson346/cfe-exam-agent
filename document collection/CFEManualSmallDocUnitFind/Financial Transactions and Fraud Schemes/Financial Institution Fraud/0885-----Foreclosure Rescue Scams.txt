Foreclosure Rescue Scams 
Unfortunately, as more homeowners struggle with potential foreclosure, more will fall prey 
to foreclosure rescue scams. There are some legitimate foreclosure assistance programs in 
which the homeowner is offered short-term financing that pays off the delinquent debt. This 
allows homeowners to stay in their homes as tenants until they can repair their credit and 
obtain long-term financing. However, there are also many fraudulent programs. 
 
Foreclosure rescue scams come in two primary variations: phantom-help scams and bailout, 
or rescue, scams.
