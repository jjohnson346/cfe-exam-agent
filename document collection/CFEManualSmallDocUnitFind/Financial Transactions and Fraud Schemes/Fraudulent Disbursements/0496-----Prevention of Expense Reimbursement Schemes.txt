Prevention of Expense Reimbursement Schemes 
Detailed Expense Reports: Submission and Review 
Detailed expense reports should require the following information: 
• Receipts or other support documentation 
• Explanation of the expense including specific business purpose 
• Time period expense occurred  
• Place of expenditure  
• Amount   
 
It is not enough to have the detailed reports submitted if they are not reviewed. A policy 
requiring the periodic review of expense reports, coupled with examining the appropriate 
detail, will help deter employees from submitting personal expenses for reimbursement.
