PHOTOCOPIED FORGERIES 
To guarantee an accurate forgery, some employees make photocopies of legitimate 
signatures. The signature of an authorized signer is copied from some document (such as a 
business letter) onto a transparency, then the transparency is laid over a blank check so that 
the signature copies onto the maker line of the check. The result is a check with a perfect 
signature of an authorized maker.
