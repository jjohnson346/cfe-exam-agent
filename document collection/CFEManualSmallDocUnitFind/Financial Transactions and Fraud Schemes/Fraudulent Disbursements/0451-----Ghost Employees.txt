Ghost Employees 
The term ghost employee  refers to someone on the payroll who does not actually work for the 
victim company. Through the falsification of personnel or payroll records a fraudster causes 
paychecks to be generated to a ghost. The fraudster or an accomplice then converts these 
paychecks. (See “Ghost Employees” flowchart.) The ghost employee may be a fictitious 
person or a real individual who simply does not work for the victim employer. When the 
ghost is a real person, it is often a friend or relative of the perpetrator.  
 
In order for a ghost employee scheme to work, four things must happen: (1) the ghost must 
be added to the payroll, (2) timekeeping and wage rate information must be collected, (3) a 
paycheck must be issued to the ghost, and (4) the check must be delivered to the perpetrator 
or an accomplice.
