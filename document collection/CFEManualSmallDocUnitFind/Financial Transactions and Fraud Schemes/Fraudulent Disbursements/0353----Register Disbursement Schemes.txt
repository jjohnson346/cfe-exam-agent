Register Disbursement Schemes 
Fraudulent disbursements at the cash register are different from the other schemes that 
often take place at the register, such as skimming and cash larceny. When cash is stolen as 
part of a register disbursement scheme, the removal of the cash is recorded on the register 
tape. A false transaction is entered so it appears that the disbursement of money was 
legitimate.  
 
There are two basic register disbursements schemes: false refunds and false voids. While the 
schemes are largely similar, there are a few differences between the two that merit discussing 
them separately.
