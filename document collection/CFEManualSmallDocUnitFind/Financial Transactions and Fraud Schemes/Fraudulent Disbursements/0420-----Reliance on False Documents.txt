Reliance on False Documents  
When an employee does not have approval authority for purchases and does not have the 
benefit of a rubber stamp supervisor, he must run his vouchers through the normal accounts 
payable process. The success of this kind of scheme will depend on the apparent authenticity 
of the false voucher he creates. If the perpetrator can generate purchase orders and receiving 
reports that corroborate the information on the fraudulent invoice from his shell company, 
he can fool accounts payable into issuing a check.
