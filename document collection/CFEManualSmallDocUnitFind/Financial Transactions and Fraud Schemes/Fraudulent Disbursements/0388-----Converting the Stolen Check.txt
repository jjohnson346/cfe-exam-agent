Converting the Stolen Check 
Once a check has been intercepted, the perpetrator can cash it by forging the payee’s 
signature, hence the term forged endorsement scheme. Depending on where he tries to cash the 
check, the perpetrator may or may not need fake identification at this stage. If a perpetrator 
is required to produce identification in order to cash his stolen check, and if he does not 
have a fake ID in the payee’s name, he may use a dual endorsement to cash or deposit the 
check. In other words, the perpetrator forges the payee’s signature as though the payee had 
transferred the check to him, then the perpetrator endorses the check in his own name and 
converts it. When the bank statement is reconciled, dual endorsements on checks should 
always raise suspicions, particularly when the second signer is an employee of the company.
