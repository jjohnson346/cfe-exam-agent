Altered Payee Schemes 
The second type of intercepted check scheme is the altered payee scheme. This is a form of 
check tampering in which an employee intercepts a company check intended for a third 
party and alters the payee designation so that the check can be converted by the employee or 
an accomplice. (See “Altered Payee Schemes” flowchart.) The employee inserts his own 
name, the name of an accomplice, or the name of a fictitious entity on the payee line of the 
check. The alteration essentially makes the check payable to the employee (or an 
accomplice), so there is no need to forge an endorsement and no need to obtain false 
identification.
