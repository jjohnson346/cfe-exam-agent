Multiple Reimbursements 
The least common of the expense reimbursement schemes involves multiple 
reimbursements. This type of fraud involves the submission of a single expense more than 
one time. The most frequent example of a multiple reimbursement scheme is the submission 
of several types of support for the same expense.

EXAMPLE 
An employee would use, for example, an airline ticket stub  and a travel agency invoice on 
separate expense reports so that he could be reimbursed twice for the cost of a single flight. 
The fraudster would have his division president authorize one report and have the vice 
president approve the other so that neither would see both reports. Additionally, the 
perpetrator allowed a time lag of about a month between the filing of the two reports so that 
the duplication would be less noticeable. 
 
In cases where a company does not require original documents as support, some employees 
even use several copies of the same support document to generate multiple reimbursements. 
Rather than file two expense reports, employees may also charge an item to the company 
credit card, save the receipt, and attach it to an expense report as if they paid for the item 
themselves. The victim organization therefore ends up paying twice for the same expense.
