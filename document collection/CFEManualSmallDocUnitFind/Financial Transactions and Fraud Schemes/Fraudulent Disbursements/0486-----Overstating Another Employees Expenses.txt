Overstating Another Employee’s Expenses 
Overstated expense reimbursement schemes are not only committed by the person who 
actually incurs the expense. Sometimes, they may be committed by a coworker who handles 
or processes expense reports.  
 
EXAMPLE 
A petty cashier whited out other employees’ requests for travel advances and inserted larger 
amounts. The cashier then passed on the legitimate travel advances and pocketed the excess.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.577 
This kind of scheme is most likely to occur in a system where expenses are reimbursed in 
currency rather than by a check, since the perpetrator would be unable to extract his “cut” 
from a single check made out to another employee.
