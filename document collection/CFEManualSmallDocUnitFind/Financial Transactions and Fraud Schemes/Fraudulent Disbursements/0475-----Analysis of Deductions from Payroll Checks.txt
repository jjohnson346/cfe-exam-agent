Analysis of Deductions from Payroll Checks 
An analysis of the payroll withholdings may reveal either ghost employees or trust account 
abuses. Ghost employees will often have no withholding taxes, insurance, or other normal 
deductions. Therefore, a listing of any employee without these items may reveal a ghost 
employee. 
 
An analysis of withholding-tax deposits may reveal that trust account taxes have been 
“borrowed,” even for a short period, before the taxes are deposited. Comparing the 
disbursement date with the deposit date should reveal if the trust account taxes have been 
borrowed. Additionally, any delinquent payroll tax notices from the taxing authorities should 
serve as a red flag to potential trust account tax “borrowings.”
