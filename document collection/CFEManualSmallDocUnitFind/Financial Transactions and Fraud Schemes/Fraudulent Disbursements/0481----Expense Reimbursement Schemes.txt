Expense Reimbursement Schemes 
Employees can manipulate an organization’s expense reimbursement procedures to generate 
fraudulent disbursements. Expense reimbursements are usually paid by the company in the 
following manner. An employee submits a report detailing an expense incurred for a 
business purpose, such as a business lunch with a client, airfare, hotel bills associated with 
business travel, and so forth. In preparing an expense report, an employee is usually required 
to explain the business purpose for the expense, as well as the time, date, and location in 
which it was incurred. Support documentation for the expense, typically a receipt, should be 
attached to the report. In some cases canceled checks written by the employee or copies of a 
personal credit card statement showing the expense are allowed in lieu of receipts. The 
report must usually be authorized by a supervisor in order for the expense to be reimbursed. 
The four most common types of expense reimbursement schemes are mischaracterized 
expenses, overstated expenses, fictitious expenses, and multiple reimbursements.
