“Rubber Stamp” Supervisors  
If an employee cannot authorize payments himself, the next best thing is if the person who 
has that authority is inattentive or overly trusting. “Rubber stamp” supervisors like this are 
destined to be targeted by unethical employees. In some cases, supervisors are attentive to 
the purchase orders they are asked to authorize, but they lack the technical knowledge to 
spot fraud as it is happening. For instance, a manager or administrator might not completely 
understand the costs associated with upgrading computer software to modernize a work 
area. This manager will have to rely on his subordinates who have the necessary technical 
expertise to determine that costs are being kept in line. The subordinates may be able to take 
advantage of this situation to cause the company to overpay for the equipment required to 
upgrade the system.
