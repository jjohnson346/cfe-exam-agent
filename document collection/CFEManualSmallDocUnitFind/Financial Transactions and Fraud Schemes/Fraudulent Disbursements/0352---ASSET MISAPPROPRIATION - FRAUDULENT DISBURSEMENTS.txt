ASSET MISAPPROPRIATION: FRAUDULENT DISBURSEMENTS 
 
In fraudulent disbursement schemes, an employee makes a distribution of company funds 
for a dishonest purpose. Examples of fraudulent disbursements include forging company 
checks, the submission of false invoices, doctoring timecards, and so forth. On their face, 
the fraudulent disbursements do not appear any different from valid disbursements of cash. 
For instance, when an employee runs a bogus invoice through the accounts payable system, 
the victim organization cuts a check for the bad invoice right along with all the legitimate 
payments it makes. The perpetrator has taken money from his employer in such a way that it 
appears to be a normal disbursement of cash. Someone might notice the fraud based on the 
amount, recipient, or destination of the payment, but the method of payment is legitimate.
