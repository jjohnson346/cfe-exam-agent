EMPLOYEES WITH ACCESS TO COMPANY CHECKS 
One cannot forge a company check unless one first possesses a company check. Most 
forgery schemes are committed by accounts payable clerks, office managers, bookkeepers, or 
other employees whose duties typically include the preparation of company checks. These 
are people who have access to the company checkbook on a regular basis and are therefore 
in the best position to steal blank checks.
