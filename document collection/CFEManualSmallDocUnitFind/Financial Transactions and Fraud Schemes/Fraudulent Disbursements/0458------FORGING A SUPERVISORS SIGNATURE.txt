FORGING A SUPERVISOR’S SIGNATURE  
When using this method, an employee typically withholds his timecard from those being sent 
to the supervisor for approval, forges the supervisor’s signature or initials, then adds the 
timecard to the stack of authorized cards, which are sent to the payroll department. The 
fraudulent timecard arrives at the payroll department with what appears to be a supervisor’s 
approval and a paycheck is subsequently issued.
