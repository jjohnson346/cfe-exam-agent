Overtime Authorization 
Requiring employees to have overtime authorized by a supervisor, having the supervisor be 
responsible for the timecards, and having the supervisor refer the timecards directly to 
payroll will aid in reducing overtime abuses. In addition, the payroll department should scan 
the time reports and question obvious abuses such as only one employee working overtime 
in a department or excessive overtime on a timecard. By examining the source 
documentation, one may detect unauthorized overtime and falsified hours abuses.
