Review and Analysis of Expense Accounts 
Generally, expense account review uses one of two methods: historical comparisons or 
comparisons with budgeted amounts. A historical comparison compares the balance 
expended this period in relation to the balance spent in prior, similar periods. When 
performing this review, consider changes to the marketing, servicing, or other company 
operations. 
 
Budgets are estimates of the money and/or time necessary to complete the task. They are 
based on past experience with consideration for current and future business conditions. 
Therefore, when comparing actual and budgeted expenses, determining inordinate expenses 
or inaccurate budget estimates is important.
