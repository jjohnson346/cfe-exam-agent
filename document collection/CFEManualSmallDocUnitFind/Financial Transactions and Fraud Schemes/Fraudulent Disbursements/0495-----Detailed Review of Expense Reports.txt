with the travel and entertainment policies of the company. Additionally, the following two 
steps may help to detect and deter employee expense abuses: 
• Require employees to submit their expense reports for a detailed review before payment

reviewed, he will be less likely to include fraudulent expenses on the report.  
• Periodically audit travel and entertainment accounts. This is particularly effective shortly 
before employee performance reviews.
