Forging the Signature 
After the employee has obtained and prepared a blank check, he must forge an authorized 
signature in order to convert the check. The most obvious method, and the one that comes 
to mind when one thinks of the word “forgery,” is to simply take pen in hand and sign the 
name of an authorized maker.
