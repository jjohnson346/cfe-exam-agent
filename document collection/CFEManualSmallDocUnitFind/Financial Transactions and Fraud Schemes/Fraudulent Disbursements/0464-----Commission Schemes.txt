Commission Schemes 
Commission is a form of compensation calculated as a percentage of the amount of 
transactions a salesperson or other employee generates. It is a unique form of compensation 
that is not based on hours worked or a set yearly salary, but rather on an employee’s revenue 
output. A commissioned employee’s wages are based on two factors, the amount of sales he 
generates and the percentage of those sales he is paid. In other words, there are two ways an 
employee on commission can fraudulently increase his pay: (1) falsify the amount of sales 
made, or (2) increase his rate of commission. (See “Commission Schemes” flowchart.)
