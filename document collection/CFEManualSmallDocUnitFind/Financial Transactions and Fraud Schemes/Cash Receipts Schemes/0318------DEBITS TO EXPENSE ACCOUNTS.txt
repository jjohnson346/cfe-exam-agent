DEBITS TO EXPENSE ACCOUNTS 
An employee might conceal the skimming of funds by making unsupported entries in the 
victim company’s books. If a payment is made on a receivable, for instance, the proper entry 
is a debit to cash and a credit to the receivable. Instead of debiting cash, the employee might 
choose to debit an expense account. This transaction still keeps the company’s books in 
balance, but the incoming cash is never recorded. In addition, the customer’s receivable 
account is credited, so it will not become delinquent.
