Inventory Padding 
A problem for fraudsters in some skimming schemes is the victim organization’s inventory. 
Off-book sales of goods will always leave an in ventory shortage and a corresponding rise in 
the cost of goods sold.  
 
When a sale of goods is made, the physical inventory is reduced by the amount of 
merchandise sold. For instance, when a retailer sells a pair of shoes there is one less pair of 
shoes in the stock room If this sale is not recorded, however, the shoes are not removed 
from the perpetual inventory records. Thus, there is one less pair of shoes on hand than in 
the perpetual inventory. A reduction in the physical inventory without a corresponding 
reduction in the perpetual inventory is known as “shrinkage.”  
 
When an employee skims sales of services there is no shrinkage (because there is no 
inventory for services), but when sales of goods are skimmed, shrinkage always occurs. Some 
amounts of shrinkage are expected due to customer theft, faulty products, and spoilage, but 
high levels of shrinkage serve as a warning that a company could be a victim of occupational

fraud. The general methods used to conceal inventory shrinkage are discussed in detail in the 
Inventory and Other Assets section.
