Receipt or Sales Level Detection 
Key analytical procedures, such as vertical and horizontal analysis of sales accounts, can be 
used for skimming detection on a grand scale. These procedures analyze changes in the 
accounts and can possibly point to skimming problems including understated sales.  
Ratio analysis can also provide keys to the detection of skimming schemes. These 
procedures are discussed in detail in the Fraudulent Financial Statement section.  
 
Detailed inventory control procedures can also be utilized to detect inventory shrinkage due 
to unrecorded sales. Inventory detection methods include statistical sampling, trend analysis, 
reviews of receiving reports and inventory records, verification of material requisition and 
shipping documentation, as well as actual physical inventory counts. These procedures are 
reviewed in the section on Inventory and Other Assets.
