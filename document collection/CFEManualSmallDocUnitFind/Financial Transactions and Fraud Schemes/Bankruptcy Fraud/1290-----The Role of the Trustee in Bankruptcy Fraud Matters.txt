The Role of the Trustee in Bankruptcy Fraud Matters 
The trustee in bankruptcy matters is often confronted with allegations of fraud and 
misconduct on the part of the debtor and its principals. In Chapter 11 cases, it is often the 
primary reason the court appointed a trustee. Creditors, representatives of the creditors’ 
committee, or private investigators might be interacting with a bankruptcy trustee. For this 
reason, it is important to know how the trustee operates, what the role of the trustee is, and 
how to make the most of the opportunity to work with the trustee. The trustee’s authority to 
investigate fraud is found in the Bankruptcy Code. The following is a brief outline of the 
Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 trustee’s authority to investigate fraud.
