Examiners 
An examiner is normally appointed in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding to investigate 
certain allegations of fraud and misconduct on the part of the debtor (or principals of the 
debtor). In a typical motion for the appointment of a trustee or examiner, allegations of 
fraud or misconduct are raised by creditors, the Office of the UST, or other interested 
parties. A bankruptcy judge hears evidence submitted by all parties (creditors et al.), as well 
as the debtor’s response to the allegations. After hearing the evidence, the judge has the 
option either to appoint a trustee or an examiner, or leave the debtor in possession of the 
business. If an examiner is appointed, the sole responsibility is to “investigate and report” 
the results of the investigation to the court and other parties in interest as quickly as possible. 
Examiners have the power to subpoena records and depose witnesses. They do not have the 
power to run businesses, make business decisions, or propose plans of reorganizations

(generally speaking). Courts might expand the examiner’s powers to perform certain duties 
of trustees or debtors-in-possession.
