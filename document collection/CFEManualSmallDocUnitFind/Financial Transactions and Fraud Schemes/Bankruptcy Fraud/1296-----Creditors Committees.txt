Creditors’ Committees  
After filing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, the UST normally appoints a committee of 
creditors holding unsecured claims. This committee is referred to as a creditors’ committee. 
Title 11, U.S.C., section 1102 provides guidance in the formation of creditors’ committees. 
 
Title 11, U.S.C., section 1103 details the powers of creditors’ committees. They can employ 
attorneys, accountants, or other agents to assist them in the performance of their duties 
under the code. In carrying out their duties, creditors’ committees are authorized to consult 
with the trustee or debtor-in-possession concerning the administration of the case; to 
investigate the acts, conduct, assets, liabilities, and financial condition of the debtor and the 
operation of the debtor’s business; to participate in the formation of a plan of 
reorganization; to request the appointment of a trustee or examiner; and to perform such 
other services as are in the interest of those represented.
