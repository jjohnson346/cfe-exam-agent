Paragraph 3 — False Declarations 
 
A person who knowingly and fraudulently makes a false declaration, certificate, verification or 
statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of Title 28, in or in relation 
to any case under Title 11.  
 
Written documents filed with the court under penalty of perjury consist of the debtor’s 
petition, schedules and statements of financial affairs, interim statements and operating 
reports, as well as declarations filed with the court. Declarations are made in petitions, 
schedules and in other court filings (motions). This section gives the same weight to 
unsworn declarations as to those sworn under penalty of perjury.
