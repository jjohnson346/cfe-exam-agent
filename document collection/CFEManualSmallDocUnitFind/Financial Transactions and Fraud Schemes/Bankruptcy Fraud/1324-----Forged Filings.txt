Forged Filings 
Bankruptcy petitions are sometimes filed in another (uninvolved) person’s name, usually as 
part of a larger scheme using an assumed identity. It can take years to correct the credit 
records of the person whose identity has been stolen. Sometimes the debtor’s name is 
obtained from obituary notices.
