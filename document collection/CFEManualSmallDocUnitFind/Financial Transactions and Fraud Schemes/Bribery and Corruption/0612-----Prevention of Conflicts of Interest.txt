Prevention of Conflicts of Interest 
Organizations should establish policies clearly de fining what constitutes a conflict of interest, 
and prohibiting any such entanglements by officers, directors, employees, or other agents of 
the organization. A policy requiring employees to complete an annual disclosure statement is 
an excellent proactive approach to dealing with potential conflicts. Comparing the disclosed 
names and addresses with vendor and customer lists may reveal real conflicts of interest or 
the appearance of such. Furthermore, these statements will reinforce in employees the idea 
that engaging in conflicts of interests is unacceptable and will result in severe consequences.
