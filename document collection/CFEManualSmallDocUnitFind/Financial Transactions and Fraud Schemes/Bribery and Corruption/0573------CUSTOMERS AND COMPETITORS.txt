CUSTOMERS AND COMPETITORS 
In a kickback case, the “customer” (agency) is the employer of the person taking payoffs, 
and is also the victim of the crime. Customers and competitors can provide valuable 
information about the payer’s business operation, particularly concerning the payer’s regular 
bank account, which can be identified through canceled checks. The customer might also 
have invoices and shipping documents that might lead to off-book funds.
