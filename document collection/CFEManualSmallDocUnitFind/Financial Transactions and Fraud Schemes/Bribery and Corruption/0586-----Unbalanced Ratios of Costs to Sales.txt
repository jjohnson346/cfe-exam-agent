Unbalanced Ratios of Costs to Sales 
The cost of producing and selling a particular item usually bears some fixed relationship to 
the revenue it generates. A significant imbalance in such a ratio, such as in a situation where 
twice the supplies are ordered than are needed to produce the reported sales (and the extra is 
not located in inventory), indicates possible unrecorded transactions. This technique is used 
to identify unreported sales by bars and restaurants.
