Turnaround Sales  
A special kind of purchasing scheme sometimes used by fraudsters is called the turnaround 
sale or the flip. In this type of scheme an employee knows his employer is seeking to purchase 
a certain asset and takes advantage of the situation by purchasing the asset himself (usually in 
the name of an accomplice or shell company). The fraudster then turns around and resells 
the item to his employer at an inflated price.  
 
EXAMPLE 
A chief executive officer, conspiring with a former employee, sold an office building to the 
CEO’s company. What made the transaction suspicious was that the building had been 
purchased by the former employee on the same day that it was resold to the victim company, 
and for $1.2 million less than the price charged to the CEO’s company.
