BID POOLING 
Bid pooling is a process by which several bidders conspire to split contracts up and ensure 
that each gets a certain amount of work. Instead of submitting confidential bids, the vendors 
discuss what their bids will be so they can guarantee that each vendor will win a share of the 
purchasing company’s business. For example, if vendors A, B, and C are up for three 
separate jobs, they may agree that A’s bid will be the lowest on the first contract, B’s bid will 
be the lowest on the second contract, and C’s bid will be the lowest on the third contract. 
None of the vendors gets all three jobs, but on the other hand, they are all guaranteed to get 
at least one. Furthermore, since they plan their bids ahead of time, the vendors can conspire 
to raise their prices. Thus the purchasing company suffers as a result of the scheme.
