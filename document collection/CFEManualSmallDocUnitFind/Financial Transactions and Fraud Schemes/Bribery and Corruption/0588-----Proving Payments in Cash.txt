Proving Payments in Cash  
The following techniques can be used to prove cash payments circumstantially, or to 
corroborate testimony of such payments by an inside witness: 
• Match evidence of cash withdrawals or disb ursements by the payer with corresponding 
deposits, expenditures, or visits to a safe deposit box by the recipient. 
• Look for the purchase of cashier’s checks, trav eler’s checks, or wire transfers payable to 
the recipient at, or shortly after, cash withdrawals or disbursements. Also look for a 
correlation between cash-generating transactions and money wires or courier services, 
which are sometimes used to send cash. 
• If the scheme is ongoing, consider the use of visual or electronic surveillance (if you’re a 
member of law enforcement), or try to introduce an undercover agent or implement a 
sting operation. 
• Unexplained or unusual cash disbursements or withdrawals, particularly from a business 
that does not normally deal in cash, might itself indicate illicit transactions, or 
corroborate such testimony. To be effective, the examiner must identify and rebut all 
legitimate explanations, which usually requires interviewing the payer. 
• Focus the investigation on the suspected recipient, as discussed below.
