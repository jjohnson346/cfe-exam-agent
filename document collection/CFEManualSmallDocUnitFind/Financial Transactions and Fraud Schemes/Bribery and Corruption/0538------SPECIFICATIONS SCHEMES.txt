SPECIFICATIONS SCHEMES 
The other type of presolicitation fraud is a specifications scheme. The specifications of a 
contract are a list of the elements, materials, dimensions, and other relevant requirements for 
completion of the project. Specifications are prepared to assist vendors in the bidding 
process, telling them what they are required to do and providing a firm basis for making and 
accepting bids.

One corruption scheme that occurs in this process is the fraudulent tailoring of 
specifications to a particular vendor. In these cases, the vendor pays off an employee of the 
buyer who is involved in preparing specifications for the contract. In return, the employee 
tailors the specifications to accommodate that vendor’s capabilities so that the contractor is 
effectively assured of winning the contract.  
 
The methods used to restrict competition in the bidding process may include the use of 
“prequalification” procedures that are known to eliminate certain competitors. For instance, 
the bid may require potential contractors to have a certain percentage of female or minority 
ownership. There is nothing illegal with such a requirement, but if it is placed in the 
specifications as a result of a bribe rather than as the result of other factors, then the 
employee has sold his influence to benefit a dishonest vendor, a clear case of corruption.  
 
Some employees distort the requirements of contracts by claiming the specifications called 
for a sole-source provider or noncompetitive procurement. This causes competitive bidding 
to be disregarded and the contract to be awarded to a particular supplier. The supplier 
typically charges a much higher price than the company could have obtained through 
bidding. Sole-source or noncompetitive procurement justifications may also be used to 
eliminate competition and steer contracts to a particular vendor.  
 
EXAMPLE  
A requisitioner distorted the requirements of a contract up for bid, claiming the 
specifications called for a sole-source provider. Based on the requisitioner’s information, 
competitive bidding was disregarded and the cont ract was awarded to a particular supplier. 
A review of other bids received at a later date showed that certain materials were available 
for up to $70,000 less than what the company paid in the sole-source arrangement. The 
employee had helped divert the job to the contractor in return for a promise of future 
employment. 
 
Another form of specifications fraud is bid splitting. Entities are often required to solicit 
bids on projects over a certain dollar amount. In order to avoid this requirement, employees 
might break a large project up into several small projects that fall below the mandatory 
bidding level. Once the contract is split, the employee can award some or all of the 
component parts to a contractor with whom he is conspiring.

A less egregious but nevertheless unfair form of bid-rigging occurs when a vendor pays an 
employee of the buyer for the right to see the specifications earlier than his competitors. The 
employee does not alter the specifications to suit the vendor, but instead simply gives him a 
head start on planning his bid and preparing for the job.
