Other Schemes  
In other cases, the perpetrator might not write off the scheme, but simply delay billing. This 
is sometimes done as a “favor” to a friendly client and is not an outright avoidance of the bill 
but rather a dilatory tactic. The victim organization eventually gets paid, but loses time value 
on the payment, which arrives later than it should.
