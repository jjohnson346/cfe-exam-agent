ACCOUNTING BOOKS AND RECORDS 
Examine the cash disbursement journals and ledgers. The most important of the above 
information (and often the only information needed) is the bank account information. Begin 
by examining the checks, check register, and/or the cash disbursement journal and paying 
particular attention to the following: 
• Payables and expenses charged to the account (cust omer) on which the illicit payments were made — If 
the examiner suspects that kickbacks were paid on sales to the ABC Corporation, for 
example, look at the payables and expenses charged to that account/customer. 
• Payments for services — Check payments for services such as sales commissions or 
consulting fees, which do not require the delivery of goods and need relatively little 
documentation to obtain payment. 
• Anomalous charges — For the business, an example of anomalous payments can be those 
for design fees paid by a company that is engaged in business that normally would not 
require such services.  
• The endorsement on the check — This might be by signature, or more commonly, by a stamp 
in the name of the business payee. Note the identity of the endorser. (Some corrupt 
Bribery and Corruption  Financial Transactions   
1.724                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
recipients have been known to endorse such checks in their own name.) 
• The location where the check was negotiated —If not obvious from the endorsement, identify 
the bank where the deposit was made by checking the depository bank’s stamp on the 
back of the check. The geographical location of the depository bank is an important lead 
that can connect the check to the suspected recipient. Determining the depository bank’s 
identity is critical to obtaining the recipient’s bank account information. 
• Checks with a second endorsement — A typical indication of a phony payable check is one paid 
to, and endorsed by, a business, which is then endorsed by an individual, thereby 
permitting it to be cashed or deposited in a personal account. In similar fashion, a check 
payable to a third party can be signed over to the issuer of the check. 
• Cashed (not deposited) checks payable to a business — Generally, a “For Deposit Only” stamp 
appears on the back of deposited checks, although this is not always the case. Most 
banks have a code stamp that indicates whether the check was cashed or not. These 
codes vary, and can be obtained from the bank where the check was negotiated. 
• Checks that fall into an unexplained pattern — An example of a suspicious payable scheme is 
one where checks are drawn once a month in an amount equal to some percentage of 
the sales against which they are charged, and are not otherwise explained. Such a pattern 
might indicate a kickback scheme. If an examination of the checks themselves does not 
yield any clear leads, compare the various records of payment with the backup 
documentation. Note particularly the following circumstances: 
• The absence of documentation — The absence of documentation to support a particular 
payment can include: 
? No invoice appearing in the files for a payment to a supplier or contractor. 
? No receipt to indicate that materials paid for were delivered. 
? No consultant’s work product to substantiate consulting fees paid. 
• Discrepancies — Discrepancies between payment information and backup documentation 
can include: 
? A check payable to a supplier in an amount different than his invoice. 
? A check payable to a person or entity different than that identified on the invoice. 
• Anomalies in support documents — Anomalies in the backup documentation can include 
invoices from several suppliers in different names that: 
? Have the same business address. 
? Are signed by the same person. 
? Returned to a post office box.  
• Unnumbered or sequentially numbered invoices — An example of an invoice scam uses invoices 
numbered 101, 102, and 103, which are dated 30 days apart. Of course, it is highly

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.725 
unlikely that a legitimate business would refrain from issuing invoices in the interim. 
• Alterations — Copies of originals can be made for concealing alterations of original 
documents. Examples can include alterations or photocopies of backup papers.  
• Location and other information on the invoices that tie it to the suspected recipient — If the above 
steps still do not yield any suspect payments, return to the check registers and cash 
disbursement journals to look for discrepancies between the entries and the checks or 
backup documentation, or their absence. The register and journals might also indicate 
the purpose of payments made by wire, cashier’s check, or cash.
