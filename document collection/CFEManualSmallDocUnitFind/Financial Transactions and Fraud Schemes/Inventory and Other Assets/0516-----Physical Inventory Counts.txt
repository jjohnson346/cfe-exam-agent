Physical Inventory Counts 
Physical inventory counts can sometimes give rise to inventory theft detection. However, 
because other explanations satisfy inventory shortages (such as shrinkage), historical analysis 
of inventory is usually necessary. Furthermore, if the only method used to detect inventory 
fraud is the year-end physical count, the perpetrators will have had all year to devise 
concealment methods to circumvent potential detection.
