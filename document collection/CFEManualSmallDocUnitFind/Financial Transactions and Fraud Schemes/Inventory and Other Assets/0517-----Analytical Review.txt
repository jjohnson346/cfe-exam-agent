Analytical Review 
By using an analytical review, inventory fraud may be detected because certain trends 
become immediately clear. For example, if the cost of goods sold increases by a 
disproportionate amount relative to sales, and no changes occur in the purchase prices, 
quantities purchased, or quality of products purchased, the cause of the disproportionate 
increase in cost of goods sold might be one of two things: (1) ending inventory has been 
depleted by theft, or (2) someone has been embezzling money through a false billing scheme 
(i.e., submitting invoices and collecting the payments for inventory that was never delivered). 
 
An analytical review of all the component parts of the cost of goods sold should indicate to 
the examiner where to direct further inquiries. For example, assuming that the type of 
inventory purchased is the same and there is no change in the manufacturing process or 
purchase price, if sales and cost of sales change from $5,650,987 and $2,542,944 to

$6,166,085 and $2,981,880, respectively, what is the data telling the examiner? To begin, sales 
have increased by 9.12 percent whereas cost of sales increased by 17.26 percent. The profit 
margin has decreased by 3 percent (from 55 to 52 percent). Based on this data, the fraud 
examiner might want to look further at the components of inventory, such as beginning 
inventory, purchases, and ending inventory. If beginning inventory was $1,207,898, 
purchases were $2,606,518, and $2,604,972, respectively, and ending inventory was $894,564, 
then an inventory matrix would look like the following: 
 
 Year 1   Year 2  Percentage Change 
Beginning Inventory $1,207,898 $1,271,472  5.26% 
Purchases  2,606,518  2,604,972 <0.06%> 
Goods Available for Sale $3,814,416 $3,876,444  1.63% 
Ending Inventory <1,271,472>  < 894,564>  <29.64%> 
Cost of Sales $2,542,944 $2,981,880 17.26% 
 
Inventory purchases, as a percentage of sales, have declined from 46.13 to 42.25 percent. 
From this example, one can hypothesize that: (1) inventory purchases were purposely 
increased in year one only to be liquidated in year two, (2) the increased sales in year two 
were unexpected and the purchase of inventory did not keep pace with the sales, or (3) there 
might be some fraud scheme in inventory. If, by interview, the examiner is unable to 
ascertain a reasonable explanation such as (1) or (2) above, then further examination of the 
ending inventory may be warranted. 
 
The fraud examiner may next look at the differences in the physical inventory procedures, to 
see if that created a more (or less) accurate inventory count at the end of either year one or 
year two. If there is no other logical explanation, then further investigation into these and 
other inventory accounts may be necessary to explain the anomalies occurring in inventory.

analyt review
by us an analyt review inventori fraud mai be detect becaus certain trend
becom immedi clear for exampl if the cost of good sold increas by a
disproportion amount rel to sale and no chang occur in the purchas price
quantiti purchas or qualiti of product purchas the caus of the disproportion
increas in cost of good sold might be on of two thing 1 end inventori ha been
deplet by theft or 2 someon ha been embezzl monei through a fals bill scheme
ie submit invoic and collect the payment for inventori that wa never deliv
an analyt review of all the compon part of the cost of good sold should indic to
the examin where to direct further inquiri for exampl assum that the type of
inventori purchas is the same and there is no chang in the manufactur process or
purchas price if sale and cost of sale chang from 5650987 and 2542944 to
