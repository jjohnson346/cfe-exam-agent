Trapping Recruits 
In order to trap an employee of the target so that he is essentially forced to spy on his 
company, the recruiting spy will look for some sort of weakness in the potential recruit. 
Common examples include excessive gambling, drug or alcohol abuse, socially unacceptable 
sexual proclivities, past criminal convictions, and wild spending habits.  
 
Once a weakness has been identified in one of the target’s employees, the recruiting spy will 
do one of two things. If the recruit has some sort of chemical dependency or serious 
financial problem, the recruiting spy will typically finance the recruit’s weakness to the extent 
that the recruit becomes dependent on the spy’s favor. If the recruit has something 
embarrassing in his past such as a criminal record, the spy will more likely blackmail the 
recruit to force her to cooperate. In most situations, the recruiter starts as a friend, helping 
the target meet his needs, but later turns to blackmail to keep the recruit in line.  
 
Regardless of the method by which an employee is recruited, once that recruit has stolen or 
divulged a secret piece of information, the spy can easily keep that person in line and force 
them to continue spying. If the recruit tries to back out, the spy simply threatens to turn the 
recruit in to his employer or the police. The threat of losing his job, or possible criminal 
prosecution is usually sufficient to keep an otherwise hesitant recruit on a tight leash.
