A Closer Look at Databases 
There are three tiers of electronic databases: (1) The Internet, (2) InfoTrac databases and 
reference works like the Million Dollar Directory on CD-ROM, and (3) commercial 
databases such as Dialog, Profound, LexisNexis, and D&B (Dun & Bradstreet). 
 
Electronic Databases
 First Tier 
Examples:   
• The Internet 
Advantages:  
Quick, easy to use, usually free. 
Disadvantages:   
Chaotically organized, information 
not always current or reliable. 
 
Second Tier 
Examples:   
• InfoTrac 
• Million Dollar Directory 
• ACL 
Advantages:  
Fairly easy to use, available at large 
public libraries, usually free access, 
information reasonably reliable. 
Disadvantages:   
Expensive subscription rates, so 
not always practical as an in-house 
source for security units. 
 
 
Third Tier 
Examples:   
• Dialog 
• LexisNexis 
• D&B 
• Profound 
Advantages:  
Most use powerful search engines 
or have vast databases. Capable of 
highly refined conceptual searches. 
Disadvantages:   
Can be very expensive for 
intelligence and security units. 
However, these databases 
represent an emerging tool for the 
future.
