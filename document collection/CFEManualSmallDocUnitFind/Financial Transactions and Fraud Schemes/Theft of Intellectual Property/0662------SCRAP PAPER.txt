SCRAP PAPER 
Paper thrown away often contains valuable information about preliminary plans and reports. 
Hackers “dumpster dive” for this sort of information all the time. Often in the form of 
manuals, technical specifications, and instructions, these discarded documents can provide a 
road map to penetrate computer systems. They can also provide insight into evolving 
products or business plans of a target.
