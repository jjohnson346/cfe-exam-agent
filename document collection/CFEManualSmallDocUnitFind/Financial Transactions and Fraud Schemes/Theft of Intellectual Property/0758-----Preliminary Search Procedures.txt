Preliminary Search Procedures 
If an organization suspects that wiretapping has occurred, there are a number of preliminary 
search procedures that the layperson can perform. This section is not designed to make the 
reader an expert at counter-surveillance techniques; professionals who offer those services 
can easily be located. However, it is quite feasible for an ordinary person to conduct a basic 
search for wiretapping equipment. When conducting an inspection for electronic 
surveillance equipment, be mindful of safety concerns. Never reach into electrical boxes or 
outlets unless you are sure the power is off, and do not grasp bare wires unless you know 
they are not live.
