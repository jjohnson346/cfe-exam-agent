Deliveries and Shipments 
Deliveries and shipments should be made on as uniform a schedule as possible. Ideally, 
organizations should avoid scheduling major deliveries just before a product manufacturing 
run. This is just the sort of tip-off corporate spies are looking for. Maintaining adequate 
inventory levels can go a long way toward eliminating this problem. 
 
If the manufacturing process dictates tight parts delivery schedules, the use of a common 
carrier will at least mask the identity of the supplier to external surveillance. Utilizing a mix 
of common carriers and company trucks helps cloak shipments. Company drivers should be 
trained to vary their schedules and delivery routes. They should also be instructed to report 
any suspicions of intelligence gathering operations.
