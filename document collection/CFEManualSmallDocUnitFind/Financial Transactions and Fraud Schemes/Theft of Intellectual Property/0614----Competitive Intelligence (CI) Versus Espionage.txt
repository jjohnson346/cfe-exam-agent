Competitive Intelligence (CI) Versus Espionage 
History is used to the practice of intelligence, or what the Duke of Wellington described as 
“knowing what was over the other side of the hill.” Intelligence and espionage transferred 
from the military to a civilian setting with the return of service personnel from World War II 
and integrated itself with the economic environment through management education, which 
was focused on strategy and external influences.  
 
This approach to intelligence was formalized by one of the early proponents of business 
intelligence, Dr Gerald Albaum, who realized that companies had a need for a “more 
organized and systematic method for gathering, processing, analyzing, and reporting 
information about competitors.” 
 
CI has been defined as the analytical process that transforms disaggregated competitor data 
into relevant, accurate, and usable knowledge about competitors’ positions, performance, 
capabilities, and intentions. Yet in today’s market this is not enough. Companies are faced 
with three influencing factors: customers, competitors, and change. These forces are 
modifying the face of corporate strategy, driving the company of today deeper into 
unfamiliar and frightening territory. To address these fears, companies are now adopting 
organized business intelligence systems to monitor the environment in which they do 
business. 
 
CI is a legitimate business function that sits comfortably alongside marketing and research 
and development, as well as general business strategy and the newer discipline of knowledge 
management. It helps businesses to anticipate a competitor’s research and development 
strategy, determine its operating costs, pricing policies and financial strength, as well as its 
capacity. Knowledge about competitors is one of the advantages that can enable companies 
to succeed and lead the field in their respective market place. 
 
CI has become a growth industry that is practiced by professionals trained to use 
information in the public domain or to otherwise utilize legally available resources to 
compile information. This information is then collated, processed, and disseminated into 
intelligence that is usable and has strategic value. Gathering intelligence is not espionage, if 
the collection effort is done without recourse to criminal methods or intent. CI practitioners 
mostly work within a code of ethics drawn up by the Society for Competitive Intelligence 
Professionals (SCIP). This strict code includes the requirement that members identify 
themselves during an inquiry and do not use deception in their quest for such information.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.803 
To the detriment of the reputation of fraud examiners and CI professionals, certain private 
investigators and information brokers access financial and criminal information and other 
protected data, and generally disregard the laws governing data protection. Conversely, there 
are firms that will use quite aggressive techniques to investigate a client organization’s 
opponent. While not conforming to the SCIP’s code of ethics, these techniques are not 
illegal and firms using these methods appear to be prepared to stand by their techniques in a 
court of law. They provide a valuable service to their top-tier clients, many of whom do not 
believe that all evidence of malpractice is reflected solely in books and records. 
 
There is, therefore, a world of difference between competitive intelligence and espionage. 
Espionage may be defined as “intelligence activity directed toward the acquisition of  
information through clandestine means and proscribed by the laws of the country against which it is  
committed.” It does not cover legitimate intelligence collection and analysis using legal means. 
 
Espionage can be further sub-divided into industrial espionage and economic espionage 
Industrial espionage refers to the clandestine collection of information by companies and 
individuals, such as information brokers, about competitors. Economic espionage refers to 
state sponsored or sanctioned collection, which is often associated with a nation’s foreign 
intelligence service.
