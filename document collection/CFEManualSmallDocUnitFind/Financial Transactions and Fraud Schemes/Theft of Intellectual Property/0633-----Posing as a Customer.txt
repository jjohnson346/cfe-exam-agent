Posing as a Customer 
If a spy cannot cultivate or bribe key employees of a supplier, he may pose as a customer 
himself. He can exploit the two fundamental axioms of corporate espionage: (1) all 
salespeople want to make a sale, and (2) all salespeople will do almost anything to make a 
sale, including talking their heads off about what they’ve done for other customers.  
 
In a prospective sales meeting, the spy, armed with business cards and even a brochure 
about his “company,” conveys that he works for a prosperous business. (He can even pick a 
legitimate business with a good D&B rating and pose as its employee.) During the course of 
the meeting, he can ask what the supplier has done for other customers. He will casually 
mention that he has a friend who works for the target company. How well has the supplier 
served that business? As an additional enticemen t, the spy can place on the table impressive-
 looking spreadsheets showing financial data and production run levels and ask if the target’s 
level of business matches these figures. The spy tells the salesperson that he just wants to see 
if the supplier has the experience necessary to handle his business.
