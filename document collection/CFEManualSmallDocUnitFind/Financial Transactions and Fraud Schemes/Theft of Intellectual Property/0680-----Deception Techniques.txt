Deception Techniques
In many cases, spies are able to gather information from employees of a target without 
recruiting those employees in the surveillance campaign. Instead, the spy tricks the employee 
into revealing confidential information. Typical scams include using fake employment 
interviews, posing as a corporate headhunter, conducting bogus market research, soliciting 
contract bids on fictitious projects, and social engineering. Each of these scams is designed 
to get the employee to reveal sensitive information about his company’s business.
