WIRETAPS 
Wiretapping involves splicing a listening or recording device into a wire (such as a telephone 
wire, a PBX cable, an alarm system, or a local area network cable) that is used for 
communication by the target. Standard phone systems, in particular, are very vulnerable to 
wiretapping. Taps are usually placed at the telephone box in the basements of buildings, on 
lines outside buildings, or on telephone pole junction boxes near the target’s offices. The 
different types of wiretaps that can be utilized include: hardwired wiretap, soft wiretap, 
record wiretap, and transmit wiretap.
