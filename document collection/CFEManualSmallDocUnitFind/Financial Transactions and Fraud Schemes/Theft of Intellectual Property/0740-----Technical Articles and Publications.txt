Technical Articles and Publications  
Articles published by technical staff can create cavernous holes in an information security 
program. Staff may unintentionally leak sensitive information as part of an innocent 
academic exchange. The same is true for public speaking engagements. A policy of pre-
 publication review by security personnel and technical management is an absolute must.  
 
While pre-publication reviews of articles and speeches are certainly appropriate, 
organizations should not use technical articles and speeches as a method for disseminating 
misinformation. There are other means for conducting a counterespionage campaign that 
trammel less on issues such as freedom of expression, the right to academic inquiry, and the 
right to be fairly informed.
