Database Searches 
Computer databases are an excellent intelligence resource. Most security managers do not 
have the time to regularly read all the major national newspapers and business or technical 
magazines relevant to their client company. However, a security professional can go to the 
public library for a few hours once a month and scan magazine databases like InfoTrac for 
company references. A more efficient method is to subscribe to a clipping service, which will 
scan hundreds of articles from a variety of sources each month and provide articles 
containing any keywords (such as a company or employee name) that have been specified.

following key case topics:

The researcher should read all online abstracts and save any articles if further details are 
required. A picture will emerge of what is available in the public domain about the company. 
The security team should then evaluate how this information could work to an information 
thief’s advantage. 
 
More and more local newspapers are becoming electronically available via the Internet or 
through libraries. The astute security manager should use this resource to check for local 
criminal trends, locate mentions of the company and its officers, and perform background 
investigations on security risks.
