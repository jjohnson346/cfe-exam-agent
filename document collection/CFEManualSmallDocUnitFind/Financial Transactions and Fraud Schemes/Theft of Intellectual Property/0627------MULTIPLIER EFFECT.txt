MULTIPLIER EFFECT  
Analytical software produces a multiplier effect when processing case information. They 
generate output greater than the individual inputs of information. Facts A, B, C, and D 
standing by themselves may offer minimal insight, but when combined and organized those 
facts can generate an understanding of what is really going on in an organization. The 
Analyst’s Notebook by i2, for example, is popular among police intelligence analysts, 
because it can track patterns and linkages from large databases. (Further information about 
these types of products is contained in the “Data Analysis and Reporting Tools” chapter in 
the Investigation section of the Fraud Examiners Manual .) 
 
The functions performed by analytical software programs can easily be translated to business 
intelligence needs, uncovering patterns related to corporate filings, O/D searches, patent and 
trademark applications, and other diverse compilations of data that, when pieced together, 
can indicate the potential direction in which a competitor is headed. For example, some 
software programs can be designed to cross check patent authors extracted from a patent 
database against an Officer/Director search to show the companies for which key scientists 
serve as directors. The software also generates visual displays of the relationships between 
the companies. All of this makes the corporate spy’s task of unearthing hidden relationships 
and confidential facts easier.
