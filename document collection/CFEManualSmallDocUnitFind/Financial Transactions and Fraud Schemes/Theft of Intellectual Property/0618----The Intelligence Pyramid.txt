The Intelligence Pyramid 
Leonard Fuld, in his landmark book, Competitor Intelligence, argues that open sources exist at 
three levels, forming an Intelligence Pyramid. At the base of the pyramid are Fundamental 
Intelligence Techniques, the second level is composed of Basic Sources of Information, and 
the final level is Creative Sources.
