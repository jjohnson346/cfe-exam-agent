Hours of Operation and Power Consumption 
During highly sensitive manufacturing, testing, or research operations, the hours of 
operation and levels of power consumption should be kept as uniform as possible. Lights 
can be left on continuously, and some kind of around-the-clock activity can be maintained to 
mask sensitive operations.
