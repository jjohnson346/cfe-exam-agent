Second Tier Databases  
As indicated above, more in-depth, cleaner, and better organized data lies in middle tier 
databases such as Infotrac. While hypertext linking on the Web affords the user the ability to 
establish his own pathways through information, this mode of searching often leads to 
haphazard, lengthy, and even chaotic journeys. Middle tier databases provide well-organized, 
carefully indexed data that takes less time to search and carries a greater informational 
punch. Because intelligence frequently has a short half-life, time can be a very critical factor 
for intelligence specialists. The more quickly a search is completed, the more valuable is the 
information obtained.
