Pre-Recruitment Surveillance 
In developing human sources, spies know that they should never underestimate the 
importance of doing pre-recruitment surveillance on targets. There are a number of goals for 
this kind of surveillance. They include: 
• To discover: 
? Who they are 
? Where they live 
? What they do in their spare time 
? What they want to keep secret  
? Who their friends are 
? Who their enemies are 
• To look for: 
? Cars 
? Homes 
? Recreational activities 
? Levels of income and debts 
? The subject’s importance to the organization 
• To uncover what they throw in the trash. For example: 
? Financial papers 
? Medical problems 
? Family problems 
• To learn about their enemies, such as:  
? Ex-lovers 
? Fired employees 
? Political opponents
