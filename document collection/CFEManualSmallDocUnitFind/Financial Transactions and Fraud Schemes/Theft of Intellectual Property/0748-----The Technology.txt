The Technology 
In determining which technologies to employ, the spy must factor in environmental 
conditions such as lighting (if video surveillance is employed), noise levels, and distance from 
the source. Other factors include the risk of  the sensing device being discovered, power 
supply problems, and access to the device for servicing after installation.  
 
Common electronic eavesdropping devices include: 
• Drop-in telephone bugs  
• Carbon microphones 
• Magnetic or dynamic microphones 
• Electret microphone 
• Spike microphones 
• Cavity microphones 
• Low power consumption transmitters 
• Infinity transmitters  
• Shotgun or parabolic microphones  
• Cellular telephone receivers 
• Video cameras and transmitters 
• Satellite tracking of vehicles 
 
It is not difficult at all for spies to purchase electronic listening equipment. The Internet, for 
example, has a number of sites that advertise vast inventories of equipment ranging from 
audio devices to miniature video cameras to satellite tracking systems. Most of these sites 
urge their customers to use their merchandise only in a legally appropriate manner and 
advertise the equipment for purposes like checking for intruders or ensuring one’s own 
privacy. In truth, however, these devices can and are used by corporate spies to pilfer the 
proprietary secrets of their targets.  
 
Some of the more common forms of surveillance equipment are discussed in the following 
sections.
