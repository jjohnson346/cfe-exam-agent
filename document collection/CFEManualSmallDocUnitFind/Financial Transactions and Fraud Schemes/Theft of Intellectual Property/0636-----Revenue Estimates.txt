Revenue Estimates 
Revenue estimates can come from state air pollution control permit applications, hazardous 
materials permit applications, articles in the local press about sales volumes, state industrial 
directories, or by indirect methods. One of the most common indirect methods for 
estimating revenue is to count truck activity at a site, both receiving and shipping, over a 
given period of time. Knowing the shipping dimensions and retail costs of the company’s 
products, a spy can estimate what each truck holds. The same goes for railcars and ships or 
barges. Talking to truck drivers, railroad personnel, and longshoremen can also fill in details 
on the size of outgoing loads and their frequency. In the service industry, revenue estimates 
are frequently made by conducting interviews with suppliers, customers, or employees of the 
target. Pretext calls and social engineering might also be used to trick employees into 
divulging key financial information.
