INTERFACE BOX 
The interface box is a gray box typically located on the side of the building. If a business 
operates in a multiple occupancy structure, the interface box may be located in a utility closet 
close to the company’s offices. In order to ex amine the interface box, unscrew the side of 
the box that is designed for customer access. Look inside with a flashlight. All wiring in the 
box should look the same, using the colors red, blue, green, yellow, and black. You might see 
some striped wires, but that is fine. There should also be a line coming into the side of the 
box from the telephone company. What you should be looking for is a transmitter or some 
form of unusual wiring that does not appear to come from the telephone company and does 
not lead into your building or office. This could indicate a wiretap.
