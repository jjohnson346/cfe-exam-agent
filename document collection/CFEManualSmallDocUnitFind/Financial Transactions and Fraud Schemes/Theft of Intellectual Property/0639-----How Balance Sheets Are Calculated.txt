How Balance Sheets Are Calculated 
From these various sources, a competitive intelligence analyst can compile a preliminary 
income statement. The elements of a balance sheet derive from the income statement with 
the help of financial tools, such as D&B’s Industry Norms and Key Business Ratios. The 
process of deriving the balance sheet begins by taking a known figure (for instance, sales) 
and looking up the ratio, for the target’s industry, between sales and net worth. The 
intelligence professional simply needs to do some simple algebra (divide the sales figure by 
the ratio) to derive the unknown, which is the net worth.  
 
A similar procedure works for other standard ratios. The rule of thumb is that if a person 
knows the annual sales, the line of business (LOB), the number of employees, and how long 
a company has been in business, then that person will be able to create a reasonable balance 
sheet estimate. An analyst will compare the estimate against known or published balance 
sheets of similar size companies in the same LOB to check accuracy. Consulting experts on 
the industry (bank loan officers, investment analysts) provides further confirmation.
