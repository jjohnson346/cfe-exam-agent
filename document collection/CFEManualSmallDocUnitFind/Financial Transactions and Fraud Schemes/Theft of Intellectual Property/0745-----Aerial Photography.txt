Aerial Photography
Though its origins lie in the military sector, aerial photography has emerged as a valuable 
tool in business intelligence. Google Earth, a free, online tool that enables users to obtain an 
aerial photo of properties by satellite, has made gathering this type of intelligence quite easy. 
Additionally, there are private aerial photography firms that have fairly complete negatives 
for land in their service area. These firms also accept special assignments to photograph 
specific ground areas on a schedule specified by the client. Aerial photography is used by 
spies to gather information on a competitor’s construction or expansion products, to 
measure the size of its shipments, or to determine the number of employees that the 
company has working, among other things.
