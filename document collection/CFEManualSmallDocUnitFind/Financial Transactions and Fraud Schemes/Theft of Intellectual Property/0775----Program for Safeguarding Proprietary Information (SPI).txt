Program for Safeguarding Proprietary Information (SPI) 
Companies should develop a program for safeguarding proprietary information  (SPI). Businesses 
should seek out a corporate information officer (CIO) to develop and manage an SPI 
program. An alternative is to hire a security management consultant to develop a program 
and then maintain it on a yearly basis. In either case, the CIO should have information 
management skills and be knowledgeable about trade secret protection.
