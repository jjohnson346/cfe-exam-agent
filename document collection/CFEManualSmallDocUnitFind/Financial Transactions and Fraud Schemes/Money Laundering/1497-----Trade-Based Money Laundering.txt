Trade-Based Money Laundering 
Trade-based money laundering is generally the most complex of the money laundering 
methods. This method encompasses a variety of schemes, which utilize international trade to 
disguise the transfers of illicit funds. The most common method of trade-based money 
laundering is the Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE), a scheme where brokers purchase 
narcotics proceeds in the U.S. from the cartels and exchange them for clean pesos in 
Columbia. Other common trade-based money laundering methods include manipulating 
trade documents to over- and under-pay for imports and exports and using criminal 
proceeds to buy gems or precious metals.
