Money Services Businesses 
Money services businesses (MSBs) refer to non-depository financial service providers 
operating in one or more of the following capacities:  
• Currency exchangers;  
• Check cashers;  
• Issuers, sellers, or redeemers of traveler’s checks, money orders, or stored value;  
• The United States Postal Service; and  
• Money transmitters. 
 
MSBs offer an alternative to depository institutions for both financial services and money 
laundering. For this reason, an individual unable to transfer illegal funds into the U.S. 
banking system may turn to MSBs. In a ddition, most MSBs operate without federal 
regulatory supervision.
