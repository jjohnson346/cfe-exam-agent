SERVICES FOR NONACCOUNTHOLDERS 
Banks often issue cashier’s checks, money orders, and traveler’s checks and perform 
currency exchanges, wire transfers, or check cashing services. Strict identification 
requirements should be established for transactions with persons who are not regular bank 
customers. In fact, regulations require that in some instances banks keep a record of the 
identity of persons who are not established customers. Such regulations usually require at a 
minimum the person’s name and address, driver’s license number (or other number of 
identifying document produced), and Social Security number or employer identification 
number.
