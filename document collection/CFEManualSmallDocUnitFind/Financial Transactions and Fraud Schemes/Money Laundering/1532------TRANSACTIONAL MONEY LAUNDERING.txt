Section 1956(a)(1) provides that anyone who knows that property involved in a  
financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and conducts a 
financial transaction in any of the following ways:  
• With the intent to promote the carrying on of “specified unlawful activity” 
• With the intent to violate section 7201 (tax evasion) or 7206 (filing false return) of the 
Internal Revenue Code 
• Knowing that the transaction is designed to  conceal or disguise the nature, location, 
source, ownership, or control of the illegal proceeds 
• Knowing that the transaction is designed to avoid a reporting requirement 
 
Such individuals shall be fined up to $500,000 or twice the value of the monetary instrument 
or funds (whichever is greater) and/or imprisoned for not more than 20 years. “Specified 
unlawful activity” is defined in § 1956(c)(7) and includes a long list of federal crimes 
including RICO, fraud, embezzlement, theft, and false statements. Also, funds that are 
illegally transmitted in violation of this statute or any property traceable to those funds are
