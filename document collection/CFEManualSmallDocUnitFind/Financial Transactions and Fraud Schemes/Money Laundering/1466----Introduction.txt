Introduction 
Money laundering is the disguising of the existence, nature, source, ownership, location, and 
disposition of property derived from criminal activity. Although it is not currently possible 
to quantify the total volume of money laundered globally or in the U.S., it is clearly an 
enormous problem existing within every financial system. Nevertheless, the continuing 
demand to know how much money is laundered annually has led many organizations to 
calculate and offer their own estimations. For example, the International Monetary Fund 
estimated that money laundering caused a total monetary loss of $590 billion to $1.5 trillion 
globally in 1996, the United Nations estimated a loss of $500 billion to $1 trillion globally in 
2005, and a 2007 KPMG survey found that money-laundering flows exceed $1 trillion per 
year. 
 
The “washing” of money includes all forms of illegal activities. In most instances the goal is 
to conduct transactions in cash (currency) in such a way as to conceal the true nature of 
transactions. Problems occur regarding large volumes of cash, transporting it, converting 
small denomination bills to larger denomination bills, and converting cash into assets that 
can be invested or spent. Money laundering is generally accomplished in three stages: (1) 
placement; (2) layering; and (3) integration.
