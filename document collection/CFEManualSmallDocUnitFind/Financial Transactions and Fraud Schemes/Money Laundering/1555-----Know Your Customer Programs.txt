“Know Your Customer” Programs 
Most financial institutions have “Know Your Customer” programs as part of their BSA 
compliance program. Such programs should provide for effective customer identification, 
account monitoring, and appropriate action in suspicious circumstances. Both the CTR 
reporting requirements and the recordkeeping requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act 
mandate the identification of customers using the institution’s services.
