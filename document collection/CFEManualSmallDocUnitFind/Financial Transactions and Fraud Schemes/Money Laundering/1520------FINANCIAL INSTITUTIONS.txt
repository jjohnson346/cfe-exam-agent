FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
The BSA also requires financial institutions to monitor suspicious activity and file suspicious 
activity reports (SARs) to disclose known or suspected criminal offenses or transactions that 
involve money laundering or violate the Act. For years, suspicious transactions were 
reported on the Currency Transaction Report (CTR). However, such activity is now reported 
using the Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). 
 
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which charters, regulates, and 
supervises more than 2,500 national banks, adopted a requirement mandating that national 
banks file SARs with the appropriate federal law enforcement agencies and the Treasury

Department, in accordance with the form’s instructions, by sending the reports to the 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). These reporting requirements are found 
in Title 12, Part 353 of the Code of Federal Regulations. This is an enormous improvement 
on the old reporting systems because it establishes a centralized reporting system that is 
shared throughout government agencies simultaneously. The DEA, for instance, can now 
access the same information as the IRS when working on a suspicious report. The reporting 
procedure has also been simplified for banks, making the information much easier for the 
Department of the Treasury to obtain.  
 
Financial institutions are also required to use SAR forms to report incidents of computer 
intrusion. The term “computer intrusion” is defined as gaining access to the computer 
system to remove, steal, or procure customers’  funds or other account information, or to 
access the institution’s computer system with the intention of damaging or disabling any 
critical computer systems. 
 
SARs are used to report a known or suspected criminal offense or a transaction that involves 
money laundering or violates the BSA. More specifically, a SAR must be filed with FinCEN 
in each of the following instances: 
• Any known or suspected criminal violation involving the financial institution when the 
institution has a substantial basis for identifying one of its directors, officers, employees, 
agents, or affiliated parties as having committed the act or aided in its commission. 
• Any known or suspected criminal violation involving the financial institution and 
aggregating $5,000 or more when the institution has a substantial basis for identifying a 
possible suspect or group of suspects. 
• Any known or suspected criminal violation involving the financial institution and 
aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of whether the institution has a substantial basis 
for identifying possible suspects. 
• Any transaction conducted or attempted to be conducted through the financial 
institution when the institution has reason to suspect that (1) the funds were derived 
from illegal activities, (2) the transaction is designed to evade any regulations under the 
Bank Secrecy Act, or (3) the transaction appears to have no business purposes or appears 
unusual in normal banking practice. 
 
When a financial institution reports a suspicious transaction to a government agency, the Act 
(18, U.S.C., § 5318(g)(2)) makes it illegal for the financial institution to notify any person 
involved in the suspicious transaction that such a report has been made.

Section 5318(g)(3) of the BSA also contains a safe harbor provision for financial institutions 
that report suspicious transactions or that make voluntary disclosures to a government 
agency of any other possible violation of a law or regulation. The Act provides that these 
financial institutions shall not be liable under any law, regulation, or contract to any person 
for making the report. Note that this safe harbor provision only applies to reports made to 
government agencies, not to self-regulatory organizations.
