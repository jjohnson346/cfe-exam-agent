Bank Secrecy Act Compliance Programs 
Most financial institutions are now required to have a Bank Secrecy Act compliance program 
in place. However, every business that has the potential for transactions dealing with 
significant amounts of cash should institute a compliance program and a money laundering 
awareness program. All employees should be made aware of the money laundering statutes 
and the serious implications of such laws on the institution and the employees. Employees 
should be educated to be aware of transactions that might suggest possible laundering 
activity. Procedures should be set out detailing what an employee should do if a customer or 
transaction appears suspicious.
