BACK-TO-BACK LOAN SCHEMES 
As with loan-back schemes, money launderers often use back-to-back loan schemes to 
purchase property. In a back-to-back loan scheme, a money launderer obtains a loan by 
presenting collateral, which originated from illicit funds, to a financial institution. Like the 
loan-back scheme, this technique gives the loaned money the appearance of a genuine loan.
