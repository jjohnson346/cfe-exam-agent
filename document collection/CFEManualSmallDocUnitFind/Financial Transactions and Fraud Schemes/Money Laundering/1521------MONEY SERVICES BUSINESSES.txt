MONEY SERVICES BUSINESSES 
Even before the passage of the PATRIOT Act, the Treasury Department was in the process 
of expanding its reporting guidelines to include businesses that did not fall under the 
traditional definition of financial institutions but nevertheless perform a myriad of financial 
services. One of these categories included money services businesses (MSBs), which comprise 
various types of money transmitters, issuers of money orders and traveler’s checks, and 
check cashing businesses. MSBs have long been  required to file CTRs, but otherwise very 
little government regulation has been required.  
 
In August 1999, many of the reporting and registration obligations contained in the Bank 
Secrecy Act were extended to MS Bs. These businesses are now required to register with 
FinCEN under Chapter 31, C.F.R. part 103, subchapter D. Those that fail to register can 
incur substantial penalties.  
 
Under the rules (1) money transmitters, (2) issuers, sellers, and redeemers of money orders, 
(3) issuers, sellers, and redeemers of traveler’s checks, and (4) the U.S. Postal Service (except 
with regard to the sale of postage or philatelic products) are required to report certain classes 
of transactions that meet certain dollar thresholds to the Department of the Treasury after 
January 1, 2002.  
 
The reportable transactions include: 
• Transactions involving funds derived from illegal activity or intended or conducted in 
order to hide or disguise funds or assets derived from illegal activity; 
• Transactions designed, whether through structuring or other means, to evade the 
requirements of the BSA;  
• Transactions that appear to serve no business or apparent lawful purpose; and 
• Transactions that involve the use of a mutual fund to facilitate criminal activity. 
Financial Transactions  Money Laundering 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1629 
The rule includes two different dollar thresholds depending on the stage and type of 
transaction involved: 
• For transactions conducted or attempted by, at, or through a money service business or 
its agent, a threshold of $2,000 applies; 
• For transactions identified by issuers of money orders or traveler’s checks from a review 
of clearance records or other similar records of instruments that have been sold or 
processed, a threshold of $5,000 applies. 
 
MSBs are given 30 days after becoming aware of a suspicious transaction to complete a 
Suspicious Activity Report by Money Services  Business (SAR-MSB; Form 109) and file it 
with FinCEN; in situations involving violations that require immediate attention, such as 
ongoing money laundering schemes, the MSB or MSBs are to notify the appropriate law 
enforcement authority immediately, by telephone, in addition to filing the required form. 
Supporting documentation relating to each SAR-MSB is to be collected and maintained by 
the reporting MSB for review as needed by law enforcement and regulatory agencies. 
Although the SAR-MSB form is not formatted for joint filing, MSBs may be included as 
joint filers with other reporting financial institutions.
