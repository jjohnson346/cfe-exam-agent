Overstatement of Reported Expenses 
The disadvantage of overstating revenues is that taxes will be due on the reported income. 
Therefore, if a company overstates its revenue, it will also want to overstate its expenses to 
offset its tax liability. The fictitious expenses also enable the perpetrator to siphon money 
out of the business in order to make payoffs, buy illegal goods, or invest in other  
criminal ventures. 
 
Overstating expenses can be accomplished very easily by reporting payments for supplies 
never received, professional services never rendered, or wages for fictitious employees. 
 
EXAMPLE 
ABC Used Cars reports wages for three mechanics and an assistant manager who do 
not exist. The company also reports payments of over $200,000 a year to several 
lawyers, accountants, and other “consultants” who do little, if any, actual work. 
 
Income statement laundering, which includes both overstated revenues and expenses, can be 
difficult to detect. When artificial price inflation is applied in moderate percentages to goods 
and services whose market value is difficult to establish (e.g., artwork, used cars, consulting 
fees, advertising expenses), detection is exceedingly difficult without inside information. 
Complete fabrication of transactions, on the other hand, or creation of “ghost” employees is 
somewhat easier to spot.
