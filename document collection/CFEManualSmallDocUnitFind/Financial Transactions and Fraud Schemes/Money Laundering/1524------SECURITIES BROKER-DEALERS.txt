SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS 
In 2002, FinCEN announced a rule requiring brokers and dealers in securities to report 
suspicious activity via a Suspicious Activity Report by Securities and Futures Industries 
(SAR-SF; FinCEN Form 101). These firms are obligated to report suspicious transactions 
conducted or attempted by, at, or through a broker-dealer and involve or aggregate at least 
$5,000 in funds or assets. This requirement took effect December 31, 2002. 
 
Brokers and dealers in securities are required to report to FinCEN transactions that fall into 
one of the four categories below. Again, these categories are substantially similar to those 
that trigger reports by money service businesses and mutual funds (see above). 
• Transactions involving funds derived from illegal activity, or intended or conducted in 
order to hide or disguise funds derived from illegal activity; 
• Transactions designed, whether through structuring or other means, to evade the 
requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act; 
• Transactions that appear to serve no business or apparent lawful purpose or are not the 
sort of transactions in which the particular customer would be expected to engage, and 
for which the broker-dealer knows of no reasonable explanation after examining the 
available facts; or 
• Transactions that involve the use of the broker-dealer to facilitate criminal activity. 
 
Broker-dealers are also required to establish anti-money laundering programs that, among 
other things, are designed to detect suspicious transactions, under recently promulgated self-regulatory 
organization (SRO) rules. The SEC has the authority to examine broker-dealers 
for compliance with the rule, and it is expected that the SROs will also be reviewing 
compliance as part of the enforcement of their rules. 
 
A copy of SAR-SF is included at the end of the chapter.
