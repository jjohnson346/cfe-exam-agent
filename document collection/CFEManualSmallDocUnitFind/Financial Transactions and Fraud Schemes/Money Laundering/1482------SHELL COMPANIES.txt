SHELL COMPANIES 
Money launderers often use shell companies, which are discussed in more detail below, to 
purchase real estate. Generally defined, shell companies are business entities, including 
limited liability companies, trusts, business trusts, and corporations, without active business 
or significant assets. Because there is a lack of transparency in the formation of shell 
companies, money launderers often use them to hide the identity of the true owner, the 
source of the money, or the destination of the money.
