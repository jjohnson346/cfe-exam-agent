Inoculation 
This is a totally different approach to virus detection. Instead of looking for the viruses 
themselves, this technique looks for the changes that the viruses make to files and boot 
sectors. Starting with a clean system, the software “inoculates” each boot sector and 
program file by storing a snapshot of information about it based on its content and size. 
Then, periodically, it reexamines these files to see if anything has changed. If it has, then the 
utility will inform the user; if the user hasn’t made the change, the virus may have. 
 
The main advantage of this type of virus detection is that since it is looking at the effects of 
the virus, it doesn’t need to know what the virus itself is; this means it will detect even new 
viruses without requiring updated virus definition files all of the time. The disadvantage, and 
why it is not used that often, is that it generates a substantial amount of false positives.

themselv thi techniqu look for the chang that the virus make to file and boot
