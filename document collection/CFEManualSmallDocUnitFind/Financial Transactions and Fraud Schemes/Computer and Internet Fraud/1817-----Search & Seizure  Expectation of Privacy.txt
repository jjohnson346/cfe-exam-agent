Search & Seizure — Expectation of Privacy 
The first question that should be asked in a computer fraud examination pertains to the 
expectation of privacy for any employee or outsider who might be involved in the incident.  
 
For example, in one incident an employee was caught using a company computer for 
personal use. The company had never established computer use policies. The employee had 
never been formally notified that personal use of the computer was prohibited and that the 
company had the right to inspect the contents of the computer at any time. Therefore, when 
a supervisor discovered inappropriate personal files on the employee’s computer, the 
employee protested the act as an invasion of his privacy.

This demonstrates that appropriate policies can be critical. In the above circumstances the 
company might have created a situation where they would actually need to obtain a court 
order or a search warrant through a law enforcement agency just to examine the contents of 
their own computers. 
 
There is specific wording that should be used in the construction of a search warrant 
involving either computers or telecommunications equipment. How the equipment and 
magnetic media are described will be critical to the success of the court case.
