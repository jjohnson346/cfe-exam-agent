Worms 
A worm is a self-replicating program that resides as a file on a system, executes an 
autonomous process, and deliberately moves from system to system. It looks for other 
nodes on the networks, copies itself to them, and causes the self-copy to execute on other 
nodes. These programs find network utilities showing node names, monitor network traffic, 
and randomly select network identification codes as well as other mischief. 
 
An example of a worm is the SQL Slammer, which raced across the globe and wreaked havoc 
on the Internet in January 2003. This worm doubled the number of computers it infected 
every 8.5 seconds in the first minute of its appearance. The worm, which exploited a flaw in 
Microsoft Corporation’s SQL Server database software, caused damage by rapidly replicating 
itself and clogging the pipelines of the global data network. The worm did not erase or cause 
damage to desktop computers, but was designed to replicate itself so fast and so effectively 
that no other traffic could get through networks.
