“Mirror” Copies 
If possible, the fraud examiner should make an exact duplicate, or “mirror” copy, of any 
media that is to be analyzed. This will ensure that no changes or damage occurs to the 
original evidence. This will not be possible in all cases due to a lack of equipment or other 
resources, but should be considered as the “ideal” procedure. 
 
When there is no alternative but to analyze the original of the seized evidence, consideration 
should be given to using utility software to “lock” the disk so that no information can be 
written to the disk. This will protect the integrity of the original evidence, and prevent 
inadvertent alteration of the original data.
