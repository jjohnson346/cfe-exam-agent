Applying Encryption to E-Commerce Security 
Generally speaking, the solutions offered by conventional and public-key encryption 
technologies are usually adequate to ensure that e-commerce transactions are as secure as the 
value of transactions requires.  
 
The vast majority of transmissions over the Internet and the World Wide Web are not 
encrypted in any way. If there is no need to hide the contents of a message or 
communication, there is little need to expend resources on the encryption of such traffic and 
the decryption at the other end. Encryption can be an expensive solution, whether in terms 
of actual monetary cost or the cost in increased computational load on the users’ machines. 
The needs of the organization to keep confidential transmissions secret should be weighed 
against the effort and cost of encryption.
