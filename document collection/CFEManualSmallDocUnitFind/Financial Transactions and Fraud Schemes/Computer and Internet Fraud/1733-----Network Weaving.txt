Network Weaving 
This technique, more commonly known as looping, involves using numerous networks in an 
attempt to avoid detection. For example, a hacker might dial into Company A’s PBX system 
to obtain an outside line that can be used to dial into Company B’s network. If Company B 
can track the origin of the hacker’s call, it w ill lead them to Company A, not to the hacker.

The above is a relatively simple example. Hackers have been known to “loop” through 15 or 
20 different networks before arriving at their final destination. Network weaving can make it 
extremely difficult for an investigator or fraud examiner to trace the point of origin for a 
specific telephone call or data transmission.
