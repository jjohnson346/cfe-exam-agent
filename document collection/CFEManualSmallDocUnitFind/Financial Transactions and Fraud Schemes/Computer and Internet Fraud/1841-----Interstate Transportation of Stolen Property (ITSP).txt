Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property (ITSP) (Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 2314) 
The ITSP statute prohibits the transportation, transmittal, or transfer of fraudulently 
received goods, wares, merchandise, securities, or money in interstate or foreign commerce, 
when valued at $5,000 or more. Prosecutors of ten use the ITSP statute in fraud prosecutions 
in conjunction with mail fraud counts, wire fraud counts, or to provide federal jurisdiction in 
their absence. To apply, the ITSP statute requires that an individual transport the proceeds, 
which must value at least $5,000, across state lin es. Defendants also violate the statute if they 
induce their victim(s) to travel in interstate commerce as part of the scheme to defraud. 
Courts may aggregate items valued at less than $5,000 as part of the same scheme to meet 
the value requirement. 
 
Additionally, it is clear that section 2314 applies when defendants steal tangible items, which 
qualify as goods, wares, or merchandise, that contains intellectual property. However, courts 
have had varying opinions on the characterization of intellectual property as “goods, wares, 
merchandise, securities, or money” when an individual steals intangible property through 
intangible means.
