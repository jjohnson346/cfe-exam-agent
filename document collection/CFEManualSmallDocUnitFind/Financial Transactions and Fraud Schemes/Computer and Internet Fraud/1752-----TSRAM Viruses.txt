TSRAM Viruses 
Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) viruses usually hide in memory and cause system crashes, 
depending on their memory location. The TSR takes control of the operating system by 
passing its request to DOS each time DOS is executed. The virus Cascade B is a TSR virus 
that sometimes causes the system to crash. It also causes characters to fall down the screen.
