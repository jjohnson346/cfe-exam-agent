Spamming  
Spamming  involves sending e-mail to subscribers whose names appear on electronic versions 
of the phone list and posting ads to the plethora of discussion and chat groups using the 
Internet. These postings are often disguised to look like tips from individual citizens who 
 are supposedly engaged in a lawful enterprise, when in fact they are part of an Internet 
boiler room.
