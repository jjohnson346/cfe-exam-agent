System Software 
Controls over system software include those that govern the installation of the computer 
system, the communications software, and the security software. Data center management 
should approve the system software selection as well as the chosen options and parameters. 
System software should be tested before implementation in a production environment. 
(Note that this might not be possible for the operating system itself.)
