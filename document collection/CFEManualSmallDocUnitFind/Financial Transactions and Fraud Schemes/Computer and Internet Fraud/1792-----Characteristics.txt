Characteristics 
The characteristics of the traditional inside computer fraudster are very similar to those of 
the hacker or other computer criminal: intelligent, hard working, seldom takes time off, 
bored with the routine of the job, and has a very large ego. Many computer technicians have 
demonstrated a greater loyalty to the technology than to the organization for which they 
work. This technology loyalty can create an attitude that any behavior is acceptable if it is in 
the name of technology.  
 
The following are indicators of insider computer fraud: 
• Access privileges beyond those required to perform assigned job functions. 
• Exception reports not reviewed and resolved. 
• Access logs not reviewed. 
• Production programs run at unusual hours. 
• Lack of separation of duties in the data center.
