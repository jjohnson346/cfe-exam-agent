Digital Millennium Copyright Act (Title 17, U.S. Code, Sections 1201-1205) 
The advent of the Internet and digital media has led to an increase in intellectual copyright 
infringement. In response to this development, Congress enacted the Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA). The DMCA outlaws the use of computers (and other 
electronic devices) to infringe against copyright holders’ exclusive rights. To further this goal, 
the DMCA provides liability limitations for transmitting copyrighted material online. The 
DMCA also provides criminal penalties for circumventing copyright protection systems, 
which are set forth in section 1201, and for compromising the integrity of copyright 
management information pursuant to section 1202.  
 
Violations under either section 1201 or 1202  are subject to a maximum of five years 
imprisonment, up to $500,000 fine, or both. Subsequent offenses are subject to a maximum 
of 10 years, a maximum fine of $1,000,000, or both.
