Data Files 
Controls over data files ensure that correct files are used for each production job and that 
adequate backup files exist. Data-file label bypass options should be disabled. A data file 
management system should be used to record and locate all data files. Data file backup 
copies should be made and stored in a secure facility. Off-site backup file copies should be 
maintained in case of a disaster in the data center. Utilities that can modify data files should 
be removed from the system and used only under management supervision. Live data files 
should not be used for testing.
