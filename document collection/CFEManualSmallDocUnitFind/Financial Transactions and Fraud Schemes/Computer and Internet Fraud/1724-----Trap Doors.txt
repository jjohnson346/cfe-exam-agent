Trap Doors 
When developing large programs, programmers insert instructions for additional code and 
intermediate output capabilities. The design of computer operating systems attempts to 
prevent this from happening. Therefore, programmers insert instructions that allow them to 
circumvent these controls. Hackers take advantage of these trap doors.
