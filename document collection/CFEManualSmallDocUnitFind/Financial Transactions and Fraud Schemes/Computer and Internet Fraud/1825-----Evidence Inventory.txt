Evidence Inventory 
Many times computers seized as evidence are only inventoried according to the information 
available on the outside of the CPU case — namely the make, model, and serial number of 
the particular unit. The components inside the CPU case are never examined. Fraud 
examiners must consider that there could literally be thousands of dollars of equipment 
inside this case. Inadequate inventories of computer equipment leave the organization, and 
possibly the fraud examiner, in a precarious liability position should any of this equipment be 
damaged or lost.
