Effective Security  
Effective computer security ensures the availability of accurate data in time to meet an 
organization’s needs at a cost that is commen surate with the risks involved. Key elements 
are: 
• Protecting data and programs from intentional or inadvertent unauthorized alteration or 
destruction. 
• Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. 
• Protecting the data center from physical threats such as fire, flood, and intentional 
destruction.  
• Having the capability to restore data center operations in case of complete destruction. 
 
The most important step is to obtain management support for effective security. Without 
such support, any security plan will falter.
