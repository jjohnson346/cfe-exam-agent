Salami Techniques 
Salami techniques involve the execution of unauthorized programs used to steal small 
amounts of assets from a large number of sources without noticeably reducing the whole. 
For example, in a banking system, the amount of interest to be credited to an account is 
typically rounded off. A fraudster might set up the system so that instead of rounding off the 
number, that fraction of it is credited to a special account owned by the perpetrator.
