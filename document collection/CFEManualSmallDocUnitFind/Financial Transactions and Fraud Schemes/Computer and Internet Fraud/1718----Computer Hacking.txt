Computer Hacking 
As the number of computers and computer users increases, so does the number and types of 
hackers. A 2007 study by the University of Ma ryland’s A. James Clark School of Engineering 
reported that hackers attack computers with Internet connections every 39 seconds, or about 
2,244 times a day. In addition, a 2007 research report conducted by WhiteHat, a website 
security services provider, showed that as many as 90 percent of all websites remain 
vulnerable to some form of computer hack.  
 
Although the term hacker was originally used to describe a computer enthusiast, the term has 
now evolved to mean someone seeking unauthorized access to computer systems and the 
information contained therein. It includes organizations’ employees, members of hacker 
gangs, and hackers for profit. Motives vary according to the targeted system, information 
desired, and the perpetrator. While hacking was once commonly thought of as a precocious 
teenager’s hobby, it has changed dramatically in the last twenty years to encompass a large 
and diverse group.
