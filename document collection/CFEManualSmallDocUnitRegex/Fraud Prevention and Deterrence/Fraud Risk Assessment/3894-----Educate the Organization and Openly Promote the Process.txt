Sponsors should be strongly encouraged to openly promote the process. The more 
personalized the communication from the sponsor, the more effective it will be in 
encouraging employees to participate in the process. Whether it is a video, a town hall 
meeting, or a companywide e-mail, the communication should be aimed at eliminating any 
reluctance employees have about participating in the fraud risk assessment process.
