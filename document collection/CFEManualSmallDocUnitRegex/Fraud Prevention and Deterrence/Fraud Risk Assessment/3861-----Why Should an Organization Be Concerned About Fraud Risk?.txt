Why Should an Organization Be Concerned About Fraud Risk?  
Every organization is vulnerable to fraud; there is no organization that has immunity to that 
risk. The key to reducing that vulnerability is to be consciously aware and realistic about 
what the organization’s weaknesses are. Only  then can management ensure that it can 
establish mechanisms that effectively prevent or detect fraudulent activities. 
 
Organizational stakeholders expect their stewards to be thoughtful and prudent about 
protecting the business. However, even when tales of fraudsters are getting a lot of public 
attention, many organizations still have difficulty facing the realities of how susceptible they 
really are to fraud.  
 
There are many factors that influence how at risk an organization is to fraud. Some of the 
bigger factors are:  
• The business it is in 
• The environment in which it operates 
• The effectiveness of the internal controls within the business processes 
• The ethics and values of the company and the people within it
