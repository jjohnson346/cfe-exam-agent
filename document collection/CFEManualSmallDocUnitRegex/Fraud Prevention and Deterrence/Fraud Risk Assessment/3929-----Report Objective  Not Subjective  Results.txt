Report Objective — Not Subjective — Results  
A lot of instinct and judgment goes into performing the fraud risk assessment. When 
reporting the results of the assessment, the team must stick to the facts and keep all opinions 
and biases out of the report. A report that is peppered with the assessment team’s subjective 
perspective will dilute and potentially undermine the results of the work.
