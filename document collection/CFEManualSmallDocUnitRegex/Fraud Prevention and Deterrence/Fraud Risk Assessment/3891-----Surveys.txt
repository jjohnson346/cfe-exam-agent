Surveys  
Surveys can be anonymous or directly attributable to individuals. Sometimes people will 
share more openly when they feel protected behind a computer or paper questionnaire. In 
an organization where the culture is not one where people open up and freely talk, an 
anonymous survey can be a great way to get feedback. However, employees can be skeptical 
about the true anonymity of a survey, especially in organizations that use surveys to solicit 
feedback anonymously but send follow-up e-mails to individual delinquent respondents. If 
the assessor determines that an anonymous survey is an appropriate technique to use in the

fraud risk assessment, he should clearly and explicitly explain to employees how anonymity 
will be maintained.
