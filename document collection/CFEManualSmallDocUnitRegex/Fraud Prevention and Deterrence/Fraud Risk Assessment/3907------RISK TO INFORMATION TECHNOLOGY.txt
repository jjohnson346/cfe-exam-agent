Fraud Risk Assessment

RISK TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY  
Information technology (IT) is a critical component of fraud risk assessment. Organizations 
rely on IT to conduct business, communicate, and process financial information. A poorly 
designed or inadequately controlled IT environment can expose an organization to threats to 
data integrity, threats from hackers to system security, and theft of financial and sensitive 
business information. Whether in the form of hacking, economic espionage, Web 
defacement, sabotage of data, viruses, or unauthorized access to data, IT fraud risks can 
result in significant financial and information losses.
