What Is Fraud Risk? 
Cressey’s fraud triangle teaches us that there are three interrelated elements that enable 
someone to commit fraud: the motive  that drives a person to want to commit the fraud, the 
opportunity  that enables him to commit the fraud, and the ability to rationalize  the fraudulent 
behavior. The vulnerability that an organization has to those capable of overcoming all three 
elements of the fraud triangle is fraud risk. Fraud risk can come from sources both internal 
and external to the organization.
