Sample Fraud Risk Assessment Framework #2 — Fraud Risk Index  
The following is a suggested framework that has two components: the Fraud Risk Index, 
which looks at indicators of areas that put the organization at risk for fraud, and the 
Leadership Risk Profile, which examines the way business leaders operate to help determine 
if they behave or conduct business in a way that can increase the company’s risk of fraud.
