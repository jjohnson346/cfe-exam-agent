Social Control Theory  
Travis Hirschi, in his 1969 book, Causes of Delinquency, first articulated the social control theory. A 
particularly important reason for the current dominance of control theory as the 
interpretative scheme for understanding crime and delinquency is that, unlike theories such 
as differential association, it offers a considerable number of testable propositions. Such

propositions take the form of if-then statements: if something exists or is done, then it 
foretells that something will follow. Such formulations allow for experimental testing  
and rebuttal. 
 
Control theory takes its cue from a classic of sociology, Emile Durkheim’s Suicide, in which 
the French theoretician wrote:  
 
The more weakened the groups to which [the individual belongs], the less he depends on 
them, the more he consequently depends on him self and recognizes no other rules of conduct 
than what are founded on his private interests (Durkheim, 1951, p. 209). 
 
Essentially, control theory argues that the institutions of the social system train and press 
those with whom they are in contact into patterns of conformity. Schools train for 
adjustment in society, peers press the ethos of success and conventional behavior, and 
parents strive to inculcate law-abiding habits in their youngsters—even, Hirschi stresses, 
parents who themselves play fast and loose with the rules. The theory rests on the thesis that 
to the extent that a person fails to become attached to the variety of control agencies of the 
society, his chances of violating the law are increased. This doctrine edges very close to being 
self-evident in its insistence that close affiliation with law-abiding people, groups, and 
organizations is predictive of law-abiding behavior; however, it is notably rich with 
subordinate statements, some of them far from obvious. 
 
Four aspects of affiliation are addressed by the theory:  
• Attachment 
• Commitment 
• Involvement 
• Belief  
 
Attachment  refers primarily to affection-type ties with people such as parents, teachers, and 
peers. Commitment refers to cost factors involved in criminal activity. People are committed to 
conventional behavior and probably have invested something — fiscally and emotionally — in 
their ultimate success — an investment that they are wary of risking by means of a criminal 
act. Commitment might involve things such as obtaining a better job or seeing one’s children 
succeed. Involvement concerns matters such as time spent on the job — that is, participation in 
activities related to future goals and objectives. Belief refers to a conviction about the

legitimacy of conventional values, such as the law in general and criminal justice 
prescriptions in particular. 
 
Hirschi insists that there is no important relationship between social class and delinquency 
and crime; thus, a person in any class—lower, middle, or upper—who defaults on liaisons 
with the important formative agencies in our society will be more apt to find himself on a 
path that ends in crime. Among the important considerations, control theory stresses 
strongly, is “the bond of affection for conventional persons.” “The stronger this bond, the 
more likely the person is to take it into account when and if he contemplates a criminal act” 
(Hirschi, 1969, p. 83). What essentially happens, the theory suggests, is that people 
confronted with the possibility of behaving in a law-violative manner are likely to ask of 
themselves: “What will my wife — or my mother and father — think if they find out?” To the 
extent that individuals believe that other people whose opinions are important to them will 
be disappointed or ashamed, and to the extent that they care deeply that these people will 
feel this way, they will be constrained from engaging in the sanctioned behavior.
