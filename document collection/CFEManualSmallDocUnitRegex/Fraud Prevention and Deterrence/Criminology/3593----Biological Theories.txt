Biological Theories 
Biological theories  maintain that criminal behavior is not the result of choice (the calculation of 
benefits and potential losses), but rather is caused by the physical traits of those who commit 
crime. The foundations of biological theory were laid by Cesare Lombroso, an Italian doctor, 
who insisted that there were born criminals— people who were atavistic, or a throwback to 
more primitive human types. Lombroso spent his career measuring the bodies of offenders 
and concluded that they were marked by a high degree of asymmetry, with such things as 
sloping foreheads and other “anomalies.” Later critics would point out that Lombroso used 
no control group—that is, he did not measure people who were not criminals. If he had 
done so, he would have found that they shared equally in those kinds of traits that 
Lombroso presumed were indicative of criminal propensities. 
 
Biological theory continues to flourish today, with theorists seeking to locate genetic 
distinctions between those who break the law and those who obey it. In their book, The Bell 
Curve, Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray argue that low intelligence and crime are 
intimately connected and that low intelligence (as measured by I.Q. scores) is genetically 
transmitted. Some scholars in the field savaged the Herrnstein-Murray position, but it 
received a good deal of media attention. 
 
Biological theorists now take a much less deterministic position than Lombroso. They will 
point to this or that human characteristic and say that it, given certain environmental 
circumstances, is apt to produce illegal acts. Put another way, they report that they have 
found a large number of offenders with a biological trait, but that there are many more that 
have the trait who never get into any trouble with the law.
