Psychological Theories 
Theories rooted in psychology are based on the view that criminal behavior is the product of 
mental processes. The psychoanalytical ideas of Sigmund Freud focus on early childhood 
development and on unconscious motivations — that is, motivations of which the offender 
himself is not aware. Freud identified a three-part structure to human personality: the id (the 
drive for food, sex, and other life-sustaining things), the superego (the conscience that 
develops when learned values become incorporated into a person’s behavior), and the ego 
(the “I,” or the product of the interaction between what a person wants and what his 
conscience will allow him to do to achieve what he wants).
