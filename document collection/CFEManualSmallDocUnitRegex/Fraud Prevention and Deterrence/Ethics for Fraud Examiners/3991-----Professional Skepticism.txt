Professional Skepticism  
Fraud examiners must always perform their work with an attitude of skepticism, and begin 
with the belief that something is wrong or someone is committing a fraud (depending, of 
course, on the nature of the assignment and the preliminary information available). This 
attitude may make fraud examinations extensive and expensive. Relaxation of this initial 
attitude of skepticism occurs only when the evidence shows no signs of fraudulent activity. 
At no time is a Certified Fraud Examiner entitled to “assume” a fraud problem does not 
exist. Professional skepticism can be dispelled only by evidence. As a result, opinions or 
attestations about a fraud-free environment are absolutely prohibited for Certified  
Fraud Examiners.
