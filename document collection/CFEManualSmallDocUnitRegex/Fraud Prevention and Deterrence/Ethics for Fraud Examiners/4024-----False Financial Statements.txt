False Financial Statements 
This includes any false statement with regard to a corporation’s financial condition. It means 
something more than merely untrue or erroneous information. It also implies that the 
statement is decidedly untrue and deceitful, and made with the intention to deceive a person 
to whom the false statement is made or exhibited. 
 
Any indication that financial statements are not accurate requires further review to determine 
the reasons for their inaccuracy. While there may be legitimate reasons for the apparent 
inaccuracies, it is incumbent on the Certified Fraud Examiner to review the situation enough 
to determine those reasons and document his inquiry.
