Ethics for Fraud Examiners

Compounding a Felony 
The criminal act of compounding a felony can result from participating in a trade for 
restitution for agreeing to forgo prosecution. While plea bargains might be acceptable under 
the supervision of a court, Certified Fraud Examiners should be very careful and should 
obtain legal advice when negotiating private deals. 
 
Some rules for professionals insert the word “knowingly” in relation to illegal activities, 
saying: “One should not knowingly  be a party to an illegal activity.” The Certified Fraud 
Examiner Code does not include this way out. Certified Fraud Examiners are generally not 
entitled to claim ignorance of the law. They are expected to know a considerable amount 
of law in connection with investigations, and they are expected to know when to consult  
a lawyer.
