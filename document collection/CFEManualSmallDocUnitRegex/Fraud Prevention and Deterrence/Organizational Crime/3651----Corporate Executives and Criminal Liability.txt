Corporate Executives and Criminal Liability 
Many of the ethical and legal problems of a corporation result from the corporate structure 
that separates ownership from management. Typical large corporations are administered by a 
group of salaried managers, with the board of directors exercising little direct power other 
than hiring or firing the managers, and thus corporate managers have great autonomy over 
decisions regarding production, investment, pricing, and marketing. 
 
Luthans and Hodgetts said that after performing a study with the American Management 
Society, 3,000 executives questioned “felt under pressure to compromise personal standards 
to meet company goals,” but that they felt “that business ethics should still be a concern.” 
 
Executives tend to believe that their jobs are at risk if they cannot show a profit to higher 
management or the board of directors, and often they are. Clinard and Yeager hold that if 
goals for managers are set too high, the employee then confronts a hard choice of risking 
being thought incompetent or taking unethical or even illegal shortcuts.

According to Clinard and Yeager, corporations often try to protect their executives from 
liability by agreeing to pay fines, court costs, and attorney’s fees with corporate funds; 
bonuses, raises, or liability insurance might offer protection to officers or directors. 
Generally, executive compensation and tenure remain untouched. There is much difficulty in 
criminal prosecution of executives because corporate violations are usually far more complex 
than conventional crimes. Also, the complexity of the legal proof required allows 
businessmen to test the limits of the law. 
 
Businessmen might have sought legal advice on loopholes in the law before committing the 
offense, Clinard and Yeager say, which may be cited as evidence that the executives thought 
they were in legal compliance. Businessmen can hire highly skilled lawyers who present 
arguments as to the client’s lack of previous convictions or unlikelihood of becoming a 
repeat offender, as well as being able to cite numerous precedents where businessmen were 
charged but not imprisoned for similar violations. 
 
Corporate offenders are usually not imprisoned with ordinary criminals, but are usually 
incarcerated in institutions designed for low-risk inmates with short sentences, presumably 
for the corporate offender’s own physical safety. Justifications used in arguing against a 
prison sentence for corporate offenders include: 
• Age and poor health 
• Personal and family reasons 
• Extent of punishment already suffered by virtue of being indicted 
• Offense was not immoral 
• Defendant has no prior record, is not a threat to society, and has been a prominent 
citizen active in community affairs 
• Incarceration would accomplish nothing (no benefit to society) 
• Defendant is repentant 
• Victimization of corporate executives solely because of their position 
 
Some corporate offenders are given community service as punishment, such as giving 
speeches about their offenses to businesses and civic groups, working in programs  
designed to aid the poor, or helping former ordinary criminal offenders secure job pledges 
from businesses. 
 
Prior to 2001, corporate offenders generally received little, if any, public attention. Coverage 
of corporate scandals was often limited to business and trade publications. However, all of

that changed with the Enron scandal. Suddenly, corporate offenders were front-page news, 
and prosecutors have increased their efforts in pursing corporate executives for wrongdoing 
in the corporate organization.
