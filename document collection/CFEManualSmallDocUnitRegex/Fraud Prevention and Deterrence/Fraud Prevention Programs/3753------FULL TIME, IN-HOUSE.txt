FULL TIME, IN-HOUSE 
A full-time, in-house hotline may be feasible depending on the company size. The advantage 
is that people can make reports at any time, day or night, and talk to a person. The 
disadvantage is cost, and like the part-time line, some people might be reluctant to report 
directly to the company.
