Conflicts of Interest 
There are several situations that could give rise to a conflict of interest. The most common 
are accepting gifts from suppliers, employment by another company, ownership of a 
significant part of another company or business, close or family relationships with outside 
suppliers, and communications with competitors. A potential conflict of interest exists for 
employees who make decisions in their jobs that would allow them to give preference or 
favor to a customer in exchange for anything of personal benefit to themselves or their 
friends and families. 
 
Such situations could interfere with an employee’s ability to make judgments solely in the 
company’s best interest.
