Cooperating Defendants 
Some standard assumptions still apply. For example, informing on one’s cohorts does help. 
Over 42 percent of cooperating defendants were charged with a single violation, while only 
30 percent of uncooperative defendants were so lucky. Also, white-collar defendants receive 
bail rather easily: just one person in eight spends any time incarcerated before trial, and for 
the generally high-status anti-trust defendants, the figure is fewer than one in 20. By 
comparison, in a control group of “common criminals” (i.e., people convicted of the 
“nonviolent economic crimes” of postal theft or postal fraud), at least 1/3 of the defendants 
spent time in jail before going to trial.
