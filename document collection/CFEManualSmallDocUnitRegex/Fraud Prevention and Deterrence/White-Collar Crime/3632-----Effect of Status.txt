Effect of Status 
What is loosely called “class” or “social status” does have an effect on crimes. For example, 
one defendant used his position as chairman of a local bank board to set up loans for his 
ailing wood chip company. The loans would never have been approved without the 
chairman’s influence, and he never reported them in his proxy statement to the bank’s 
shareholders. Ultimately, the bank lost close to $6 million. In this case, the chairman’s class 
standing made a difference. His ruse squares with the documented knowledge that officers 
and managers commit the business crimes with the widest impact (in terms of dollar 
amounts and victimization), while owners and workers generally commit narrower schemes.
