VICTIM’S ANTI-FRAUD CONTROLS AT TIME OF FRAUD 
We asked survey participants which of several common anti-fraud controls were in place at 
the victim organization during the perpetration of the fraud. A distinction should be made 
between the following data and the prior discussion on fraud detection methods. The 
following analysis covers the mere presence of each control — not necessarily its role in 
detecting the fraud once it started. More than three-quarters of the victim organizations in 
our study had their financial statements audited by external auditors, while two-thirds had 
dedicated internal audit or fraud examination departments, and almost 60% had independent 
audits of their internal controls over financial reporting. Additionally, nearly 70% of the 
organizations had a formal code of conduct in place at the time of the fraud, though only 
39% extended that to include a formal anti-fraud policy.

As mentioned in our discussion on fraud detection method, tips are the number one means 
by which fraud is detected. However, less than half of the victim organizations in our study 
had a hotline in place at the time the fraud occurred. There is evidence that the presence of a 
hotline improves organizations’ ability to detect fraud and limit fraud losses, which should 
cause more organizations to implement fraud hotlines.
