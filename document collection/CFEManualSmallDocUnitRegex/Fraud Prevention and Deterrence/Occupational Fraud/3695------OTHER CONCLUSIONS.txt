OTHER CONCLUSIONS 
Hollinger and Clark reached several other conclusions based on their work. First, they found 
that “substantially increasing the internal security presence does not seem to be appropriate, 
given the prevalence of the problem. In fact, doing so may make things worse.” Second, they 
concluded that the same kinds of employees who engage in other workplace deviance are 
also principally the ones who engage in employee theft. They found persuasive evidence that 
slow or sloppy workmanship, sick-leave abuses, long coffee breaks, alcohol and drug use at 
work, and coming in late and/or leaving early were more likely to be present in the 
employee-thief. 
 
Third, the researchers hypothesized that if efforts are made to reduce employee theft 
without reducing its underlying causes (e.g., employee dissatisfaction, lack of ethics), the 
result could create a “hydraulic effect.” That is, tightening controls over property deviance 
may create more detrimental acts affecting the productivity of the organization — if we push 
down employee theft, that action may push up goldbricking. Fourth, they asserted that 
increased management sensitivity to its employees will reduce all forms of workplace 
deviance. Fifth, they concluded special attention should be afforded young employees, as 
these are the ones statistically the most likely to steal. It must be pointed out, however, that 
although the incidence of theft is higher among younger employees, the losses associated 
with those thefts are typically lower than losses caused by more senior employees who have 
greater financial authority. 
 
Hollinger and Clark asserted that management must pay attention to four aspects of policy 
development: (1) a clear understanding regarding theft behavior, (2) continuous 
dissemination of positive information reflective of the company’s policies, (3) enforcement 
of sanctions, and (4) publicizing the sanctions. 
 
The researchers summed up their observations by saying, “perhaps the most important 
overall policy implication that can be drawn … is that theft and workplace deviance are in 
large part a reflection of how management at all levels of the organization is perceived by the 
employee. Specifically, if the employee is permitted to conclude that his contribution to the 
workplace is not appreciated or that the organization does not seem to care about the theft 
of its property, we expect to find greater involvement. In conclusion, a lowered prevalence

of employee theft may be one valuable consequence of a management team that is 
responsive to the current perceptions and attitudes of its workforce.” 42
