OCCUPATIONAL FRAUD 
 
Occupational fraud is committed largely by individuals or small groups of individuals in 
connection with their occupation. It can include violations of law by businessmen, 
politicians, labor union leaders, lawyers, doctors, pharmacists, and employees who embezzle 
money from their employers or steal merchandise and tools.  
 
Gary Green, in honing the white-collar crime concept, uses the term occupational crime,  which 
he defines as “any act punishable by law which is committed through opportunity created in 
the course of an occupation which is legal.” Green further delineates occupational crime into 
four categories: 
• Crimes for the benefit of an employing organization (organizational occupational crime) 
• Crimes by officials through exercise of their state-based authority (state authority 
occupational crime) 
• Crimes by professionals in their capacity as professionals (professional  
occupational crime) 
• Crimes by individuals as individuals  
 
Some scholars debate whether individuals should be held responsible for crimes committed 
on behalf of their organizations. Although some direct benefit accrues to the perpetrator, far 
more benefit accrues to the organization. Regardless of whether the organization is held 
liable, the fraud is a direct result of some human action or interaction. In the words of Parisi, 
“If [an organization] is like a gun, then there must be someone comparable to a triggerman.”
