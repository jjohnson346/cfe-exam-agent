Summaries of Witnesses’ Statements 
Reduce voluminous testimony and witness statements to summary form in order to identify 
inconsistent statements and to permit quick review. To identify pertinent passages, indicate 
briefly the topic being covered at a given point, and provide a synopsis of the statement (see 
example below).

Keep the synopsis as succinct as possible. Too much detail will impair the summary’s utility. 
The examiner or someone familiar with the facts and issues in the case should prepare the 
summary, not an assistant who does not know what might or might not be relevant. The 
summary can also be useful as a basis for a chronology. 
 
Reporting Standards  Investigation
