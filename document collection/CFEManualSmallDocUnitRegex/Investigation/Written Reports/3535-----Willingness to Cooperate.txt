Willingness to Cooperate 
It makes it easier for the confessor when he perceives that the statement includes language 
portraying him in a more favorable light. The confessor can convert that natural tendency by 
emphasizing cooperation and willingness to make amends. 
 
EXAMPLE 
“I am willing to cooperate in hel ping undo what I have done. I promise that I will try to repay 
whatever damages I caused by my actions.”
