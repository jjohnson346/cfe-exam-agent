Misplaced Modifiers 
A modifier (a word, a phrase, or a clause) is misplaced when it modifies, or appears to 
modify, the wrong word or phrase. 
 
CHANGE: I almost located all the missing files. 
 
TO :  I located almost all the missing files. 
 
Possible confusion in sentences of this type can be avoided by placing the modifier 
immediately before the word it is intended to modify. 
 
 CHANGE: All businessmen are not  talented in mathematics. (The implication is that 
no  businessman is talented in mathematics.) 
 
 TO : Not  all businessmen are talented in mathematics.
