Organization of Information 
Because of the amount of information and the number of documents that might be collected 
during a fraud examination, the examiner should plan early and plan well. If circumstances 
permit, an information database should be established in the early phases of the case. Report 
information can be presented either in chronological order or by transaction. The options 
are discussed below.
