Reporting Documents 
The basic reporting documents are: 
• Memoranda 
• Exhibits, documents, or enclosures 
• Indexes 
• Cover page 
• Transmittal letter 
 
The long-form report will consist of copies of these documents. The Linda Reed Collins 
case study report, included in the Appendix to this section, illustrates this approach.  
 
The heart of the documentation is the memorandum of interview, and one memorandum 
should be prepared for each official contact. Once all the memoranda of interviews are 
completed, they are typically assembled in chronological order and indexed.
