The Short Form 
The short-form engagement letter outlines the general scope of the engagement. For 
example, it might describe that the services will include an investigation of a fraud allegation 
received over the hotline, by an anonymous tip, or by an audit anomaly. 
 
The short form might also confirm if the examiner has access to any personnel or 
documentation deemed necessary to carry out the assignment. This type of engagement 
letter is best used for work that will ultimately require an opinion on a fraud allegation. 
Because the examiner will not know the nature of the alleged fraud at the onset, it is best to 
not limit the examination’s scope.
