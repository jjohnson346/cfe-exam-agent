Children’s or Family Trust 
A target might seek to protect assets by transferring them to a children’s or family trust from 
a personal estate. These assets would then be protected from judgment or bankruptcy 
proceedings in a court of law. If the transfer was made to defeat creditors, however, it can be 
set aside by the court.
