PREFIX NUMBERS OF CITIES IN NUMERICAL ORDER 
When the ABA established the city and state prefix numbering system, it did so by the 
geographical location of the reserve cities in existence at the time. The prefix numbers 
identify city and state documents. For example, numbers 1 through 49, as seen in the 
following examples, were given to the most populated reserve cities and major banking 
centers at the time. The rest of the numbers, 50 through 99, were assigned to the states from 
East to West. The principal numbers 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 were given to the main collecting 
financial centers (New York, Pennsylvania, Illi nois, Missouri and California). The numbers 
before and after each principal number were generally designated to nearby states.
