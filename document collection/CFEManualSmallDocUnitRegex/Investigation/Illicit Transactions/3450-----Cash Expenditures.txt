Cash Expenditures 
Cash expenditures consist of the total outlay of funds less net bank disbursements. The total 
outlay of funds includes all payments made by cash or check. There is no need to determine 
which part was paid by cash and which part by check. Total outlays include but are not 
limited to: 
• Purchase of capital assets to investments (determined from settlement sheets, invoices, 
statements, and the like) 
• Loan repayments (determined from loan ledgers of banks or other creditors) 
• Living expenses (can be determined from the same sources presented in the net worth 
and expenditures sections) 
• Purchases, business expenses (less noncash items, such as depreciation), rental expenses, 
and the like

Net bank disbursements can be determined by the following formula: 
 
Net Deposits to All Accounts  
+ Beginning balances 
= Net bank funds available 
– Ending balances 
= Net banking disbursements 
 
Funds from known sources include, but are not limited to salaries, business profits, 
insurance proceeds, gifts received, loans, and inheritances. Funds from known sources are 
subtracted from total receipts (or income) to arrive at funds from unknown or  
illegal sources.
