The Accounting System 
Understanding the basic accounting system and its integration with the operations of the 
business is important. The basic accounting system, including the system of internal 
controls, is the key element in providing evidence of past, present, and future internal fraud. 
Internal fraud that is on-book will appear within the entity’s financial records. The audit trail 
might be obscure, but it will exist nonetheless. If the internal fraud is off-book, then other 
evidence might, with diligent fraud examination techniques, be uncovered. 
 
All internal fraud has an impact on the bottom line. However, fraud in small amounts will be 
harder to detect because of its immaterial amount relative to the financial statements as a 
whole. If an internal fraud scheme is large enough, it will have an effect on the entity’s 
financial statements.
