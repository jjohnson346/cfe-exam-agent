Bank Secrecy Act Documents 
Under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks and other financial institutions are required to file 
Currency Transaction Reports, Suspicious Activity Reports, and other reports detailing large 
cash transactions or suspicious activity. (See the chapter on “Money Laundering” in the 
Financial Transactions section of the Fraud Examiners Manual  for a complete description of 
each report.) These reports will reflect the identity, address, and Social Security number of 
the person making the cash transaction, total amount, and certain other information. Some 
organizations are exempt from the filing requirement, including certain high-volume cash 
businesses, governmental agencies, and payroll account holders.
