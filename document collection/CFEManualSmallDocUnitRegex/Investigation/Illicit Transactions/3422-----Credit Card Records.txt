Credit Card Records 
Banks are increasingly doing business in credit cards. Under bank credit card plans, the 
cardholder can charge purchases at stores, restaurants, and other places that agree to accept 
the charges. Under most plans, the cardholder can elect to pay the entire balance in one 
payment or to pay in installments under arrangements similar to a loan account.  
 
The credit card records that are important to the economic crime investigator are the 
application for a card and the bank’s copies of  monthly statements sent to the cardholder.  
Credit card applications require a considerable amount of financial information, and some of 
the information may be the same as that found on an application for a bank loan. In today’s

environment, credit cards may be tied to bank accounts and may not require a separate 
application.  
 
Credit card statements also contain a great deal of important information. Generally, these 
statements contain the name of the credit card issuer, the cardholder’s account number, a 
summary of the transactions on the account, payment information, and a list of all the 
transactions that occurred during that months billing cycle (i.e., purchases, payments, credits, 
cash advances, and balance transfers).
