Fingerprints on Paper or Other Absorbent Porous Surfaces 
Fraud examiners should never try to develop latent fingerprints that have been absorbed into 
paper or other porous materials by dusting with fingerprint powder or any other means. 
 
Such efforts will not only be unsuccessful, but will prevent additional examinations. Preserve 
the evidence by placing the item into a plastic bag or cellophane protector. Label the 
container with the examiner’s initials, the date, and an identifying exhibit number. Experts 
will use various methods on these materials, including iodine fuming and brushing or 
spraying silver nitrate solution or ninhydrin spray, which reacts with the body chemicals and 
other substances in the latent print that have soaked into the absorbent surface. Some of 
these methods will permanently discolor a document.
