Fingerprints on Hard, Non-Porous Surfaces 
Items with hard, non-porous surfaces, such as plastic, metal, and glass, can be dusted for the 
presence of latent fingerprints left on their surfaces. Special fingerprint dusting powders and 
lifting materials are available from law enforcement suppliers. The dry, powdered toner used 
in some photocopy machines has also been used successfully for fingerprint dusting. 
 
After dusting the surface and locating a suspected print or partial print, blow or gently brush 
off the excess powder. Remove the developed print with adhesive lifting tape and place the 
tape on an index card that contrasts in color with the dusting powder used. Mark the card 
with initials, the date, an identifying exhibit number, and where the print was found.  
 
Some latent prints on non-porous surfaces might not be developed by the dusting method. 
If possible, rather than dusting the item, the fraud examiner should retain it; place it in a 
protective container; initial, date, and label the container with an identifying exhibit number; 
and submit it to a fingerprint expert for processing. Rather than dusting, fingerprint experts 
might use cyanoacrylate (“super-glue”) fuming or a laser to successfully develop and 
photograph the latent prints on some materials, such as black plastic bags.
