Variations  
No one signs his signature or writes exactly the same way twice because writing is a human 
act of coordinated mental and muscular activity, not the precise, repetitive action of a 
machine. However, each writer has his own fairly specific range of natural variation. Several 
examples of writing are necessary for a forensic document examiner to establish if a 
questioned writing is, or is not, within the range of natural variation of a particular writer. If 
fraud examiners find two signatures that are exactly alike, then at least one is a forgery, 
probably a tracing.
