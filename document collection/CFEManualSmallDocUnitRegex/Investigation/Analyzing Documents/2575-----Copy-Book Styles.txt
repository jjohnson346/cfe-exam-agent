Copy-Book Styles  
Some of a writer’s letter shapes, handwritings tyle, and other characteristics might be shared 
by other writers because they were taught the same original copy-book system. In the United 
States, different states and different school districts within the states teach several different 
copy-book systems. Internationally, different systems are also taught. Writers might retain 
remnants of the system they learned as children. As an example, second-language writings of 
people taught in a Cyrillic (Russian) alphabet style will be influenced by Cyrillic letter styles 
and might contain some similarities. As another example, the hand printing and numeral 
styles taught to draftsmen, architects, and engineers might result in apparent similarities in 
the hand printing of people trained in those professions.
