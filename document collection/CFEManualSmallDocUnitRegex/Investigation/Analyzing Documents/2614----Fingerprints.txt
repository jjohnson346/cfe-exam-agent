Fingerprints 
Latent (non-visible) prints are left on surfaces by the body oils, salts, and amino acids 
clinging to or exuded by friction ridges in the skin on fingers, palms of the hands, and soles 
of the feet and are unique personal identifiers. Latent prints might also be deposited on 
surfaces by hands, fingers, and bare feet through the transfer of oils and greases. Patent 
(visible) prints are sometimes deposited on surfaces by hands, fingers, and bare feet through 
the transfer of materials such as blood, paint, soot, and soil. 
  
Latent prints absorbed into protected porous sur faces, such as paper in files or pages in 
books, have been known to survive for decades and still be identifiable after chemical 
development. However, latent fingerprints on hard, non-porous surfaces can be destroyed or 
deteriorate rapidly if handled; not protected fr om the environment; or exposed to high 
temperatures, humidity, or water. 
 
Fraud examiners should wear protective gloves or carefully use tweezers when handling 
latent fingerprint evidence to avoid smudging and contamination. Tweezers should not be 
used on documents if indented writing or photocopier examinations are planned.
