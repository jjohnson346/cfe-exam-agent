Obtaining Dictated Handwriting Samples by Court Order 
When obtaining a legal order for samples, the investigator and/or attorney should ensure 
that the order specifies that the samples should be provided in the writer’s normal 
handwriting and in sufficient quantity, text, and form, at the interviewer’s discretion, to 
permit a determination of identity or non-identity. A court order with these specifications 
will permit an inference of guilt, or might allow pursuit of contempt of court charges if the 
suspect refuses to comply or attempts to prevent identification by intentionally disguising his 
writings, limiting the amount of writings, or failing to follow the interviewer’s instructions 
and dictations.
