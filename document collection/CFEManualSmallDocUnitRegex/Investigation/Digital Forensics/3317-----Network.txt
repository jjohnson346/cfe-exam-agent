Network 
In addition to searching for evidence on the suspect’s operating system and workstation, it is 
also important to examine information stored on company servers. A wealth of information, 
which is separate from a user’s workstation, may be stored on company servers. Data stored 
on company networks may include documents posted to a suspect’s own home directory on 
the network; collaborative work saved to a shared folder or directory; e-mail messages that 
have been sent, received, deleted, or archived; calendars; contact lists; and so on.
