BACKUP TAPES  
Backup tapes are a type of removable media that stores data and can be easily removed from 
a computer system or device. Most computer users archive their activities on backup tapes 
or some other form of external storage devices, and most companies use backup tapes to 
store old data, including e-mail data, that was once stored on their servers.
