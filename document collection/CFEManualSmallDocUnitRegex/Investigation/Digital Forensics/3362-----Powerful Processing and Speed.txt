Powerful Processing and Speed  
• Distributed processing allows the user to leverage up to three additional computers to 
reduce processing time and tackle massive data sets. 
• True multi-processor and multi-threading support that takes advantage of hardware 
advancements.  
• Pre- and post-processing refinement allows users to control how images are processed. 
• An advanced data-carving engine that allows users to carve allocated and unallocated 
data and specify criteria, such as file size, data type and pixel size to reduce the amount 
of irrelevant data carved while increasing overall thoroughness.  
• Optimized dtSearch integration delivers fast indexing and fast search results.
