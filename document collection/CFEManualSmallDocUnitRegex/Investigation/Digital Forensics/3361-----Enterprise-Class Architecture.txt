Enterprise-Class Architecture 
• Supports large, complex datasets.  
• Because the FTK components are compartmentalized, the user will never lose work due 
to a crash (e.g., If the GUI crashes, the workers continue to process data). 
• Provides the ability to back up and archive cases. 
• Every copy of FTK 3 includes a total of four  workers to enable distributed processing  
• It incorporates Lab capabilities, such as the ability to leverage a centralized database 
infrastructure and shared distributed processing farm, as well as collaborative forensic 
analysis, central case/task management and Web review. This is of particular value to law 
enforcement and government computer forensics labs.
