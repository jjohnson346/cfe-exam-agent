Keyword Searches 
Once the collection process is complete, examiners are left with large volumes of digital data 
that may contain relevant or irrelevant information. At this point, the examiner must process 
and filter the digital information to reduce the amount of data (commonly known as data 
culling) that has been collected by performing keyword searches to identify relevant 
information. 
 
Keyword searches involve identifying relevant evidence by searching for words that are 
material to a case (e.g., names, dates, account numbers, etc.). This type of search will 
minimize the amount of time used to complete an analysis, and it will help protect the fraud 
examiner from allegations that his search was overly broad. 
 
Based on the information known about the case, the examiner should establish a list of 
relevant keywords. Because enormous amounts of data will need to be searched in most 
fraud examinations, examiners and investigators should take care in keeping the list as short 
and relevant as possible, and they should avoid common words or words that can be part of 
other words. As a case progresses, there is a strong likelihood that more keywords will be 
identified. Furthermore, search terms can be devised to look for patterns in data.
