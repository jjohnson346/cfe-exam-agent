Security Risk Assessment Tool  
How do hackers bypass an organization’s strongest security measures? Many people use the 
same password to gain access to different programs and networks. This could be one of the 
weakest links in an organization’s security profile. Some password-protected programs are 
easy to crack while others are virtually impossible. But what if the same password is used for 
both programs? By gaining access to the weakest one, fraudsters have gained access to the 
strongest one, without needing to crack both.
