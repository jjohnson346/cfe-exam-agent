Horizontal Ratio Analysis 
Horizontal analysis is a technique for analyzing the percentage change in individual financial 
statement items from one year to the next. The first year in the analysis is considered the 
base year, and the changes to subsequent years are computed as a percentage of the base 
year.  
 
This function determines the trends of a company’s expenses, inventory, and so on. 
Discrepancies in a company’s net profit or a large shift in amount of inventory would 
suggest that something is not right within the company.
