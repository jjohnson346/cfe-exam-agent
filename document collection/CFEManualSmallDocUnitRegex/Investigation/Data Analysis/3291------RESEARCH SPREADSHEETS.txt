RESEARCH SPREADSHEETS 
CaseMap has three research spreadsheets: Authorities, Extracts from Authorities and a 
combination of Authorities and Extracts. The research spreadsheets will organize and 
explore the user’s knowledge about the precedents and statutes relevant to their case, and it 
include links to actual case law using the authorities and extracts. The authorities spreadsheet 
can be used to manage top-level information about precedents, statutes, and other types of 
case research. The extracts spreadsheet can be used to capture details about particular 
sections of interest excerpted from important case law and statutes.
