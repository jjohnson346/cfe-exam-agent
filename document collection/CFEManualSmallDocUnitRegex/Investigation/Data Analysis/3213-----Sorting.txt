Sorting 
To sort means to arrange data in a meaningful order. Sorting is nothing new; most reports 
you read are sorted in some way. With sorted data, you can quickly pick out what is 
important. An investigator can ask a program to sort information using different methods, 
such as alphabetically or numerically. For instance, when searching for a suspected 
fraudster’s name out of thousands in a check disbursement file, the software can quickly sort 
a list of payee names.
