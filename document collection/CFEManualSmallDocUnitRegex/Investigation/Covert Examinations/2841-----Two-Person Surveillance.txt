Two-Person Surveillance 
In the “A-B” surveillance technique, the observer directly behind the target is known as the 
“A” observer. A follows the target, and B follows  A either on the same side or from across 
the street. When both observers operate from the same side of the street, and the subject 
turns a corner, A continues in the original direction and crosses the intersecting street. From 
a vantage point, A signals the correct moves to B. When B is operating across the street and 
the subject turns a corner to the right, B will cross the street behind the subject and take up 
the A position. This move should be prearranged. No signals should be necessary. All visual 
signals should be discreet and consistent with the environment. Should the subject turn to 
the left and cross the street toward B, B should drop back to avoid meeting the subject. B 
should keep A in sight to observe signals indicating his next move.
