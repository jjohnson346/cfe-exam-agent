Participant Informants 
The participant informant is directly involved in gathering preliminary evidence in the 
investigation. The informant in this instance not only supplies an investigation with 
information, but the informant is also involved in setting up a “sting” operation, initiating 
contact with the criminal for arrest purposes. A participant informant is just what the name 
suggests—a participant in the investigation of fraudulent or criminal activity.
