Sources 
In some instances (but not many), the source might want money or other consideration for 
furnishing information. The examiner should not offer any compensation. It is better to 
have the source request it. This is to avoid any allegation of misconduct on the part of the 
examiner for paying for information. Sources have their reasons for informing. It might be 
the sense of importance that comes from being involved or a chance to play “detective.” In 
other cases, the source might have a grudge against the target. Other reasons include a 
feeling of moral responsibility to report information. Perhaps more than any other reason, a 
source will furnish information because he likes and trusts the examiner and wants to help.
