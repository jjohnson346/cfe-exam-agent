CREDIT HEADER SEARCHES 
Credit header searches are among the most powerful locator tools. These searches return 
information from credit reports on individuals. They are a valuable source because almost all 
people have been involved in some credit activity either under their true names or an 
assumed (or known as) name. It is appropriate to keep in mind that for common names, it 
may be necessary to use the Social Security number or date of birth to differentiate the 
subject from other people with the same name. The credit bureau headers offer two search 
mechanisms. First, the examiner can discover a current address, an address history, and 
Social Security number(s) associated with the target by using a past address up to seven years 
old. Second, once the Social Security number is in hand, the headers can be searched for 
matches, because the Social Security number is a national identity number. Although Social 
Security numbers are protected from disclosure by the Privacy Act, it has become practically 
impossible for individuals to avoid disclosing them on public records. 
 
CURRENT OCCUPANT/NEW ADDRESS SEARCHES 
A current occupant/new address search may be used to identify the occupant of an address, 
to confirm occupancy, to uncover a forwarding address, or to develop a list of neighbors 
who may know the suspect’s current whereabouts.
