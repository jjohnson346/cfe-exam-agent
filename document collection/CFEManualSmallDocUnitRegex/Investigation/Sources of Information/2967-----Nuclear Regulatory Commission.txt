Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) maintains applications and licenses of people 
and companies that export nuclear material and equipment from the United States. The 
NRC determines whether proposed exports would be inimical to our defense and security 
and, for certain exports, whether they come under the terms of an agreement that establishes 
the ground rules for nuclear cooperation and trade between the United States and the 
country of destination.
