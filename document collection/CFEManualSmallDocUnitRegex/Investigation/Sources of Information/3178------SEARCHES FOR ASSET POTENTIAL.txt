SEARCHES FOR ASSET POTENTIAL 
• The question of whether it is realistically possible to recover known assets may be 
partially answered by searching bankruptcy filings, tax liens, and tax judgments. 
• Again, the versatility of a UCC filings search is seen through the identification of assets 
that may have been pledged, in whole or in part, to secure a loan. For example, in a case 
where a bank lender has secured a loan through some type of chattel as collateral and has 
sought to perfect its lien on the chattel through a UCC filing at the state level, it can be 
fairly assumed that the debtor has a bank account with the secured party. Thus, a bank 
account asset may be identified as a recoverable asset.   
• Consumer credit reports and business credit reports searches may help develop a clearer 
picture of the target’s potential for asset recovery in terms of credit capacity and 
creditworthiness. Although access to consumer credit reports is restricted by the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), business credit reports are not governed by the FCRA. 
Business credit reports often contain information that is useful in verifying information, 
understanding business relationships, and developing basic financial information about 
an organization.
