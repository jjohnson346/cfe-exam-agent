Bonding Companies 
Bonding companies provide bonding services, including surety bonds, license bonds, permit 
bonds, bid bonds, and so on. To get bonded, an entity will have to submit an application for 
a bond at a bonding company. The application for a bond contains the applicant’s (person or 
firm) financial statement and data. The information contained in a bond application is 
essentially the same information that is required in loan applications (though in greater 
detail).
