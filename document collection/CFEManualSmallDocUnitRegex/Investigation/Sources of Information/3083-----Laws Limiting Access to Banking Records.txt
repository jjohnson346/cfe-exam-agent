Laws Limiting Access to Banking Records 
The primary law protecting the privacy of consumer information held by financial 
institutions is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which was signed into law in 1999. The Act 
required the federal government to adopt regulations requiring financial institutions to 
ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information.  
 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also made it a crime for certain institutions—banks, stock 
brokerage firms, insurance companies, loan companies, credit card issuers, and credit 
bureaus—to obtain, disclose, or provide documents under false pretenses pertaining to a 
customer’s financial information.  
 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act applies not only to people who use false pretenses, but also to 
any third party requesting the information when it is known or should be known that false 
pretenses will be used. But certain parties are exempted from this rule. Exempted parties

include law enforcement agencies and insurance companies conducting related claims 
investigations. It also exempts state-licensed private investigators who are attempting to 
collect delinquent child support. 
 
Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, fraud examiners should be extremely careful about 
obtaining financial information from financial institutions.  
 
In addition to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act (12, U.S.C., 
§§ 3401-3422) also limit access to consumer in formation held by financial institutions. In 
general, the Right to Financial Privacy Act prohibits financial institutions from releasing a 
customer’s financial information to governmental agencies without the customer’s consent, a 
court order, a subpoena, a search warrant, or other formal demand. Thus, if the government 
is requesting information, it must also comply with the Right to Financial Privacy Act. And 
even though the law applies only to demands by governmental agencies, most banks and 
other financial institutions will not release such information to private parties absent legal 
process, such as a subpoena issued in a civil lawsuit.
