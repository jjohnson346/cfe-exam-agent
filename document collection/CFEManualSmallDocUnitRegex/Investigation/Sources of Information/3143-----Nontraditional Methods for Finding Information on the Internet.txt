Nontraditional Methods for Finding Information on the Internet 
Moving beyond the use of Google and other tr aditional methods of searching the Internet is 
important for individuals conducting fraud examinations. This section will examine how to 
use the following websites to obtain information on the Internet: 
• eBay 
• Whois 
• Craigslist 
• Archive 
• Zoominfo  
• GuideStar 
•  NOZA  
 
In addition to the above sites, this section will also discuss how an examiner can find 
valuable information using social networking sites.  
 
The websites addressed in this discussion are tried and true resources that fraud examiners 
should be comfortable with using. But before using these sites, establish an undercover e-mail 
account to use when searching. The e-mail account should be set up through a web-based
service like Hotmail, Yahoo!, or Gmail. Examiners should not use any of the following 
information when creating the e-mail account: 
• Personal names 
• Geographical region 
• Favorite sports teams 
• Hobbies 
 
In addition, a discreet e-mail account should have certain characteristics, such as a gender-neutral 
name. The handle should be comprised of numbers and letters that appear to be for 
a purpose, giving it added credibility and authenticity.
