Investigative Consumer Report 
Under the FCRA, an investigative consumer report is a report containing information about 
an individual’s character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living, that 
is obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, or associates. If such a 
report is made, then other notices and consents may need to be obtained from the 
individual. For example, a separate disclosure must be used to inform the employee that an 
investigative consumer report is being obtained. The form must also state what sort of 
information will be collected. 
 
Also, the company must disclose to the individual the nature and scope of the investigation 
(if he requests). If any adverse action is to be taken against the person, he can ask to receive 
a copy of the report before such action is taken. Further, the report given to the individual 
must not be redacted, meaning that if the report contains names of the people providing the 
information and what they reported, such information cannot be deleted from the report. 
The person must also be given an opportunity to dispute the findings in the report.
