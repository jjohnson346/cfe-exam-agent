Federal Directory 
Carroll Publishing’s Federal Directory combines all three branches of the government into 
one volume. It contains nearly 38,000 names, titles, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses 
of senior- and mid-level governmental officials in the executive office of the president, all 15 
cabinet-level federal departments, independent agencies, U.S. Congress, and the federal court 
system. This directory features a keyword index to help users quickly find program and 
regulatory offices, and it is updated four times a year.
