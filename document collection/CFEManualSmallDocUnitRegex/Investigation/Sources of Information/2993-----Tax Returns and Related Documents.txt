Tax Returns and Related Documents 
Personal tax returns, if available, may provide indirect evidence of illicit payments, such as 
profits or losses from previously undisclosed business ventures, or interest and dividends on 
hidden certificates of deposit and bank accounts. The returns may also show deductions and 
expenses, such as real estate taxes, which may lead to previously unknown funds or assets.
