Right to Financial Privacy Act 
The Right to Financial Privacy Act prohibits financial institutions from disclosing financial 
information about individual customers to governmental agencies without the customer’s 
consent, a court order, a subpoena, a search warrant, or other formal demand. There are, 
however, limited exceptions to this rule. 
 
Although the statute applies only to demands by governmental agencies, most banks and 
other financial institutions also will not release such information to private parties absent 
legal process, such as a subpoena issued in a civil lawsuit.
