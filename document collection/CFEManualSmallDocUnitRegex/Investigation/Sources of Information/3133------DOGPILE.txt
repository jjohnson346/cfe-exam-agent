DOGPILE  
Owned by Infospace, this engine sends a query to a customizable list of search engines, 
directories, and specialty search sites (e.g., Google, Yahoo! Search, Bing, Ask.com) and then 
displays the results from each search engine individually. Once the results are retrieved, the 
innovative meta-search technology used by Dogpile goes to work removing duplicates and 
analyzing the results to help ensure that the best results top the list. The Comparison View 
feature lets users compare results from the leading engines with the click of a button.
