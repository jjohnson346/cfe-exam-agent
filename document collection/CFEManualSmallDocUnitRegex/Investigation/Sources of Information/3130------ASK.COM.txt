ASK.COM  
Formerly AskJeeves, Ask.com is a good site for beginners and for general queries. The 
engine leads users through questions to help narrow the search, and also searches six other 
search sites. (For similar services, see metasearch engines, below.) Ask.com’s ability to 
interpret natural language makes it easy to use, though constructing precise queries can be 
difficult for the same reason.
