YONAME 
Yoname is similar to Spokeo, but it searches  many social networks that Spokeo does not. 
Yoname is a free service, but the results can be random. Spokeo has a better return rate on 
its searches. It is important to note that if an examiner searches by a user’s e-mail address, 
Yoname will send the user an e-mail saying that someone was looking up “yo name” in 
Yoname. Although the e-mail does not contain the searcher’s information, it could be 
enough to alert a suspicious fraudster.
