Workplace Investigations of Fraud and Misconduct 
The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 amended the Fair Credit Reporting 
Act (FCRA) to exempt certain reports involving employee misconduct investigations. 
 
As a result of these amendments, an employer who uses a third party to conduct a workplace 
investigation no longer has to obtain the prior consent of an employee if the investigation 
involves suspected misconduct, violation of laws or regulations, or violation of any 
preexisting policy of the employer. 
 
To qualify for this exception, the report from the third party must not be communicated to 
anyone other than the employer, an agent of the employer, or the government. 
 
But if “adverse action” is taken against the employee based on the results of the 
investigation, the FCRA still requires the employer to provide the employee with a summary 
of the report. “Adverse action” is broadly defined as any employment decision that adversely

affects the employee. The summary must “contain the nature and substance of the 
communication upon which the adverse action is based.” It does not, however, have to 
identify the individuals interviewed or the sources of the information.
