institutions; trade and professional associations; labor unions; interest groups including 
coalitions, public interest groups, governmental agencies; and governmental affairs 
organizations. It contains a section on federal, state, and municipal government that includes 
the governmental-affairs staff for federal agencies; state governments; and leading cities, 
counties, and authorities. Its “Government Affairs Representatives” section lists more than 
1,200 lobbying firms, law firms, and public relations firms. It details the issues that lobbyists
