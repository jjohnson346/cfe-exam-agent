Competing Demands for Time 
The respondent might hesitate to begin an interview because of other time demands. The 
subject does not necessarily place a negative value on being interviewed, but weighs the value 
of being interviewed against doing something else. The successful interviewer must convince 
the respondent that the interview is a good use of time.
