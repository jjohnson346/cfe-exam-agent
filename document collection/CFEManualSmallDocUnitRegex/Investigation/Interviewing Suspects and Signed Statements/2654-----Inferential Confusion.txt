Inferential Confusion 
Inferential confusion denotes confusion and inaccuracies resulting from errors of inference. 
These errors generally fall into two categories: induction or deduction. Induction occurs when 
the respondent is asked to convert concrete experiences into a higher level of generalization. 
Deduction occurs when the respondent is asked to give concrete examples of certain 
categories of experience.
