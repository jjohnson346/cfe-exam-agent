Extrinsic Rewards 
Extrinsic rewards are rewards the interviewee receives that are not directly related to the 
interview experience, and they cause the respondent to see the interview as a means to an 
end. Extrinsic rewards for interviewees can include money, job advancement, and retention 
of privileges. What is irrelevant to the interviewer might not be to the respondent. A 
sensitive interviewer will be able to recognize what extrinsic rewards the respondent receives, 
if any, from being interviewed.
