Opinions 
Avoid making notes regarding your overall opinions or impressions of a witness. Such notes 
can cause you problems with your credibility if they are later produced in court. Be careful 
not to show excitement when taking notes. During interviews of targets and adverse 
witnesses, take notes in a manner that does not indicate the significance of the information; 
that is, never allow note taking to “telegraph” your emotions.
