FINANCIAL PROBLEMS 
Internal criminals, especially executives and upper management, frequently engage in fraud 
to conceal their true financial condition — either  personal or business. Here are examples of 
how to develop a theme involving financial problems as a motive. In the following example, 
E. J. is an executive of a company and is suspected of fraud.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“ E. J., I was astonished to find out some of your investments have taken such a beating. I don’t 
know how you managed to keep everything afloat as  well as you did. You just did this to stay 
alive financially, didn’t you, E. J.?” 
OR 
“ E. J., I have found out what you’ve been paid around here and, frankly, I was surprised. I 
thought it might be a lot more. No wonder you had to get involved in this. You pretty much 
needed to do this to survive, didn’t you?”
