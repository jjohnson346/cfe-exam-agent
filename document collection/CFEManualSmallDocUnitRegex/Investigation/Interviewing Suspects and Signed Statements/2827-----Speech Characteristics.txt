Speech Characteristics 
The investigator can also ask the witness what types of speech characteristics the suspect 
has. Geiselman again suggests asking the witness whether the suspect’s speech reminds the 
witness of anyone else. The interviewer should also determine whether the suspect had any 
specific accent, an awkward or unusual voice, or used any words repeatedly during the event.
