Approach Sensitive Questions Carefully  
Words such as “routine questions” can be used to play down the significance of the inquiry. 
It is important for information-gathering purposes that the interviewer does not react 
excessively to the respondent’s statements. The interviewer should not express shock, 
disgust, or similar emotions during the interview. Following are examples of ways to  
discuss fraud within a company. The questions are posed in a hypothetical way to avoid 
being accusatory. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Part of my job is to prevent and uncover waste, fraud, and abuse. You understand that, don’t 
you?”
