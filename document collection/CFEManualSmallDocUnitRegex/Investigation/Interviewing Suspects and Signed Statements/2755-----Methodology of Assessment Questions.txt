Methodology of Assessment Questions 
Assessment questions should proceed logically from the least to the most sensitive. The 
following questions illustrate the pattern that an interviewer might take in questioning a

witness when he has some reason to believe the respondent, a company employee, has 
knowledge of a suspected fraud. In most examples, the question’s basis is explained before 
the question is asked. The initial questions seek agreement. 
 
The following questions assume the examiner has some reason to believe the respondent, a 
company employee, has knowledge of a suspected fraud. 
 
EXAMPLE  
Interviewer: 
“The company is particularly concerned about fraud and abuse. There are some new laws in 
effect that will cost the company millions if abus es go on and we don’t try to find them. Do you 
know which law I am talking about?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
Most individuals will not know about the laws concerning corporate sentencing 
guidelines, and will, therefore, answer “no.” The purpose of this question is to get the 
respondent to understand the serious nature of fraud and abuse. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Congress recently passed a law last year that can levy fines of more than $200 million against 
companies that don’t try to clean their own houses.  $200 million is a lot of money, so you can 
understand why the company’s concerned, can’t you?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
The majority of people will say “yes” to this question. In the event of a “no” answer, the 
interviewer should explain the issue fully and, thereafter, attempt to get the respondent’s 
agreement. If that agreement is not forthcoming, the interviewer should assess why not. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Of course, they are not talking about a loyal employee who gets in a bind. They’re talking 
more about senior management. Have you ever read in the newspapers  about what kind of 
people engage in company misdeeds?” 
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.245 
EXPLANATION 
Most people read the newspapers and are at least generally familiar with the problem of 
fraud and abuse. Agreement by the respondent is expected to this question. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Most of them aren’t criminals at all. A lot of times, they’re just trying to save their jobs or just 
trying to get by because the company is so cheap that it won’t pay people what they are worth. 
Do you know what I mean?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
Although the honest person and the dishonest person will both probably answer “yes” 
to this question, the honest individual is less likely to accept the premise that these 
people are not wrongdoers. Many honest people might reply, “Yes, I understand, but that 
doesn’t justify stealing.” 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Why do you think someone around here might be justified in taking  company property?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
Because fraud perpetrators frequently justify their acts, the dishonest individual is more 
likely than the honest person to attempt a justification, such as, “Everyone does it,”  or “The 
company should treat people better if they don’t want them to steal.”  The honest person, on the 
other hand, is much more likely to say, “There is no justification for stealing from the company. It 
is dishonest.”  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“How do you think we should deal with someone who got in a bind and did something wrong in 
the eyes of the company?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
Similar to other questions in this series, the ho nest person wants to “throw the book” at the 
miscreant, while the culpable individual typically will say, “How should I know? It’s not up to 
me,” or, “If they were a good employee, maybe we should give them another chance.”

EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Do you think someone in your department might have taken something from the company 
because they thought they were justified?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
Most people — honest or dishonest — will answer “no” to this question. The culpable 
person, however, will more likely say “yes” wi thout elaborating. The honest person, if 
answering “yes,” will most likely provide details. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Have you ever felt yourself—even though you di dn’t go through with it—justified in taking 
advantage of your position?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
Again, most people, both honest and dishonest, will answer this question “no.” The 
dishonest person, however, is more likely to acknowledge having at least “thought” of 
doing it. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Who in your department do you feel would think they were justified in doing something against 
the company?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
The dishonest person will not likely furnish an answer to this question, saying instead 
that, “I guess anyone could have a justification if they wanted to.” The honest individual, on the 
other hand, is more likely to name names—albeit reluctantly. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Do you believe that most people will tell their manager if they believed a colleague was doing 
something wrong, like committin g fraud against the company?” 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.247 
EXPLANATION 
The honest person has more of a sense of integrity, and is much more likely to report a 
misdeed. The dishonest person is more likely to say “no.” When pressed for an 
explanation, this person will typically say, “No, nothing would be done about it, and they 
wouldn’t believe me anyhow.”  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Is there any reason why someone who works with  you would say they thought you might feel 
justified in doing something wrong?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
This is a hypothetical question designed to place the thought in the mind of a wrongdoer 
that someone has named him as a suspect. The honest person will typically say “no.” 
The dishonest person is more likely to try to explain by saying something like, “I know 
there are people around here who don’t like me.”  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“What would concern you most if you did something wrong and it was found out?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
The dishonest person is likely to say something like, “I wouldn’t want to go to jail.” The 
honest person, however, might reject the notion by saying, “I’m not concerned at all, because 
I haven’t done anything.” If the honest person does explain, it will usually be along the lines 
of disappointing friends or family; the di shonest person is more likely to mention 
punitive measures.
