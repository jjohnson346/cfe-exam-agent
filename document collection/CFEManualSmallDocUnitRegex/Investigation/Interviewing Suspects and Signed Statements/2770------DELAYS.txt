DELAYS 
One of the most effective techniques to stop or interrupt the denial is through a delaying 
tactic. The interviewer should not argue with the accused, but rather attempt to delay the 
outright denial. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I hear what you are saying, but let me finish first. Then you can talk.” 
 
The innocent person usually will not “hold on” or let the interviewer continue to develop 
the theme.
