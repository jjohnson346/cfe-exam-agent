Seek Continuous Agreement 
Throughout the interview process — from the introduction to the close — the interviewer 
should attempt to phrase questions so that they can be answered “yes.” It is easier for people 
to reply in the affirmative than the negative. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer : 
“Okay?” 
 
“Can you help me?” 
 
“That’s okay, isn’t it?”
