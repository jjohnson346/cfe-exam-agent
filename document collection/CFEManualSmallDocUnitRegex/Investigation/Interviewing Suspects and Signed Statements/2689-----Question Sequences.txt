Question Sequences 
As a general rule, questioning should proceed from the general to the specific; that is, it is 
best to seek general information before seeking details. A variation is to “reach backward” 
with the questions, by beginning with known information and working toward unknown 
areas. An efficient method of doing this is to recount the known information and then frame 
the next question as a logical continuation of the facts previously related. 
 
It is common, especially in accounting and fraud-related matters, for figures or numbers to 
be critical. Unfortunately, some witnesses are unable to recall specific amounts. The 
interviewer can jog the memory of the respondent by comparing unknown items with items 
of known quantity. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer : 
“Was the amount of money involved more than last year’s figure?”
