Observe Reaction 
When accused of wrongdoing, the typical guilty person will react with silence. If the accused 
does deny culpability, those denials will usually be weak. In some cases, the accused will 
almost mumble the denial. It is common for the culpable individual to avoid outright denials. 
Rather, that person will give reasons why he could not have committed the act in question. 
The innocent person will sometimes react with genuine shock at being accused. It is not at 
all unusual for an innocent person, wrongfully accused, to react with anger. As opposed to 
the guilty person, the innocent person will strongly deny carrying out the act or acts  
in question.
