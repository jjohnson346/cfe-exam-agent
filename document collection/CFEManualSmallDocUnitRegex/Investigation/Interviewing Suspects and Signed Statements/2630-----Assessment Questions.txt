Assessment Questions 
If the interviewer has reason to believe the respondent is being deceptive, he should begin 
asking assessment questions. These are questions specifically designed to establish the 
respondent’s credibility. When assessing credibility, the interviewer must observe the 
subject’s verbal and nonverbal responses. By observing the verbal and nonverbal responses 
of the respondent to these questions, the interviewer can assess the respondent’s credibility 
with some degree of accuracy. That assessment will form the basis of the interviewer’s 
decision about whether to pose admission-seeking questions to obtain a legal admission  
of wrongdoing.
