Free Narratives 
The free narrative is an orderly, continuous account of an event or incident, given with or 
without prompting. It is used to get a quick résumé of what is known about a matter. Be 
sure to designate specifically the occurrence that you wish to discuss. 
 
Sometimes the respondent must be controlled to prevent unnecessary digression. Otherwise, 
use a minimum of interruptions, and do not stop the narrative without good reason. The 
respondent will sometimes provide valuable clues when talking about things that are only 
partially related to the matter under inquiry.
