Expression 
A common function of conversation is self-expression. One or more of the 
conversationalists might need to express ideas, feelings, attitudes, or moods. The illusion of 
an audience is central to a personal expression. The urge for spontaneous expression can be 
a vital asset in interviewing, and it should be encouraged in the respondent. It can be 
directed by the interviewer toward information-gathering objectives, but the interviewer 
should not give way to the urge for personal self-expression. 
 
One of the most common errors made by novice interviewers is to yield to the temptation to 
impress the respondent with their knowledge of the subject of the interview. In doing so, 
interviewers run the risk of making the respondent feel threatened, with the resultant 
tendency for respondents to guard responses rather than express their feelings frankly. 
Experienced interviewers will have the discipline to control their own responses.
