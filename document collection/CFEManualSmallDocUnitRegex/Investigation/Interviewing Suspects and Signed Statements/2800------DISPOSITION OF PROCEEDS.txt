DISPOSITION OF PROCEEDS 
If it has not come out earlier, the interviewer should find out in general what happened to 
any illicit income derived from the misdeeds. It is typical for the money to have been used 
for frivolous or ostentatious purposes. It is important, however, that the confessor sees his 
actions in a more positive light; the interviewer should avoid comments or questions relating 
to “high living.” 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, what happened to the money?” (Let the accused explain; do not suggest an 
answer unless the confessor does not respond.)
