CHANGES IN SPEECH PATTERNS 
Deceptive people often speed up or slow down their speech, or speak louder. There might 
be a change in the voice pitch; as a person becomes tense, the vocal chords constrict. 
Deceptive people also have a tendency to cough or clear their throats during times of 
deception.
