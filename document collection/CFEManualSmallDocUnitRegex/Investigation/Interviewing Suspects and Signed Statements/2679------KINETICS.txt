KINETICS 
Kinetic communication involves the use of body movement to convey meaning. Even though 
posture, hands, and feet all communicate, interviewers tend to focus attention on the face 
and are more accurate in their judgments of others if they can see facial movements and 
expressions. When the interviewer concentrates on facial expressions, the primary interest is 
eye contact. Eye contact primarily communicates the desire to make or avoid 
communication. A person who feels shame normally will drop the eyes to avoid the glance 
of another. This is not only to avoid seeing disapproval, but to conceal personal shame  
and confusion.
