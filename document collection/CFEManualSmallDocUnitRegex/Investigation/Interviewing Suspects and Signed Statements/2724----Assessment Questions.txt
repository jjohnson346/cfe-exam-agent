Assessment Questions 
The closer you get to the admission-seeking interview, the greater chance of facing 
deception. Witnesses might try to cover up what they know, and the target may lie to try to 
convince you that they are not guilty. When you believe the respondent’s answers may be 
deceptive, you should begin asking assessment questions. 
 
Assessment  questions  seek to establish the credibility of the respondent. They are used only 
when the interviewer considers previous statements by the respondent to be inconsistent 
because of possible deception.  
 
Once the respondent has answered all questions  about the event, and the interviewer has 
reason to believe the respondent is being deceptive, a theme must be established to justify 
additional questions. This theme can ordinarily be put forth by saying, “I have a few additional

questions.” Do not indicate in any way that these questions are for a different purpose than 
seeking information.
