Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes


:


Bankruptcy Fraud


:


Typing Services or Petition Mills 
This scheme involves companies that file bankruptcy petitions typically on behalf of low-
 income and often unsuspecting clients. The petitions often contain numerous false 
statements. The debtor usually has no idea a bankruptcy has been filed, as the service has 
held itself out to be a renter’s rights group and has not told the client how it will accomplish 
what it has promised.
