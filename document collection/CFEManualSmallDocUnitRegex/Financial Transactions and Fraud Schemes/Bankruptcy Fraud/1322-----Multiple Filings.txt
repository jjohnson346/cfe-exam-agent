Bankruptcy Fraud

Multiple Filings 
This scheme involves repeated bankruptcy filings by the same debtor in order to obtain the 
benefit of the automatic stay. Usually each petition is dismissed for failure to file the required 
statements or to appear for examination. False statements on petitions are common, 
including a denial that the debtor has filed any previous petition.
