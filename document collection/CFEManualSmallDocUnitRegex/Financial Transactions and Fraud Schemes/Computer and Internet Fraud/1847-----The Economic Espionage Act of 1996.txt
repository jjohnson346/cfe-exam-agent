The Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (Title 18, U.S. Code, Sections 1831-183 9) 
The Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (EEA) makes the theft of trade secrets a federal 
criminal offense. The EEA outlaws two types of trade secret misappropriation: section 1831 
criminalizes economic espionage, which is the theft of a trade secret to benefit a foreign 
government, instrumentality, or agent; and section 1832 criminalizes the theft of commercial 
trade secrets to obtain an economic advantage.  
 
Sections 1831 and 1832 provide significant penalties for trade secret violations. If done to 
benefit a foreign government, the theft of trade secrets is punishable by up to fifteen years 
imprisonment and up to a $500,000 fine. Trade secret theft for commercial benefit is 
punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment and up to a $250,000 fine. The EEA, however, 
does not provide any civil remedies. 
 
Additionally, prosecutors can apply the EEA to a wide variety of misconduct because it 
criminalizes attempts and conspiracies to violate the EEA. The same penalties apply to these 
offenses with increased penalties if the trade secret misappropriation benefits a foreign 
government, foreign instrumentality, or a foreign agent.  
 
Moreover, the EEA authorizes the Attorney General to commence a civil action seeking 
injunctive relief to prevent further disclosure of a trade secret by the defendant or third 
parties.
