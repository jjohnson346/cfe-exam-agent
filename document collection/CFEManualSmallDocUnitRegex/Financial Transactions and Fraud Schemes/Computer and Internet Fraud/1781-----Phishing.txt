Phishing 
Phishing scams are some of the fastest-growing threats on the Internet. According to the 
Gartner research firm, more than 5 million U.S. consumers lost money to phishing attacks in 
the 12 months ending in September 2008, an almost 40 percent increase over the 3.6 million 
who lost money in phishing attacks in the 12 months ending in August 2007. Although the 
number of consumers who lost money to phishing attacks increased in 2008, the average 
customer loss per incident in 2008 was $351, down 60 percent from 2007.  
 
The definition of phishing is to trick people into providing their personal and financial 
information by pretending to be from a legitimate company, agency, or organization. In this 
type of scam, phishers typically use e-mails to direct Internet users to websites that look like 
legitimate e-commerce sites, such as online banks, retailers, or government agencies. 
Phishers actually control these sites and use them to steal sensitive information, such as bank 
account details and passwords. Phishers can also use the phone to hunt for victims’ personal 
information. Some pose as employers and call people who have listed themselves on job 
search websites; others call pretending to be from a company or government agency, making 
the same kinds of false claims and asking for personal information. Phishers may also 
undertake technical subterfuge schemes to plant crimeware onto PCs to steal information 
directly, such as using key-logging systems to intercept customers’ online account user names 
and passwords. 
 
Opinions vary, but the amount of time it takes for an unprotected personal computer to 
become infected with a virus or malware can range from four to thirty-four minutes. To aid

in preventing phishing, computers should be armed with spam filters, anti-virus and anti-
 spyware software, and a firewall, and kept up to date. A spam filter can help reduce the 
number of phishing e-mails received. Anti-virus software, which scans incoming messages 
for troublesome files, and anti-spyware software, which looks for programs that have been 
installed on a computer and tracks a user’s online activities without their knowledge, can 
protect users against pharming and other techniques that phishers use. Firewalls prevent 
hackers and unauthorized communications from entering a user’s computer—which is 
especially important if one has a broadband connection because their computer is open to 
the Internet whenever it’s turned on. Look for programs that offer automatic updates and 
take advantage of free patches that manufacturers offer to fix newly discovered problems. 
 
In order to prevent identity theft through phishing e-mails, computer users should 
completely delete unsolicited e-mails from banks, credit unions, investment firms, and 
government agencies with which they do not have an established relationship. If the 
recipient does have an existing relationship with the supposed originator of the e-mail, the 
Better Business Bureau recommends calling the organization to confirm whether or not the 
e-mail is legitimate before taking any further action. Computer users on the go should be 
wary of entering passwords or sensitive information into a computer that isn’t theirs, such as 
at an Internet café, library, computer lab, or airport kiosk. Wi-Fi networks, either on the road 
or in the consumer’s own home, present even more opportunities for identity thieves. The 
easiest way to protect a Wi-Fi network at home is to not broadcast the Service Set Identifier. 
A safe rule of thumb is to avoid exchanging sensitive information over a Wi-Fi connection 
and wait until a safe network can be accessed.
