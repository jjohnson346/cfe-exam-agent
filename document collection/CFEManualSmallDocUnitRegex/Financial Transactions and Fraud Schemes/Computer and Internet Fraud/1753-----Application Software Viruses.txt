Application Software Viruses 
These types of viruses copy their virus code to a program file and modify the program so the 
virus code gets executed first. The virus does this by writing over the existing code or 
attaching itself to the program file. The more sophisticated types replicate themselves with a 
.com extension each time the user accesses an executable program file. The virus Vienna is a 
type of application virus. It increases infected files by 648 bytes and destroys the system by 
making it reboot when running certain programs.
