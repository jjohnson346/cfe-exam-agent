can be raised in court that the methodology used during analysis could have damaged or 
altered the hardware, media, or data that constitutes the evidence. 
 
Currently, there are no specialized evidence analysis laboratories available to most criminal 
justice agencies to analyze computer, electronic, or magnetic evidence. The U.S. Secret 
Service and the FBI both have such capabilities, but unless the case is of critical importance 
these laboratories process only cases investigated by those agencies.
