Computer-Assisted Crime 
It is sometimes said that most computer fraud is not “computer crime” but involves the use 
of computers instead of other means to break the law. In some cases these traditionally 
illegal acts can yield more loot by recourse to the high speed of the computer. These are in 
reality computer-assisted crimes and the existing criminal statutes can be appropriately 
applied to them. However, where detection and proof problems are exacerbated by the 
involvement of electronic media, computer fraud laws are invaluable for  
effective prosecution.
