Computer Crime 
Computer crime  differs from computer fraud in two major ways. Employees who, as a part of 
their normal duties, have access to the computers are deemed to have authorized access and 
thus do not come under the law against access. Manipulation (alteration) or destruction of 
data (including computer software) is independent of fraudulent or other schemes. Such 
action does not fit into the normal vandalism crimes because the data is intangible.
