Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 (Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1028) 
As discussed in the Consumer Fraud section, the growth of identity theft led Congress to 
pass the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act, which makes identity theft a federal 
crime. This Act outlaws the intentional and unauthorized use of another individual’s 
identification, with the intent to commit a crime. The Identity Theft and Assumption 
Deterrence Act carries a maximum term of 15 years’ imprisonment, a fine, and criminal 
forfeiture of any personal property used or intended to be used to commit the offense. The 
penalty is increased to imprisonment of up to 30 years if the offense is committed to 
facilitate an act of terrorism.
