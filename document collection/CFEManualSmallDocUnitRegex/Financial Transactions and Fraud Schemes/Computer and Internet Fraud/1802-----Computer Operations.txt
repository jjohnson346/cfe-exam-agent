Computer Operations 
Computer operations controls are controls that govern the day-to-day operation of the 
computer system. There should be an approved schedule for all production runs. All system 
activity should be reviewed by data center management. Any unusual program executions 
should be investigated and resolved. A log of unusual events, such as abends  (abnormal 
terminations of a program execution) or reruns should be kept by operations staff and also 
should be reviewed by data center management. Access to the computer room should be 
restricted to authorized personnel. All third parties, such as technicians, should be 
accompanied by a data center employee. Doors to the data center should be secured.
