Altering Checks Prepared by the Fraudster: Blank Checks 
The most egregious example of poor controls in the handling of signed checks is one in 
which the perpetrator prepares a check, leaves the payee designation blank, and submits it to an 
authorized maker who signs the check and returns it to the employee. Obviously, this makes 
it quite easy for the perpetrator to designate himself or an accomplice as the payee. Common 
sense should prevent anyone from giving a signed, blank check to another person. 
Nevertheless, this is a fairly common occurrence, especially when the perpetrator is a trusted 
long-time employee.
