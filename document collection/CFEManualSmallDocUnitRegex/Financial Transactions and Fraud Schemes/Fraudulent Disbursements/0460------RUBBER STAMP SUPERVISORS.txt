“RUBBER STAMP” SUPERVISORS 
The third way to obtain approval of fraudulent timecards is to rely on a supervisor to 
approve them without reviewing their accuracy. The “lazy manager” method seems risky and 
one would think that it would be uncommon, but the truth is that it occurs quite frequently. 
A recurring theme in occupational fraud schemes is the reliance of perpetrators on the 
inattentiveness of others. When an employee sees an opportunity to make a little extra 
money without getting caught, that employee is more likely to be emboldened to attempt a 
fraud scheme. The fact that a supervisor is known to “rubber stamp” timecards or even 
ignore them can be a factor in an employee’s decision to begin stealing from his company.

EXAMPLE 
A temporary employee noticed that his manager did not reconcile the expense journal 
monthly. Thus, the manager did not know ho w much was being paid  to the temporary 
agency. The fraudster completed fictitious time reports, which were sent to the temporary 
agency and which caused the victim company to pay over $30,000 in fraudulent wages. 
Since the fraudster controlled the mail and the manager did not review the expense journal, 
this extremely simple scheme went undetected for some time.
