Statistical Sampling 
As with inventory, the source documentation for purchases can be statistically sampled and 
examined for irregularities. Statistical samples can be drawn to test specific attributes. This 
detection method is particularly effective if a single attribute is suspected, such as fictitious 
vendors. A listing of all post office box addresses might reveal fictitious vendors.
