EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN DELIVERY OF CHECKS 
Obviously, the employees in the best position to intercept signed checks are those whose 
duties include the handling and delivery of signed checks. The most obvious example is a 
mailroom employee who opens outgoing mail containing signed checks and steals the 
checks. Other personnel with access to outgoing checks might include accounts payable 
employees, payroll clerks, and secretaries.
