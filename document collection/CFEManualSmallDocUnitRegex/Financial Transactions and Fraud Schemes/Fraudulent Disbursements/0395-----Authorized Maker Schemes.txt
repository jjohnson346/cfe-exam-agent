Authorized Maker Schemes  
The final check tampering scheme, the authorized maker scheme, may be the most difficult 
to defend against. An authorized maker scheme occurs when an employee with signature 
authority on a company account writes fraudulent checks for his own benefit and signs his 
own name as the maker. (See “Authorized Maker Schemes” flowchart.) The perpetrator in 
these schemes can write and sign fraudulent checks himself. He does not have to alter a pre-
 prepared instrument or forge the maker’s signature.
