Manually Prepared Timecards 
When hours are recorded manually, an employee typically fills out his timecard to reflect the 
number of hours he has worked, then presents it to his supervisor for approval. The 
supervisor verifies the accuracy of the timecard, signs the card to indicate his approval, then 
forwards it to the payroll department so that a paycheck can be issued.  
If an employee fills out his own timecard, it is easy to falsify the number of hours worked. 
He simply writes down false information, showing that he arrived at work earlier or left later

fraudulent card approved by the employee’s supervisor. There are basically three ways for 
the employee to obtain the authorization he needs.
