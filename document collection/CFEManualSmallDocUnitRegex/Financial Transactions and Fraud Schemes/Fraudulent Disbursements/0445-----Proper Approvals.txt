Proper Approvals 
Before adding a vendor to the list, there should be an investigation of the “proposed” 
vendor, performed by someone other than the personnel in purchasing and accounts 
payable. If a vendor number is required before payment is made and the personnel 
responsible for the investigation assigns the vendor that identification number, then the 
buyer cannot place fictitious vendors on the list. Large or unusual purchases should be 
approved by someone independent of the purchasing department.
