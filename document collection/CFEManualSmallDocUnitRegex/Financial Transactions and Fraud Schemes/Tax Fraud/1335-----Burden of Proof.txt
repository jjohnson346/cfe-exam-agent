Burden of Proof  
In July of 1998, President Clinton signed in to law the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act. 
This Act made sweeping changes in the structure and procedures of the IRS. One of the 
most important changes involves the shift of the burden of proof in civil cases. The general 
rule prior to the Act was that the taxpayer bears the burden of proof at trial in civil 
proceedings. The Statutory Notice of Deficiency (90-day letter) enjoyed the presumption of 
correctness. The presumption of correctness in favor of the IRS required the taxpayer to go 
forward with prima facie evidence to disprove the IRS’s determination. After successfully 
rebutting the presumption of correctness, taxpayers had the burden of proving their case by 
at least a preponderance of the evidence.  
 
However the rule established under the Reform Act is that IRS has the burden of proof in 
civil court proceedings on income, gift, estate, or generation-skipping tax liability with 
respect to factual issues that are relevant to determining the taxpayer’s tax liability, provided 
the taxpayer: (1) provides credible evidence on the factual issue; (2) keeps records and backs 
up items as presently required under the Code and regulations; and (3) cooperates with IRS 
in regard to reasonable requests for meetings, interviews, witnesses, information, and 
documents. Corporations, trusts, and partnerships with a net worth in excess of $7 million 
continue to bear the burden of proof. The Senate Finance Committee Report states that if

the taxpayer’s evidence and the IRS’s evidence are equally balanced, the court should find 
that the IRS has not sustained its burden of proof.
