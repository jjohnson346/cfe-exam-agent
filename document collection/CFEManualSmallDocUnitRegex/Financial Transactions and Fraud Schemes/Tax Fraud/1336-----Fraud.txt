Fraud 
Even under the old IRS Code, there was no presumption of correctness afforded the IRS 
when fraud was involved. Therefore, the IRS had the burden of proving fraud [ Armstrong v. 
U.S., 354 F.2d 274; 173 Ct.Cl. 944 (1965)]. If the fraud claim is for more than one year, the 
IRS must show that some part of the underpayment was due to fraud for each year that the 
penalty is added [Professional Services v. Commissioner, 79 TC 888 (1982)]. First, there must be a 
deficiency and second, the deficiency must be substantial [U.S. v. Morse, 491 F.2d 149 (1st Cir 
1974)]. Substantiality  is a question of fact [U.S. v. Marks, 282 F. Supp. 546 (D Or 1966), aff’d  
391 F.2d 210; (9th Cir 1968); cert denied 39 3 U.S. 839 (1968)]. There is controversy about 
whether substantiality applies to the unpaid tax or to unreported income. Fraud penalties 
survive the death of the taxpayer.
