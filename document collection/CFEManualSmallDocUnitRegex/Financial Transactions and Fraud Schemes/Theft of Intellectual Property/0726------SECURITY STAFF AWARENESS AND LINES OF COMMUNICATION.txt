SECURITY STAFF AWARENESS AND LINES OF COMMUNICATION 
The organization’s security force should have training in protecting proprietary information. 
If something out of the ordinary happens, do they have a means of communicating those 
incidents to management? Is an intelligence collection strategy in place? Will patrol officers 
lock up sensitive documents they find unsecured and make out a report detailing the security 
oversight? Do they know how to check for spy drops? Are they taught to observe suspicious 
activity such as an employee who always works late?
