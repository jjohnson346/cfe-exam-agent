Market Research Scams 
In a market research scam, the spy contacts companies by telephone posing as a 
representative of a well-known market research company. The spy uses a phony 
questionnaire designed to obtain background data to assist in further penetration of the 
company. The spy might, in some cases, attempt to obtain direct intelligence data during the 
telephone interview. The spy frequently offers the employee a bogus reward of some kind in 
return for responding to the questionnaire. These calls tend to aim at lower level workers 
who have operational knowledge of the business, but who are not likely to be as defensive as 
higher level managers.
