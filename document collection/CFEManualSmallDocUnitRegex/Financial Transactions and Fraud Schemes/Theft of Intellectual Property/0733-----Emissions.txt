Emissions 
If the heightened activity during a crisis period will result in additional smoke or steam 
emissions, the change should be made as gradually as possible. The key is to avoid creating 
an unusual pattern of activity. Management should ease the company into any critical period 
of operations to avoid drawing the attention of the outside world. Similarly, it should ease 
out of the critical period when it is over.
