Research and Development 
One would think that research and development (R&D) would be the most heavily guarded 
department in a company, but access to R&D information is surprisingly easy. R&D 
personnel are almost always in the flow of information. The open exchange of information 
is part of the nature of their job. They participate in conferences, attend trade shows, and 
work with academic institutions; however, at each of these functions, they leave themselves 
open for intelligence spies to listen, mingle, and ask questions.  
 
Researchers who publish their findings in industry journals may inadvertently include details 
of a project on which they may be working. This is particularly true in the case of academic 
professionals who may be hired by a company to perform research or conduct a study. More 
than one company has been surprised to learn that the results of a supposedly confidential 
study were published in an academic journal. If an academician is hired to conduct research, 
make sure that he understands that the results are to be kept confidential. Also make sure 
that the use of teaching assistants or graduate students is kept to a minimum and that those 
individuals understand the confidentiality requirements.
