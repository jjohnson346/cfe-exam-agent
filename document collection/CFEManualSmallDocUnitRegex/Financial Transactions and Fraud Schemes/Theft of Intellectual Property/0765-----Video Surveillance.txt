microcameras can track activity on production lines or presentations in meeting rooms. They 
can also capture executives or key employees at embarrassing moments. Such 
documentation can later be used for blackmail. 
 
Video cameras with a time and date stamp on the footage offer a means of determining the 
security activity in the company. Times of security patrols, access to special areas like labs, 
the emptying of security wastebaskets, and other activities can all be tracked. This 
information can aid a spy in penetrating restricted or sensitive areas.
