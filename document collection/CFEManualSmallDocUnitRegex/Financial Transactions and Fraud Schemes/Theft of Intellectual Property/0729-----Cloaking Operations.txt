Cloaking Operations   
With good intelligence to identify probable channels for information thieves, a security 
manager can commence the cloaking of sensitive operations. Fluctuations in traffic offer 
industrial spies the best indirect insight into a business. Changes in the rates, deliveries, 
shipments, emissions, and the types and amounts of trash can reveal a great deal. 
 
The cost to mask these fluctuations may be significant at times. Appropriate guidance from 
senior management must be a factor in computing the cost-benefit trade-off. If the risks to a 
product line outweigh the security costs, the security staff should begin a cloaking program.
