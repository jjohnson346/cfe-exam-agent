The Systems Administrator  
In this scheme, an information thief contacts a computer user in an organization and claims 
to be an IT employee of the company. He tells the user that a “network problem” has been 
identified with the user’s computer. The spy asks for the password the user logged on with 
so he can fix the problem. Most employees are willing to give their password out to a 
systems administrator when requested, making this technique very effective. In a similar 
scheme, the spy will pass out a memo on customer letterhead asking users to verify their log-
 on information for “security reasons.”
