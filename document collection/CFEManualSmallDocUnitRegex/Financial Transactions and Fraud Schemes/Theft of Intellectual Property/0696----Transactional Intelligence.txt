Transactional Intelligence 
Just about any mundane business transaction can offer a potential information payoff to a 
spy. Frequent flyer miles document where an executive has traveled. Credit card receipts 
record a trip’s itinerary and goods or services purchased. Even videos purchased or rented at 
a video store are useful for documenting a targeted employee’s tastes and proclivities. Any 
one piece of information by itself has minimal value. Properly compiled, however, this 
information can provide an extensive profile on a target.
