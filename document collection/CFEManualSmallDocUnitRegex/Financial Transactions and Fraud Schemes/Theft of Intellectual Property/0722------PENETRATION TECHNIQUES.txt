PENETRATION TECHNIQUES 
The person performing the security survey should use penetration techniques at various 
times of the day to determine when the company has the greatest degree of vulnerability. Are 
they able to easily walk into the plant on the third shift? Are vendors allowed to wander 
about the facility unescorted? Can a visitor or employee walk unchallenged out of the facility 
past guard stations carrying sensitive documents, computer disks, or a portable computer? 
Are cleaning personnel properly supervised when on-site?
