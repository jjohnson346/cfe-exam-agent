Loading Docks 
Despite the fact that many companies maintain video cameras and security guard patrols at 
their loading docks, these can still be great places to gather intelligence and to slip sensitive 
information out the door. The security personnel at the loading docks are frequently 
contract workers with minimal training on how to spot a sophisticated infiltrator. 
Furthermore, contract security personnel may not be familiar with managers and employees 
from other departments. A spy can sometimes don a badge and a clipboard and move about 
the loading docks with impunity, unquestioned by the security officers who assume he is 
supposed to be there. Meanwhile, the spy is copying down purchase order numbers, address 
label data, and types of merchandise being shipped and received.  
 
Security guards may be trained to prevent the removal of manuals, documents, or software 
that are labeled or color-coded as “confidential.” However, spies can easily change labels and 
covers to a different color. Security officers generally do not have the training to look for 
other indicators of sensitive materials that are being removed.
