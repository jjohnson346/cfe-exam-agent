THEFT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 
Futurist Alvin Toffler identified information as the highest value commodity for the new 
millennium. He speculated that multinational corporate security departments might evolve 
into private armies to protect their company’s assets where host countries cannot. 
 
The world has indeed become a more complex and competitive place. Individual corporate 
organizations have become more powerful than some entire nations and the balance of 
economic power has shifted to the corporation, within which ideas and information have 
become the most highly prized assets — indeed, with more value than a company’s products 
or physical assets.  
 
To a considerable degree, businesses, administrations, and society as a whole have come to 
depend on the efficiency and security of information technology, resulting in information 
acquiring a new and distinct value that cannot be protected in the same way as  
tangible objects.  
 
Information exists in many forms, and its security is achieved by implementing a process of 
risk assessment and commensurate controls to ensure the preservation of: 
• Confidentiality, ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have 
access, and that they can only use it for specified purposes; 
• Integrity, safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing 
methods; and 
• A vailability, ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated 
assets when required. 
 
Intellectual property is a catch-all phrase. It is used here to denote knowledge-based assets 
and capital, including information but extending to ideas, designs, and innovations 
howsoever expressed or recorded. 
 
This chapter addresses the broad issues relating to the vulnerability and criticality of 
information and other intangible property. It advocates a mix of procedural, logical, and 
physical protective measures to combat threats posed by opponents who make it their 
business to try to obtain an advantage by illegally or unethically abusing intellectual property 
belonging to another.
