COMPUTERS 
Always check the back of computers for monitoring devices taped to the back panel. 
Examine all connections between the computer and the outside world: lines to printers, 
network cables, lines to peripheral devices, or lines to monitors. Pay attention to any 
connectors that have been placed between the computer and its external lines. These 
connectors may look like they perform a legitimate function, but if the external line could 
have been plugged directly into the computer, find out why the interface was inserted and 
who put it there. 
 
The area immediately around the computer should be checked for unusual wiring, electronic 
boxes, or devices. Any closets or rooms dedicated to housing network equipment such as 
hubs, routers, cabling rigs, or network monitoring gear needs close examination by a 
qualified network technician to make sure no alien electronic devices are present.
