Signature Panel 
Signature panels usually contain images of the issuer’s logo. Blank or damaged signature 
panels are red flags of forged credit cards. Signatures on the panel and the sales receipt 
should always be compared for consistency. While it may be most merchants’ policy that 
employees compare these signatures, it is often ignored.
