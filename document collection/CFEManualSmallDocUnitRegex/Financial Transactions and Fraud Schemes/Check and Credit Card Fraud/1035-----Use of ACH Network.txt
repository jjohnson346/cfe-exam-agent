Use of ACH Network 
When non-customers of the bank are able to attain access to information about an actual 
customer, fraud may occur. To limit this possibility, banks should perform strict user 
authentication standards. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) requires 
banks within its jurisdiction to uphold a commercially reasonable method to authenticate the 
identity of a customer. Banks that use the ACH are also subject to National Automated 
Clearing House Association (NACHA) rules that require originating banks to take certain 
measures to ensure that the correct customer has authorized the transaction. 
 
NACHA has implemented specific rules for Internet-initiated entries. A specific standard 
entry class (SEC) code must be used for Internet-initiated entries. That code, WEB, must be 
used to identify an ACH debit entry to a consumer account that a receiver authorizes 
through the Internet. The rules apply to both single-entry and recurring debits and require 
ODFIs that transmit WEB entries to warrant that their originators have complied with 
certain standards that protect the security of the ACH network and consumer financial 
information. 
Originators of WEB entries are required to: 
• Obtain consumer authorization prior to initiating a WEB entry. The authorization must 
provide evidence of the consumer’s identity and asset to the authorization. 
• Employ commercially reasonable fraudulent transaction detection systems to screen

entries in order to maintain the risk of fraud. Different transactions may require different 
levels of authentication, depending on the risk level of the transaction. 
• Use commercially reasonable fraudulent transaction detection systems to screen entries 
in order to minimize the risk of fraud. Different transactions may require different levels 
of authentication, depending on the risk level of the transaction. 
• Establish a secure Internet session with each customer using a commercially reasonable 
security technology. That session must be in place from the time consumers enter their 
banking information through the time of the transmission to the originator, including 
any transmission to a service provider such as an aggregator. 
• Conduct an annual security audit to ensure that financial information obtained from 
consumers is protected by security practices and procedures that include adequate levels 
of (1) physical security to protect against theft, tampering, or damage; (2) personnel and 
access controls to protect against unauthorized access and use; and (3) network security 
to ensure capture, storage, and distribution of financial information.
