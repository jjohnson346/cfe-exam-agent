Credit Card Fraud 
Credit card fraud is the misuse of a credit card to make purchases without authorization, or 
counterfeiting a credit card. The use of credit cards as a form of payment has grown 
dramatically over the past decades, with more than 80 percent of U.S. households having at 
least one credit card. As the industry continues to expand and offer credit to more and more 
consumers, fraud will also grow. 
 
Credit card fraud is successful because the chances of being caught are small and 
prosecution is not assured. Retail stores have identified credit card thieves and contacted law 
enforcement only to be turned down for action.
