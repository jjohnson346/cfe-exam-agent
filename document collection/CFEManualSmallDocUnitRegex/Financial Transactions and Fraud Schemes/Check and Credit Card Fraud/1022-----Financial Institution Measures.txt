information, comparing ID information, addresses, and credit reports for accuracy.  
• PIN activation — Bank customers are often required to provide personal identification 
numbers in order to activate their cards over the phone. Callers who are not able to 
provide the PIN number may have manufactured or stolen the card in question.  
• Caller ID — Most people calling to activate their card will do so from home. If the 
number on Caller ID does not match any of the telephone numbers listed in the 
customer’s account information bank personnel should ask some identifying questions.  
• CVV2/CVC2 — Implement these systems as soon as possible. They are among the best 
defenses financial institutions have against credit card fraud.
