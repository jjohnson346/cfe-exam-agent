Check Fraud Vulnerabilities 
A particular institution may be targeted for check frauds because of its location, inadequate 
internal controls, or marketing strategies that present opportunities to savvy check fraud 
artists. Some mutual funds companies, for example, regularly allow customers to open 
accounts by mail, a form of communication with many security vulnerabilities. A significant 
number of check fraud complaints from a particular geographic area may indicate the 
presence of an active, organized group, which warrants law enforcement attention. 
 
Investigators assigned to a region or institution should keep regular contact with businesses 
and regulators. Specific inquiries aim to identify weaknesses, develop controls, and prevent 
future losses. Analyzing the complaints filed by other victims of check fraud — including

retail operations, check cashing establishments and food stores—may reveal common 
elements of schemes that might not otherwise seem related.
