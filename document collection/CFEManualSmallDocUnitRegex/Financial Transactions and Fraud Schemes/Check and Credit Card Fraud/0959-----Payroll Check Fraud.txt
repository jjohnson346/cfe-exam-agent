Payroll Check Fraud 
Check procurers employed by payroll check processing companies print duplicate payroll 
checks that are sold to third parties or are cashed by members of the procurer’s organization. 
To avoid the security employed by financial institutions, the checks are cashed at grocery 
stores and check-cashing operations with loose controls. The checks are usually written for 
amounts of $300 or less to avoid suspicion. Of course, check procurers have access to 
personal information on the legitimate recipients of the payroll checks and make use of it in 
the future.
