Electronic Bill Payment and Person-to-Person Payments 
Increasingly, consumers are using electronic funds transfers, rather than actual currency or 
paper, to pay bills or make online purchases. Through online services offered by many 
financial institutions, an individual can make banking transactions using a system called 
electronic bill payment and presentment, or EBPP. Individuals can pay each other for goods or 
services through this same electronic form, which is known as the person-to-person, or P2P, 
system.  
 
Although these systems are still young, some experts suggest that they will play an important 
part in the way payments are made, according to the Sheshunoff and A.S. Pratt’s publication,

“Electronic Fund Transfer Fraud Protection: Identity Theft to Wire Transfer Fraud.” There 
is relatively low processing and customer service costs for billers, while customers can 
reduce time and costs in making payments. With some EBPP systems, some customers may 
even be able to manage their funds more effectively. Electronic bill payment has received 
faster acceptance than bill presentment, though acceptance appears to be dependent on the 
prices of these services. As the EBPP method of payment continues to increase, it is 
important to be prepared to combat fraud that may surface in this area.
