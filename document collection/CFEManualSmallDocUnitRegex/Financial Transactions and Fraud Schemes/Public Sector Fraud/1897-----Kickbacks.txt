Kickbacks 
 
EXAMPLE 
The former billing clerk and 14 former patients of a Georgia chiropractor were sentenced in 
a kickback scheme costing Medicare and more than 30 insurance companies millions of 
dollars. All were incarcerated and ordered to pay fines and restitution. The chiropractor 
and his office manager wife had paid employees 10 percent of each week’s revenues, and 
patients 33 percent of whatever  the carriers paid on their claims. Claims were submitted for 
patients and their families regardless of whether they were treated. In one instance, bills 
were submitted for 169 persons supposedly trea ted in one day. More than 40 persons have 
been sentenced thus far, including the chiropractor and his wife, who earlier received lengthy 
jail sentences and were ordered to pay $2.2 million in restitution.
