Audit Risk 
7.05  Audit risk is the possibility that the auditors’ findings, conclusions, 
recommendations, or assurance may be improper or incomplete, as a result of 
factors such as evidence that is not sufficient and/or appropriate, an inadequate audit 
process, or intentional omissions or misleading information due to misrepresentation 
or fraud. The assessment of audit risk involves both qualitative and quantitative 
considerations. Factors such as the time frames, complexity, or sensitivity of the 
work; size of the program in terms of dollar amounts and number of citizens served; 
adequacy of the audited entity’s systems and processes to detect inconsistencies, 
significant errors, or fraud; and auditors’ access to records, also impact audit risk. 
Audit risk includes the risk that auditors will not detect a mistake, inconsistency, 
significant error, or fraud in the evidence supporting the audit. Audit risk can be 
reduced by taking actions such as increasing the scope of work; adding experts, 
additional reviewers, and other resources to the audit team; changing the 
methodology to obtain additional evidence, higher quality evidence, or alternative 
forms of corroborating evidence; or aligning the findings and conclusions to reflect 
the evidence obtained.
