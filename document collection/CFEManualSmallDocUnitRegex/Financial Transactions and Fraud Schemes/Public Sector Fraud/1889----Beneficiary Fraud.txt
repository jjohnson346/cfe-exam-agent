Beneficiary Fraud 
Beneficiary frauds tend to be perpetrated by individuals, without collusion or bribery. The 
motive for this type of fraud is personal gain (or reduction of loss) by the perpetrator. 
 
An example of this type of fraud might include a taxpayer who claims an unearned tax credit 
on his federal income tax return. This person has perpetrated a fraud against the 
government. 
 
Some reported cases typifying these frauds are: 
• Social Security frauds 
• False claims for benefits 
• Supplemental Security Income (SSI) fraud 
• Fraudulent Social Security numbers 
• Improper billing procedures 
• False Medicare claims 
• Kickbacks
