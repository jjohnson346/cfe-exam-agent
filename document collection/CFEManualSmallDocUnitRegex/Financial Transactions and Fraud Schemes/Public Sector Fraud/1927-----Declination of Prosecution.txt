Declination of Prosecution 
If the interviewee declines to cooperate voluntarily, the interviewer must make an election. If 
he absolutely needs the statement of the official to ascertain what occurred, he must forego 
any use of the statement (or of any evidence derived from the statement) in a subsequent 
criminal prosecution. In fact, the interviewer must secure a declination of prosecution from a 
prosecutor and thus eliminate the Fifth Amendment problem. (The United States courts and 
most state courts only confer immunity to an official who must cooperate pursuant to an 
agency’s regulations, although at least one state’s supreme court has mandated transactional 
immunity.) In any event, a heavy burden is imposed on the government to show that its 
subsequent criminal case was not tainted by the compelled statement, and a decision to 
compel an interview will ordinarily preclude the option of criminal prosecution.

To ensure that the interviewee has been advised of his obligation to cooperate in a declined 
criminal case, the “Kalkines” warning must be given immediately following the above-
 mentioned administrative warning:  
 
You are further advised that the answers you give to questions pertaining to the matter 
presently under investigation or any information or evidence that is gained by reason of your 
answers, cannot and will not be used against you in any subsequent criminal proceedings, 
except that you may be subject to criminal prosecution for any false answer that you give to 
any questions. Do you understand this? 
 
Failure to comply with this elaborate and complex array of warning requirements can, and 
unfortunately often does, ruin otherwise well-run investigations of senior officials. Two 
additional cases worth reading are Kalkines v. United States, 473 F.2d 1391 (CtCl, 1973) and 
Weston v. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 724 F.2d 943 (CAFC, 1983). A final key 
point to remember is that a failure to give a proper warning by any interviewer, with or 
without official authority to bind the government, will in fact do so.
