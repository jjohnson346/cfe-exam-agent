Government Fraud Auditing Standards 
Standards for audits of government organizations, programs, activities, and functions, and of 
government assistance received by contractors, non-profit organizations, and other non-
 government organizations have been developed by the Comptroller General of the United 
States, Government Accountability Office (GAO). These standards are by and large taken 
from generally accepted auditing standards as established by the AICPA. However, 
Government Auditing Standards, also known as the Yellow Book, go beyond the AICPA 
standards. Generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS) are required to be 
followed by auditors and audit organizations when mandated by law, regulation, agreement, 
contract, or policy. These standards include the following classifications: 
• General standards 
• Fieldwork standards for financial audits 
• Reporting standards for financial audits 
• Field work standards for performance audits 
• Reporting standards for performance audits 
 
(The Yellow Book also provides separate general, field work, and reporting standards for 
attestation engagements. However, the following discussion will focus on those standards 
applicable to financial and performance auditing engagements.) 
 
General standards apply to both financial and performance audits and relate to: 
• Independence of the audit organization and its individual auditors. 
• Use of professional judgment in the performance of work and the preparation of related 
reports. 
• Competence of the audit staff. 
• Audit quality control and assurance. 
• External peer reviews. 
 
Financial audits provide an independent assessment as to whether financial statements are 
presented fairly in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or other 
recognized criteria. Other objectives of financial audits, which provide for different levels of 
assurance and entail various scopes of work, may include:

• Reporting on internal control, compliance with laws and regulations, and provisions of 
contracts and grant agreements as they relate to financial transactions, systems, and 
processes; 
• Providing special reports for specified elements, accounts, or items of a financial 
statement; 
• Reviewing interim financial information; 
• Issuing letters for underwriters and certain other requesting parties; 
• Reporting on the controls over the processing of transactions by service organizations; 
and 
• Auditing compliance with regulations relating to federal award expenditures and other 
governmental financial assistance in conjunction with or as a by-product of a financial 
statement audit. 
 
Performance audits provide assurance or conclusions on certain audit objectives based on 
evaluation against objective criteria, such as specific requirements, measures, or defined 
business practices. Performance audits include engagements related to assessing program 
economy, efficiency, and effectiveness; inter nal controls; compliance; and prospective 
analyses.  
 
The following are the GAO Standards or portions thereof that relate to the government 
auditor’s responsibilities pertaining to fraud. (The standards included in the following section 
reflect the version of the standards adopted by the GAO in of July, 2007.)
