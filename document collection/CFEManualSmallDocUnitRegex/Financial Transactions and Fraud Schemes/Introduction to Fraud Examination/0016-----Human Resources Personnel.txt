Human Resources Personnel 
The human resources department should be consulted to ensure that the laws governing the 
rights of employees in the workplace are not violated. Such involvement will lessen the 
possibility of a wrongful discharge suit or other civil action by the employee. Advice from a 
human resources specialist might also be needed. Normally this person would not directly 
participate in the investigation.
