Fraud Is Hidden 
Unlike other offenses, part of the method of fraud is to conceal its existence. A bank robber 
uses threats or force, while a bank embezzler not only steals money, but also covers up the 
theft. As a result, no opinion should be given to any person that fraud does or does not exist within a 
specific environment. The methods for concealing fraud are so numerous and sometimes 
ingenious that almost anyone — even the examiner — might be defrauded. Offering opinions 
might leave the examiner personally vulnerable to legal problems.
