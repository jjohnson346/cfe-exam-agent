Introduction to Fraud Examination


:


Existence of Fraud 
The existence of fraud is solely the purview of the courts and juries. The examiner must not 
express opinions on the guilt or innocence of any person or party. In resolving fraud issues, the 
examiner must postulate a theory — guilt or innocence — in order to attempt to prove that 
theory. Any discussion of guilt or innocence is only a part of that theory; the examiner must 
not make statements that could be construed to be conclusive in regard to the theory.
