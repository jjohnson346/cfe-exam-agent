Purpose of the Fraud Examination 
The purpose of the fraud examination is to prove or disprove the legal elements of the 
offense. Each and every element must be proven (1) beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal 
cases, and (2) by a preponderance of the evidence in civil cases. To do this, it is necessary to 
understand certain objectives common to white-collar cases. Because investigations of fraud 
often involve an extensive array of information, the fraud examiner can lose sight of the 
objectives. According to Herbert Edelhertz: 
 
One of the characteristics that most distinguishes the investigation of white-collar crime from that 
of common crimes is the necessity  for the investigator to establish the intent and underlying 
motives of the subject by placing together jigsaw puzzle pieces of apparently legitimate activities 
to add up to a picture of illegitimacy — rather than by a simple showing of one event which by 
itself flatly demonstrates wrongful intent.
