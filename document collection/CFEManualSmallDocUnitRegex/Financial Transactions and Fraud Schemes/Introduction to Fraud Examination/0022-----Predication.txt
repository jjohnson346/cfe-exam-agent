Introduction to Fraud Examination

Predication 
Investigation of fraud consists of the multitude of steps necessary to resolve allegations of 
fraud — interviewing witnesses, assembling evidence, writing reports, and dealing with 
prosecutors and the courts. The investigation of fraud, because it deals with the individual 
rights of others, must be conducted only with adequate cause or predication. 
 
Predication is the totality of circumstances that would lead a reasonable, professionally trained, 
and prudent individual to believe a fraud has occurred, is occurring, and/or will occur. 
Predication is the basis upon which an examination is commenced. Fraud examinations 
should not be conducted without proper predication.
