Direct Debit from Checking Accounts     
When a customer decides to purchase an item (from a catalog or over the phone), he is told 
he can purchase it rapidly and simply by giving his bank’s name and his checking account 
number for a direct debit from his account. This results in unauthorized withdrawals from 
the account.
