Consumer Fraud

Buyers Clubs 
This scheme involves membership in discount buying clubs that consumers never agreed to 
join or were signed up for through free-trial offers. Consumers should beware of 
advertisements for products at incredibly cheap prices or free if the consumer pays for 
shipping, these offers may be designed to lure the consumer into a buyer’s club membership. 
Another way to avoid being a victim of a buyer’s club scheme is to understand how a “trial-
 offer” works. In many cases, the consumer will automatically be charged for a membership 
when the free-trial expires unless they contact the club to cancel. The consumer should  
ask for the details of all membership offers in writing before they agree to join. If 
unauthorized charges or debits are noticed on monthly statements, the consumer should 
contact their credit card issuer or bank and ask for their account to be credited for these 
unauthorized charges.
