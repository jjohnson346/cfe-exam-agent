Pigeon Drop   
This is often used on middle-aged or elderly women who are likely to have a savings 
account. Pretending to find a wallet full of money, the con men convince their mark that 
they should divide the “discovered” money. As a show of good faith, each should withdraw 
a sum of money from their bank and turn it over to a lawyer or another third-party for 
safekeeping. They agree to place an ad in a newspaper for the lost wallet. If it is not claimed 
within a certain amount of time, they will split the money. Of course, when the designated 
time expires, the victim will find that the lawyer was part of the scam and that her money has 
vanished.
