Using an Accomplice Within the Organization  
Sometimes the identity thief is able to compromise someone within an organization and 
obtain enough information where credit can be obtained. It may be a bank employee who 
has access to Social Security numbers and bank balances or an insurance clerk who has 
access to personal information such as name, address, Social Security numbers, and medical 
information — all useful when assuming someone’s identity.
