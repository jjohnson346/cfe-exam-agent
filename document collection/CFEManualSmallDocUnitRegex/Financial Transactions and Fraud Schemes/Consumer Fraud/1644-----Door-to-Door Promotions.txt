Door-to-Door Promotions 
Sweepstakes promoters using a charity front offer the possibility of new cars and cash prizes 
to contributors. The raffle approach — tying the number of “chances” to a set amount —
helps drive up how much the victim is willing to give. A favored device of phony charities is 
to send school-age children door-to-door, saying they are raising money for antidrug 
programs or for a group that takes underprivileged kids on trips. Some of the children repeat 
what they are told in exchange for a few dollars. Others believe they will receive rewards and 
free trips when in fact they, too, are being scammed.
