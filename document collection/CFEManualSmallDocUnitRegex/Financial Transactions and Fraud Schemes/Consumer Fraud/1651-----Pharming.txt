Pharming
Pharming is an attack in which a user is fooled into entering sensitive data (such as a 
password or credit card number) into a malicious website that impersonates a legitimate 
website. It is different from phishing in that the attacker does not have to rely on having the 
user click on a link in the e-mail to direct him to the fake website. Pharming actually exploits 
a vulnerability in the DNS server software that allows a hacker to acquire the domain name 
for a site and redirect the website traffic from a legitimate site to a false one. So even though 
the user types in the correct website address, the pharming program sends the user to an 
illegitimate site that looks like the real thing. Unknowingly, the user is then providing 
passwords and information directly to the hacker.
