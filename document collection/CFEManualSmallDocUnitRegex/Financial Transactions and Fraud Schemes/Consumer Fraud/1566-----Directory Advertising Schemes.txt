Directory Advertising Schemes 
The essence of directory advertising schemes is the sale of advertising in a non-existent 
magazine or directory. A fake (or in some cases a real) directory is shown to the potential 
victim. The victim contracts and pays for display or classified advertising that is to appear 
some months in the future. By that time, the fraudster has disappeared.
