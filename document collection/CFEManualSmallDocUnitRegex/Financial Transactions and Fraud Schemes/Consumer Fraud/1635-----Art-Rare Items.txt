Art/Rare Items 
Land deals prey on the public’s reverence for real estate. The con who deals in art objects 
preys on a similar impulse — the reverence for the rare. Paintings worth little more than their 
canvas and oil are tagged as “masterpieces” sure to grow in value. The victims who fall for 
these scams are art novices who seem to unquestioningly believe the “dealer’s” appraisal of 
the objet d’art. 
 
This sort of willing victim will buy lithographic prints, mass-produced by the thousands, 
thinking they are purchasing a “limited edition.” Any anxieties the victims may develop are 
calmed by a promised 30-day no obligation trial and with “certificates of authenticity.” 
According to the FTC, the most popular artists to counterfeit are Salvador Dali, Pablo 
Picasso, Marc Chagall, and Joan Miro.
