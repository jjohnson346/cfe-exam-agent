Red Flag Rules 
On January 1, 2008, the Identity Theft Red Flag regulations (Red Flag Rules), which update 
sections of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, became effective. Issued 
by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and five Federal bank regulatory agencies, the Red 
Flag Rules require financial institutions and creditors (i.e., banking institutions, retailers, 
utilities, car dealers, etc.) to develop and implement a written identity theft prevention 
program to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft for both new and existing 
accounts in numerous industries, including financial services, utilities, health care, and 
telecommunications.  
 
The agencies also issued guidelines to assist financial institutions and creditors in developing 
and implementing a program, including a supplement that provides 26 examples of identity 
theft red flags. 
 
More information about the Red Flag Rules can be found in the “Financial Institution 
Fraud” chapter above.
