2010 Identity Fraud Survey Report 
According to the 2010 Identity Fraud Survey Report conducted by Javelin Strategy & Research, 
the number of identity fraud victims in the U.S. has increased to 11 million from 10 million 
reported in the 2009 report. Although the total annual fraud amount increased by 12.5 
percent over the previous year to $54 billion, the report found that detection and resolution 
efforts are working well.  
 
Some of the key findings of the survey were: 
• The mean consumer cost of identity fraud decreased 25 percent, from $496 per incident 
in 2008 to $373 per incident in 2009, as a result of faster detection, lower fraud amounts, 
and quicker resolution times.  
• Social networking fraud and potential threats will likely escalate in the upcoming years.  
One of the dangers of social networking sites is the public display of personal 
information. Personal pages and account profiles can expose sensitive, personally 
identifiable information, and hints on how to easily find it. Criminals can harvest this 
information to take over accounts or open fraudulent accounts. 
• Contrary to prior years’ data, online identity theft methods constituted 42 percent of 
fraud cases in 2009. The other significant group of known cases occur through 
traditional methods when a criminal can make direct contact with the consumer’s 
personal information. The common methods of access included: 
Financial Transactions  Consumer Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1757 
- Obtained from a lost or stolen wallet, checkbook, credit card, or other physical 
document 
- Accessed while conducting a purchase or transactionAccessed by friends, 
acquaintances, relatives, or in-home employees 
- Stolen from a company that handles your financial data 
- Stolen paper mail 
 
Although there is no universal definition of identity theft, the Department of Justice offers 
the following definition: 
 
Identity theft and fraud are crimes in which someone wrongfully obtains and uses another 
person’s personal data in some way that involves fraud or deception, typically for economic 
gain.  
 
Personal identification data includes name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, 
mother’s maiden name, or other identifying information. The perpetrator exploits this 
information by opening bank or credit card accounts, taking over existing accounts, 
obtaining loans, leasing cars or apartments, or applying for wireless telephone and utilities 
services in the victim’s name without his knowledge.  
 
Technological advancements that facilitate the electronic transfer of personal information 
and the transmission of financial transactions have greatly contributed to the recent increase 
in occurrences of identity theft. As such technologies continue to develop, this type of fraud 
will likely remain a serious problem that affects many people.
