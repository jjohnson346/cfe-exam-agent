Confronting the Fraudster 
If the fraudster has been identified and is to be confronted, the fraud examiner should keep 
the following in mind: 
• On initial contact, call the fraudster by the wrong name; generally he will then produce 
identification in the name of the victim. 
• Try to establish the fraudster’s true identity.

• For safety reasons, use caution when confronting the thief; never forget that the 
fraudster could be a convicted felon who does not want to go back to prison.
