Common Ways of Obtaining Information 
While you might think that you are careful with your personal information, in reality, a lot of 
information can be easily found and acquired by identity thieves without you even realizing 
it. An innocent inquiry for the most basic of information, such as verifying an address or 
mother’s maiden name for a banker’s files, can be the start of a financial nightmare. The 
most common ways information is obtained are: 
• Sorting through discarded trash 
• Shoulder surfing 
• Rifling through coworker’s desk drawers 
• Theft of mail — incoming or outgoing 
• Using an accomplice within the organization  
• Soliciting identifiers through false job application schemes 
• Telephone companies, health clubs, and schools 
• Certifications and licenses placed on workplace walls  
• Using pretext, ruse, or gag calls  
• Rental and loan applications  
• Public records  
• The Internet
