Downloading of Files 
Comparison of issue files to disbursement files can determine if funds are being used to 
place new policies by using the equity of old policies. For example, computer-assisted 
auditing tools and techniques (CAATTs) are used to download and compare electronic files, 
such as comparing the administrative file on group business to the Social Security file to 
determine if the company is paying out monthly payments on people who have passed away.
