Equity Funding 
Equity funding is the process of using existing premium/policy values to finance new 
businesses. So long as the insured is aware of what is being done by the agent and fully 
understands the long-range method of payment on the new contract, there is no apparent 
underwriting irregularity. 
 
Equity funding techniques, also known as piggybacking, usually do not produce quality 
business. Furthermore, the company increases the amount of life insurance on the books but 
receives little or no new funds while incurring increased sales and administrative expenses 
associated with the issue of that new business. 
 
Each jurisdiction has its own requirements on piggybacking as it relates to replacement 
insurance. Companies must comply with these regulations to prevent being fined or the 
possibility that the company’s insurance license can be suspended or taken away for 
noncompliance.

Equity funding irregularities might involve improper financial benefits to field personnel as 
well as annual incentive compensation bonuses paid to management if applicable. The fraud 
examiner should determine what financial benefit will occur from an improper equity 
transaction.
