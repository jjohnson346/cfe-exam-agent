RECEIVABLE TURNOVER 
Receivable turnover is defined as net sales on account 
divided by average net receivables. It measures the number of times accounts receivable is 
turned over during the accounting period. In other words, it measures the time between on-
 account sales and collection of funds. This ratio is one that uses both income statement and 
balance sheet accounts in its analysis. If the fraud includes fictitious sales, this bogus income 
will never be collected. As a result, the turnover of receivables will decrease.
