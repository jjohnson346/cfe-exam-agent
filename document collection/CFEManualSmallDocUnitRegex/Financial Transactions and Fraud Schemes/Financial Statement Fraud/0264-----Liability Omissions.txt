Liability Omissions 
Typical omissions include the failure to disclose loan covenants or contingent liabilities. 
Loan covenants are agreements, in addition to or as part of a financing arrangement, that a 
borrower has promised to keep as long as the financing is in place. The agreements can 
contain various types of covenants, including certain financial ratio limits and restrictions on 
other major financing arrangements. Contingent liabilities are potential obligations that will 
materialize only if certain events occur in the future. A corporate guarantee of personal loans 
taken out by an officer or a private company controlled by an officer is an example of a 
contingent liability. The company’s potential lia bility, if material, must be disclosed.
