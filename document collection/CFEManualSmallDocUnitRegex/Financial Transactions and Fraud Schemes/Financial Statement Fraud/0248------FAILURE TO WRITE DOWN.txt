FAILURE TO WRITE DOWN 
Companies are required to accrue losses on uncollectible receivables when the criteria in 
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, are met. 
Companies struggling for profits and income may be tempted to omit the recognition of 
such losses because of their negative impact on income.
