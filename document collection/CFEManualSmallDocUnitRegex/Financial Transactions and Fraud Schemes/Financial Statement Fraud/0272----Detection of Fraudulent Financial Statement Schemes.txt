An anonymous tip was received that the paymaster is stealing cash from the company. 
Lately, he has been seen driving a new BMW and has taken expensive vacations. The 
president of the company wants to follow up on the tip. Although the paymaster is a 
longtime, trusted employee, the president asks the fraud examiner to determine if the 
paymaster has been stealing. Although there are several ways to proceed with the 
investigation, the fraud examiner with accounting knowledge decides to first compare this 
year’s total salary expense with last year’s balance. He theorizes that if the paymaster is 
dishonest, he might be concealing the theft in the salaries expense account. Past experience 
has taught the fraud examiner to look  in the most obvious place first. 
 
The examiner notes that the balance of $220,000 in the salary expense account this year is 
significantly larger than the $180,000 balance last year. He asks the owner if there is an 
increase in the number of employees and how large across-the-board raises were this year. 
He discovers that the work force has not incr eased and all employees, including the owner, 
received 10 percent raises. He recalculates this year’s salaries by increasing last year’s 
salaries 10 percent and determines that the balance in the salary ex pense account should be 
approximately $198,000 ($180,000 x 1.10 = $198,000). He now believes that excess 
salaries went to someone.  
 
The next step is to follow the overstatement in salary expense backward from the income 
statement through the accounts and journal entries to the source documents—the payroll 
checks in this case. He finds that there are 12 checks payable to John Doe, an employee 
who quit in January of last year. He compares the endorsements on John Doe’s checks with 
those on the paymaster’s checks and notices di stinct similarities in the signatures. Armed 
with this evidence, he interviews the paymaster who confess es that he has stolen $22,000 
and concealed the theft by issuing payroll checks to a nonexistent employee, checks that he 
subsequently endorsed and cashed.  
 
Obviously, this example is relatively simple; but most fraud schemes are simple, especially 
for an examiner who understands concealment techniques and accounting. 
 
Other detection techniques are available for deter mining if the paymaster is stealing. These 
include running a computer listing of all employees who do not elect insurance coverage and 
other payroll withholdings (withholdings on fictitious employees create additional 
concealment problems for perpetrators), having someone else distribute the checks, and 
checking Social Security numbers of all active employees. Any of these methods might have

revealed the spurious paychecks to John Doe. The approach shows, however, how an 
understanding of accounting can be invaluable for detecting fraud.
