Certification Obligations for CEOs and CFOs 
One of the most significant changes effected by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is the requirement 
that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of public companies 
personally certify annual and quarterly SEC filings. These certifications essentially require 
CEOs and CFOs to take responsibility for their companies’ financial statements and prevent 
them from delegating this responsibility to their subordinates and then claiming ignorance 
when fraud is uncovered in the financial statements.  
 
There are two types of officer certifications mandated by Sarbanes-Oxley: criminal 
certifications, which are set forth in section 906 of the Act and codified at 18, U.S.C., § 1350, 
and civil certifications, which are set forth in section 302.
