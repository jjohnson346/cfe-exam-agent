OFF-BALANCE SHEET  TRANSACTIONS 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act directed the SEC to issue  rules that require the disclosure of all 
material off-balance sheet transactions by publicly traded companies. The rules require 
disclosure of “all material off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations 
(including contingent obligations), and other relationships the company may have with

unconsolidated entities or persons that may have a material current or future effect on the 
company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, liquidity, capital expenditures, 
capital resources, or significant components of revenues or expenses.” These disclosures are 
required in all annual and quarterly SEC reports. 
 
PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
Section 401 also directed the SEC to issue rules on pro forma financial statements. These 
rules require that pro forma financials must not contain any untrue statements or omissions 
that would make them misleading and require that the pro forma financials be reconciled to 
GAAP. These rules apply to all pro forma financial statements that are filed with the SEC or 
that are included in any public disclosure or press release.  
 
PROHIBITIONS ON PERSONAL LOANS TO EXECUTIVES 
Section 402 makes it illegal for public companies to make personal loans or otherwise extend 
credit, either directly or indirectly, to or for any director or executive officer. There is an 
exception that applies to consumer lenders if the loans are consumer loans of the type the 
company normally makes to the public, and on the same terms. 
 
RESTRICTIONS ON INSIDER TRADING 
Section 403 establishes disclosure requirements for stock transactions by directors and 
officers of public companies, or by persons who own more than 10 percent of a publicly 
traded company’s stock. Reports of changes in  beneficial ownership by these persons must 
now be filed with the SEC by the end of the second business day following the transaction. 
 
Under § 306, directors and officers are also prohibited from trading in the company’s 
securities during any pension fund blackout periods. This restriction only applies to 
securities that were acquired as a result of their employment or service to the company. A 
blackout period is defined as any period of more than three consecutive business days in 
which at least 50 percent of the participants in the company’s retirement plan are restricted 
from trading in the company’s securities. If directors or officers violate this provision, they 
can be forced to disgorge to the company all profits received from the sale of securities 
during the blackout period.

CODES OF ETHICS FOR SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS  
Pursuant to § 406 of the Act, the SEC must establish rules that require public companies to 
disclose whether they have adopted a code of ethics for their senior financial officers, and if 
not, to explain the reasons why. The rules require immediate public disclosure any  
time there is a change of the code of ethics or a waiver of the code of ethics for a senior 
financial officer.  
 
ENHANCED REVIEW OF PERIODIC FILINGS 
Section 408 of the Act now requires the SEC to make regular and systematic reviews of 
disclosures made by public companies in their periodic reports to the SEC. Reviews of a 
company’s disclosures, including its financial statements, must be made at least once every 
three years. Prior to this enactment, reviews were typically minimal and tended to coincide 
with registered offerings. 
 
REAL TIME DISCLOSURES  
Under § 409, public companies must publicly disclose information concerning material 
changes in their financial condition or operations. These disclosures must be “in plain 
English” and must be made “on a rapid and current basis.”
