Market Manipulation 
Market manipulation consists of a series of transactions designed to artificially raise or lower 
price or to give the appearance of trading activity for the purpose of inducing others to buy 
or sell. This is especially common with penny stocks or micro-cap stocks. Penny stocks are 
low-priced (usually less than $5), speculative securities that are registered but do not meet the 
listing requirements of an exchange. Micro-cap just means the stocks of companies with very 
small market capitalization. Once the price has been artificially inflated the stock is sold to 
unsuspecting victims.
