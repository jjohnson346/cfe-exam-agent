Is It a Security or an Investment? 
Some states include an investment fraud provision in their securities law. The advantage of 
this provision, if available, is that usually “investment” is much more broadly defined than 
“security.” For example, in Florida, investment means the commitment of money or 
property principally induced by a representation that an economic benefit may be derived. In 
many cases, it is much easier to prove that there is an investment than to show there was a 
security sold. The violation, of course, would be the fraud in relation to the sale of the 
investment and would constitute a third degree felony in the State of Florida.
