Churning  
Churning is the excessive trading of a customer account for the purpose of generating 
commissions. For securities and options there is a commission charged when the trade is 
entered into and when the trade is liquidated. Commodity futures have a round-turn 
commission scheme meaning that the commission covers both the purchase and sale. 
Commissions on commodity futures are not charged until the trade is closed out.
