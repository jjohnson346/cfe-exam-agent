Statistical Sampling 
Companies with inventory accounts typically have enormous populations of source 
documents. Statistical sampling allows the fraud examiner to inspect key attributes on a 
smaller portion (or sample) of those documents. For example, the examiner may select a 
statistically valid, random sample of purchase requisitions to determine that all requisitions in 
the sample selected were properly approved. Statistical sampling enables the examiner to 
predict the occurrence rate for the population and, therefore, determine with some accuracy 
the error rate or the potential for fraud. 
 
Other items that may be sampled on a statistical basis include the following: 
• Receiving reports 
• Perpetual inventory records 
• Raw materials requisitions 
• Shipping documents 
• Job cost sheets
