Theft of Inventory and Other Assets 
While the misuse of company property might be a problem, the theft of company property is 
obviously of greater concern. Losses resulting from larceny of company assets can run into 
the millions of dollars. Most schemes where inventory and other non-cash assets are stolen 
fall into one of four categories: larceny schemes, asset requisition and transfer schemes, 
purchasing and receiving schemes, and false shipment schemes.
