The Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
On July 30, 2002, President Bush signed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This law significantly 
changed the laws of corporate governance and the rules and regulations under which 
accounting firms and corporations must operate. Additionally, certain provisions 
considerably increased the responsibilities of management and the accounting profession 
with regard to fraud. Since the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) has issued numerous SEC Releases that support and expand the Act’s 
requirements. Below is a summary of some of the most important provisions of Sarbanes-
 Oxley and the corresponding SEC rules that re late to fraud detection and prevention. More 
information about Sarbanes-Oxley can be found in the chapter entitled “The Law Related to 
Fraud” in the Law section of the Fraud Examiners  Manual. 
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed in July 2010, 
allows small public companies (those with less than $75 million in market cap) a permanent 
exemption from section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
