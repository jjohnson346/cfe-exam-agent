Testify to Findings 
Certified Fraud Examiners might testify to the findings of an examination. Although this 
step is not always necessary (for example, in cases that do not proceed to trial), it is 
important that all examinations be conducted under the premise that the case will go to trial 
and testimony will be required. Keeping this premise in mind helps the fraud examiner 
remember to take the time to perform the examination scrupulously.
