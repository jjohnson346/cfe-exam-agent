Obtain Evidence 
Certified Fraud Examiners are responsible for gathering and maintaining custody of 
evidence that will either confirm or refute a fraud allegation. The available evidence might 
demonstrate that the fraud allegation is without merit. Such evidence is equally as important 
as evidence that might prove the commission of fraud.
