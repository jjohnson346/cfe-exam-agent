Some of the examples of testing auditors may perform to address the risk of fraudulent 
financial reporting include: 
• Revenue recognition—Performing substantive analytical procedures relating to revenue 
using disaggregated data (for example, comparing revenue reported by month and by 
product line during the current reporting period with comparable prior periods); 
confirming with customers relevant contract terms; or questioning staff about shipments 
near the end of a period. 
• Inventory quantities—Examining inventory records to identify locations or items that 
require specific attention during or after the physical inventory count; performing a more 
rigorous examination of the count, such as examining contents of boxed items; and 
conducting additional testing of count sheets, tags, or other records. 
• Management estimates—Developing or engaging  a specialist to develop an independent 
estimate for comparison to management’s estimate and gathering further information to 
help evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and underlying assumptions.
