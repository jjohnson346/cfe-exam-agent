Private Securities Litigation Reform Act  
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 drastically changed the procedures and 
proof required in securities fraud cases. It also included additional responsibilities for 
independent auditors of public companies. Under the Act, each audit of the financial 
statements of a public company must include the following: 
• Procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of detecting illegal acts that would 
have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. 
• Procedures designed to identify related-party transactions that are material to the 
financial statements or otherwise require disclosure therein.

• An evaluation of whether there is substantial doubt about the ability of the issuer to 
continue as a going concern during the ensuing fiscal year. 
 
The term illegal act is defined to mean any act or omission “that violates any law, rule, or 
regulation having the force of law.” 
 
Additionally, if in the course of an audit, an auditor “detects or otherwise becomes aware 
that an illegal act (whether or not perceived to have a material effect on the financial 
statements of the issuer) has or might have occurred,” the auditor must then: 
• Determine and consider the possible effect of the illegal act on the financial statements 
of the company, including any contingent monetary effects such as fines, penalties, and 
damages; 
• Inform the appropriate level of management “as soon as practicable”; and 
• Assure that the audit committee (or the board of directors in the absence of an audit 
committee) is adequately informed of the illegal acts that have been detected unless such 
acts are “clearly inconsequential.” 
 
The Reform Act provides further that the auditor must take notice of what, if any, action is 
taken by the company in response. If the auditor concludes that the illegal act has a material 
effect on the financial statements of the company, the auditor must then determine: 
• Whether senior management has taken “tim ely and appropriate remedial actions,” and 
• Whether the failure to take remedial action is “reasonably expected to warrant departure 
from a standard report of the auditor, when made, or warrant resignation from the audit 
engagement.”  
 
If the auditor concludes that senior management has failed to appropriately address the 
situation, he must report his conclusions to the board of directors. If the board receives such 
a report, the board is then required to notify the SEC within one business day and send a 
copy of the SEC notice to the auditor. If the auditor does not receive a copy of this notice 
before the one-day deadline, then the auditor is required to furnish the SEC with a copy of 
his report to the board. 
 
The auditor is provided with some protection, however. The Act expressly provides that the 
auditor cannot be liable in a private action for any statements contained in the auditor’s 
report to the SEC.
