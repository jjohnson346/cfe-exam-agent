Auditing, Quality Control, and Independence Standards and Rules 
Section 103 of the Act requires the Board to establish standards for auditing, quality control, 
ethics, independence, and other issues relating to audits of publicly traded companies. 
Although the Act places the responsibility on the Board to establish audit standards, it also 
sets forth certain rules that the Board is required to include in those auditing standards. 
These rules include the following:  
• Audit work papers must be maintained for at least seven years. 
• Auditing firms must include a concurring or second partner review and approval of audit 
reports, and concurring approval in the issuance of the audit report by a qualified person 
other than the person in charge of the audit. 
• All audit reports must describe the scope of testing of the company’s internal control 
structure and must present the auditor’s findings from the testing, including an 
evaluation of whether the internal control structure is acceptable, a description of 
material weaknesses in internal controls, and any material noncompliance with controls.
