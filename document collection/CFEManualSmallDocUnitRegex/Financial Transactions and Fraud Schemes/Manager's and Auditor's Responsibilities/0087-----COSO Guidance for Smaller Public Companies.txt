COSO Guidance for Smaller Public Companies 
In 2006, COSO issued a report titled Internal Control over Financial Reporting— Guidance for 
Smaller Public Companies, which provides guidance for small companies on implementing cost-
 effective internal controls over financial reporting as required under Sarbanes-Oxley Section 
404. While acknowledging that smaller public companies often face unique and 
disproportionate challenges in applying sound internal control practices, COSO noted that 
the benefits of good internal control outweigh the costs and add significant value to an 
organization. The guidance is split between three volumes and contains 20 principles related 
to the Internal Control—Integrated Framework, as well as 75 attributes related to these principles.  
 
The report outlines several methods small companies can utilize to establish and enhance 
cost-effective internal controls, such as widening and directing control from the top, 
emphasizing effective oversight on the part of the board of directors, compensating for 
limited segregation of duties, leveraging the abilities of commercially available information 
technology, and using management’s monitoring activities to offset shortcomings in other 
control areas. The report also discusses ways to achieve further efficiencies in designing, 
implementing, and assessing controls, including focusing on risk, adjusting documentation 
policies to fit the needs of the organization, and viewing internal control as an integrated 
process.
