Procedures for Handling Complaints 
The audit committee is required to establish procedures (e.g., a hotline) for receiving, 
retaining, and dealing with complaints, including confidential or anonymous employee tips, 
regarding irregularities in the company’s accounting methods, internal controls, or auditing 
matters.  
 
The SEC does not require any specific procedures for handling complaints, but rather allows 
the audit committee to determine the most appropriate procedures for the company’s 
circumstances. Included in this flexibility is the ability of the audit committee to defer the 
receipt and screening of the complaints to another party, such as a messaging service. 
However, when complaints are received by a party outside of the audit committee, the 
procedures should dictate that the tips are ultimately directed to the audit committee for 
resolution. Further, the procedures should be designed such that management is not 
exclusively responsible for receiving and screening the complaints, to prevent unscrupulous 
managers from mishandling complaints or retaliating against employee complainants. 
Ultimately, the enactment of formal procedures should encourage the disclosure of concerns 
and promote proper conduct throughout the organization. The established procedures 
should also allow the audit committee to be alerted to potential problems before serious 
consequences arise.
