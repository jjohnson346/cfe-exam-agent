REVIEWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES FOR BIASES THAT COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT DUE TO FRAUD  
In preparing financial statements, management is responsible for making a number of 
judgments or assumptions that affect significant accounting estimates. Fraudulent financial 
reporting is often accomplished through intentional misstatement of these estimates. In 
performing the audit, the auditor should consider whether the differences between estimates 
supported by the audit evidence and the estimates included in the financial statements 
indicate a possible bias on the part of management. If so, the auditor should perform a 
retrospective review of significant accounting estimates of the prior year. This review should 
provide the auditor with additional information about whether management may have a bias 
in presenting the current-year estimates.
