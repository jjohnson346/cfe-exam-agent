Civil and Criminal Penalties for Noncompliance 
Depending on which particular provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is violated, the penalties 
can be severe. In addition to creating additional criminal offenses (e.g., the whistleblower 
retaliation crime discussed above), it increases the jail term for existing crimes such as mail 
fraud and wire fraud from five to twenty years. It also makes it a crime to destroy documents 
and requires auditors of public companies to keep work papers for at least five years. 
 
The Act also authorizes the SEC to freeze questioned assets during an investigation. 
Additionally, section 304 of the Act requires that if a public company is required to prepare 
an accounting restatement due to misconduct that results in material non-compliance with 
any financial reporting requirement, the CEO and CFO shall reimburse the company for:  
• Any bonuses or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation that they received 
during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing (whichever is 
earlier) of a financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement; and 
• Profits on the sale of company securities during such 12-month period.
