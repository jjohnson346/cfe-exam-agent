PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 3—Audit Documentation  
PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 3, Audit Documentation, provides general guidance on the 
content and extent of the documentation public company auditors should prepare when 
conducting audits of financial statements, audits of internal control over financial reporting, 
and reviews of interim financial information.  
 
Audit documentation includes all memoranda, confirmations, correspondence, schedules, 
audit programs, and letters of representation prepared and obtained during the audit 
engagement. This documentation “should be prepared in sufficient detail to provide a clear 
understanding of its purpose and source, and the conclusions reached.” Additionally, 
because the documentation serves as the foundation for the representations in the auditor’s 
report, the standard asserts that it should: 
• Demonstrate that the engagement was conducted in compliance with the standards of 
the PCAOB,  
• Support the basis for the auditor’s conclusions concerning all relevant financial 
statement assertions, and  
• Demonstrate that the underlying accounting records agree to or reconcile with the 
financial statements.  
 
To meet these requirements, the standard states that audit documentation should “contain 
sufficient information to enable an experienced auditor, having no previous connection with 
the engagement: 
• To understand the nature, timing, extent, and results of the procedures performed, 
evidence obtained, and conclusions reached, and 
• To determine who performed the work and the date such work was completed as well as 
the person who reviewed the work and the date of such review.”

The standard also requires auditors to retain audit documentation for seven years from the 
date the auditors’ report is released or, if no report is issued, from the date the audit work is 
substantially completed.  
 
The full text of the auditing standard, which also includes guidance about documentation of 
specific matters and subsequent changes to audit documentation, can be found on the 
PCAOB’s website (www.pcaobus.org).
