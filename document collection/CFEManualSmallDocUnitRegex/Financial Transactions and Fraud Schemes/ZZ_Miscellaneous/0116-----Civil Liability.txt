Civil Liability 
Section 806 of the Act creates a civil liability for an employer who, out of retaliation, fires, 
demotes, suspends, threatens, harasses, or discriminates against an employee who provided 
information or otherwise assisted in an investigation of fraudulent activity. Employees are 
also protected against retaliation for filing, testifying, participating, or otherwise assisting in a 
proceeding filed or about to be filed relating to an alleged violation of securities laws and 
regulations. Employees that were retaliated against in such a manner are entitled to 
compensatory damages under Section 806, including reinstatement with back pay and 
interest and compensation for legal fees. It should be noted, however, that this provision 
does not provide protection to all whistleblowers as it only covers employees of publicly 
traded companies.
