IIA's IPPF—Practice Guide: Internal Auditing and Fraud  
To help auditors comply with their responsibilities pertaining to fraud, the IIA, in December 
of 2009, released IPPF—Practice Guide: Internal Auditing and Fraud  (Practice Guide). Although 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.245 
not mandatory, the guidance included in the Practice Guide is strongly recommended. 
Specifically, the Practice Guide addresses fraud awareness; potential fraud indicators; roles 
and responsibilities for fraud prevention and detection; the internal auditor’s role during 
audit engagements; fraud risk assessment; fraud prevention and detection; fraud 
investigation; and forming an opinion on internal controls related to fraud. The Practice 
Guide also includes an appendix that lists IPPF Practice Advisories that pertain to fraud. 
Following is a discussion of selected topics from the Practice Guide. The complete guide is 
available from the IIA’s website (www.theiia.org).
