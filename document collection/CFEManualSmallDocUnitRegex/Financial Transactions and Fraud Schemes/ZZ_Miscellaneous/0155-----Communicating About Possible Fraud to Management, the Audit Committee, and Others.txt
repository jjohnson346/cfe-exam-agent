Communicating About Possible Fraud to Management, the Audit Committee, and Others 
AU section 316 states, “Whenever an auditor has determined that there is evidence that 
fraud may exist, the matter should be brought to the attention of an appropriate level of 
management.” It is considered appropriate to do  so even if the matter might be considered 
inconsequential. Fraud involving senior management and fraud (by anyone) that causes a 
material misstatement should be reported directly to those charged with governance. 
 
If the auditor has identified risks of material misstatement due to fraud that have continuing 
control implications, the auditor should consider whether these risks should be

communicated to those charged with governance. Conversely, the auditor should consider 
whether the absence of controls to deter, detect, or prevent fraud should be reported.  
 
The disclosure of possible fraud to parties other than the client’s senior management and 
those charged with governance is ordinarily not part of the auditor’s responsibilities and may 
be precluded by the auditor’s legal or ethical obligations of confidentiality, unless the matter 
is reflected in the auditor’s report. 
 
However, AU section 316 points out that there may be a duty to disclose the information to 
outside parties in the following circumstances: 
• To comply with certain legal and regulatory requirements (e.g., SEC rules); 
• To inform successor auditors pursuant to AU section 315, Communications Between 
Predecessor and Successor Auditors; 
• In response to a subpoena; and 
• To a funding agency or other specified agency in accordance with the requirements for 
audits of entities that receive governmental financial assistance.
