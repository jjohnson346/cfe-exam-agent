Reporting Standards for Financial Audits 
For reporting standards for financial statement audits, GAGAS incorporate the following 
four AICPA generally accepted standards of reporting: 
• The auditors’ report must state whether the financial statements are presented in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 
• The auditors’ report must identify any circumstances in which GAAP was not 
consistently applied in the current period in relation to the preceding period.  
• Informative disclosures in the financial statements are considered reasonably adequate 
unless otherwise stated in the auditors’ report. 
• The auditors’ report must contain either an expression of opinion regarding the financial 
statements, taken as a whole, or an assertion that such an opinion cannot be expressed. 
If an overall opinion cannot be expressed, the reasons should be stated. In all cases 
where an auditor’s name is associated with financial statements, the report should 
contain a clear-cut indication of the character of the auditor’s work, if any, and the 
degree of responsibility the auditor is taking. 
 
GAGAS prescribe eight additional reporting standards for government financial audits. They 
are: 
• The auditors’ report should specifically state that the audit was performed in accordance 
with GAGAS. 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.255 
• The auditors’ report should either (1) describe  the scope of the auditors’ testing internal 
control over financial reporting and compliance with laws, regulations, and provisions of 
contracts or grant agreements, and present the results of those tests or an opinion, if 
sufficient work was performed, or (2) refer to separate reports containing that 
information. If a separate report is used, the auditors’ report should state that the 
separate report is an integral part of the audit and should be considered in assessing the 
results of the audit.  
• Auditors should report (1) significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal 
control, (2) all material instances of fraud and illegal acts, and (3) significant violations of 
contract provisions or grant agreements and abuse. In some situations, the auditors 
should report the occurrence of these problems directly to parties outside of the audited 
organization.  
• Auditors may add a separate paragraph or separate section of the auditors’ report to 
emphasize certain information that may be critical to the proper use and understanding  
of the audited financial statements. Examples of matters that require such emphasis may 
include significant uncertainties and catastrophic or unusual events.  
• Auditors have specific responsibilities related to potential material misstatements and 
restatements of previously-issued financial statements. In situations where auditors 
become aware of new information that previously issued financial statements were 
materially misstated and that management intends to restate and reissue the misstated 
financial statements, auditors should advise management to disclose the information and 
its impact on the financial statements to parties who rely on the financial statements. 
Additionally, the auditors must (1) evaluate the timeliness and appropriateness of 
management’s disclosure of the misstatements and the actions taken to correct the 
misstatements, (2) perform audit procedures sufficient to reissue or update the auditors’ 
report on the restated financial statements, and (3) report directly to appropriate officials 
when the audited entity does not take the necessary steps. 
• If the auditors’ report contains any disclosures regarding deficiencies in internal control, 
fraud, illegal acts, violations of contract provisions or grant agreements, or abuse, the 
report should also include the views of the organization’s responsible officials 
concerning the findings, conclusions, and recommendations, as well as any planned 
corrective actions. 
• If any pertinent information about the audited entity is prohibited by law or regulation 
from being disclosed to the general public, the auditors’ report should state the nature of 
the omitted information and the reason for its omission.  
• Government auditors should submit their audit reports to those charged with

governance, to the appropriate officials of the audited organization, to the parties 
requiring or arranging for the audit, to officials with oversight authority for the 
organization, to parties who may be responsible for acting on audit findings and 
recommendations, and to others who are authorized to receive such reports. 
Nongovernment auditors should distribute the report according to applicable auditing 
standards, as well as the agreement reached with the party contracting the audit.
