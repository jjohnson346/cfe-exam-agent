EXAMINING JOURNAL ENTRIES AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS FOR EVIDENCE OF POSSIBLE MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT DUE TO FRAUD  
Material misstatements of financial statements often involve recording inappropriate or 
unauthorized journal entries, or making adjustments to amounts reported in the financial 
statements that are not reflected in journal entries (e.g., consolidating adjustments or 
reclassifications). Therefore, the auditor should design procedures to test the appropriateness 
of journal entries recorded in the general ledger and of other adjustments (e.g., entries 
posted directly to financial statement drafts).
