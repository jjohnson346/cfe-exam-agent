Assist in the Detection and Prevention of Fraud 
Because of their education, experience, and training, Certified Fraud Examiners are uniquely 
qualified to assist companies with proactive fraud prevention and detection programs. 
Certified Fraud Examiners assist in the investigation of fraud allegations and also aid 
management with designing and implementing internal control systems so that fraud 
schemes will be less common and not go undetected. 
 
It is common for a Certified Fraud Examiner to hold another designation, such as Certified 
Public Accountant, Certified Protection Professional, or Certified Internal Auditor. Dealing 
with accounting and auditing matters often requires the opinions of these professionals. 
Although Certified Fraud Examiners might hold other designations, they are bound by the 
Certified Fraud Examiner Code of Professional Ethics, which specifically states, in part: 
 
A Certified Fraud Examiner, when conducting examinations, will obtain  evidence or other 
documentation to establish a reasonable basis for any opinion required. No opinion shall be 
expressed regarding the guilt or innocence of any person or party. 
 
This article means that the Certified Fraud Examiner will not express an opinion, even if 
personally convinced of the guilt of an individual. Determining the guilt or innocence of an 
individual is reserved for a judge and jury; the Certified Fraud Examiner is a gatherer of 
facts, not the ultimate judge of them.
