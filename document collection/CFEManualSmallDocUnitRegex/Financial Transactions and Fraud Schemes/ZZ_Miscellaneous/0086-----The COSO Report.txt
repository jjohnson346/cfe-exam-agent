The COSO Report 
In addition, in 1987, the Treadway Commission recommended that management of publicly 
held companies include with its management reports an acknowledgement of responsibility 
for internal controls and an assessment of its effectiveness in meeting those controls. The 
Treadway Commission formed the Committee on Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) to 
actualize its recommendations. In 1992, COSO issued Internal Control—Integrated Framework  
(followed by an addendum), which provided the following definition: 
 
Internal Control is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
achievement of objectives in the following categories:  
a)  reliability of financial reporting,  
b)  effectiveness and efficiency  of operations, and  
c) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
 
COSO also identified, for management, five interrelated components of internal control: 
  
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.203 
• The control environment  sets the tone of an organization, influencing the control 
consciousness of the organization and providing a foundation for all other control 
components. 
• Risk assessment  is an entity’s identification and assessment of risks relevant to achieving 
control objectives. 
• Control activities  are an entity’s control policies and procedures. 
• Information and communication  is the exchange of information in a way that allows 
employees to carry out their responsibilities. 
• Monitoring  is the process that assesses the control environment over time.  
 
These components combined form an integrated system of controls.
