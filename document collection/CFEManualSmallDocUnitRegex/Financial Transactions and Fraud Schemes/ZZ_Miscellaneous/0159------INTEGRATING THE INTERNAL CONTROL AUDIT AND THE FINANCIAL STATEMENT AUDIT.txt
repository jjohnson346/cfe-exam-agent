INTEGRATING THE INTERNAL CONTROL AUDIT AND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT AUDIT 
Auditing Standard No. 5 states that although the objectives of financial statement audits and 
audits of ICOFR are not identical, the two au dits should be integrated, with the auditor 
planning and performing the work to achieve the objectives of both audits. The auditor 
should design and perform the tests of controls in a manner that yields sufficient evidence to 
support both the auditor’s opinion at year-end and the auditor’s control risk assessment for 
the financial statement audit.
