ASSESSING RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT DUE TO FRAUD THROUGHOUT THE AUDIT 
During the performance of the audit, the auditor may identify conditions that either change 
or support a judgment regarding the assessment of risks. Examples include: 
• Discrepancies in the accounting records (e.g., transactions that are not recorded, 
unsupported or unauthorized balances or transactions, or last minute adjustments).

• Conflicting or missing evidential matter (e.g., missing or altered documents or records, 
unexplained items on reconciliations, or missing inventory). 
• Problematic or unusual relationships between the auditor and management (e.g., denial 
of access to records, facilities, employees, or customers; complaints by management 
about the conduct of the audit team; unusual delays in providing information; or 
unwillingness to add or revise disclosures).
