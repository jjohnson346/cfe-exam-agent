AU Section 316 — Consideration of Fraud in a Financial Statement Audit (Source: SAS Nos. 99 and 113) 
In 1996, the AICPA’s Auditing Standards Board issued SAS No. 82, Consideration of Fraud in a 
Financial Statement Audit, in response to questions and criticisms of the auditing and 
accounting profession’s lack of adequate addre ssing of the subject of fraud. Following the 
high-profile financial frauds that occurred in 2001 and 2002, the ASB replaced SAS No. 82 
with SAS No. 99, Consideration of Fraud in a Financial Statement Audit, to give expanded 
guidance to auditors for detecting material fraud. Per the AICPA, the standard was part of 
an effort to “restore investor confidence in U.S. capital markets and re-establish audited 
financial statements as a clear picture window into Corporate America.” The standard 
became effective for audits of financial statements for periods beginning on or after 
December 15, 2002, and is codified in AU section 316, Consideration of Fraud in a Financial 
Statement Audit. 
 
AU section 110, Responsibilities and Functions of the Independent Auditor,  states, “The auditor has 
a responsibility to plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether caused by error or fraud.” 
The purpose of AU section 316 is to “establis h standards and provide guidance to auditors 
in fulfilling that responsibility.”  
 
AU section 316 is divided into 10 main sections: 
• Description and characteristics of fraud 
• Importance of exercising professional skepticism 
• Discussion among engagement personnel regarding risk of material misstatement due to 
fraud 
• Obtaining information needed to identify risks of material misstatements due to fraud 
• Identifying risks that may result in material misstatements due to fraud 
• Assessing the identified risks after taking into account an evaluation of the entity’s 
programs and controls 
• Responding to the results of the assessment

• Documenting the auditor’s consideration of fraud 
 
Following is a brief description of each of these sections. Practitioners in this area should

standard can be obtained from the AICPA (www.aicpa.org).
