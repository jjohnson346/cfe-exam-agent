Fraud Prevention Programs 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, and other rules and 
regulations either require or strongly encourage the implementation of one or more fraud 
prevention programs. In most instances, management is responsible for the institution of 
such programs. 
 
These programs, as well as further details regarding management’s responsibility for fraud, 
are discussed in detail in the Fraud Prevention and Deterrence section of the Fraud 
Examiners  Manual. 
 
Certified Fraud Examiners, external auditors, and internal auditors also play key roles in the 
detection and deterrence of fraudulent financial reporting. Following is a discussion of their 
professional responsibilities.
