NEED RECOGNITION SCHEMES 
The typical fraud in the need recognition phase of the contract negotiation is a conspiracy 
between the buyer and contractor where an employee of the buyer receives something of 
value and in return recognizes a “need” for a particular product or service. The result of 
such a scheme is that the victim organization purchases unnecessary goods or services from 
a supplier at the direction of the corrupt employee.  
 
There are several trends that may indicate a need recognition fraud. Unusually high 
requirements for stock and inventory levels may reveal a situation in which a corrupt 
employee is seeking to justify unnecessary purchase activity from a certain supplier. An 
employee might also justify unnecessary purchases of inventory by writing off large numbers 
of surplus items to scrap. As these items leave the inventory, they open up spaces to justify 
additional purchases. Another indicator of a need recognition scheme is the defining of a 
“need” that can only be met by a certain supplier or contractor. In addition, the failure to 
develop a satisfactory list of backup suppliers may reveal an unusually strong attachment to a 
primary supplier — an attachment that is explainable by the acceptance of bribes from that 
supplier.
