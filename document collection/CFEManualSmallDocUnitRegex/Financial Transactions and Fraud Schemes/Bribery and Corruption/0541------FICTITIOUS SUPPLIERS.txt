FICTITIOUS SUPPLIERS 
Another way to eliminate competition in the solicitation phase of the selection process is to 
solicit bids from fictitious suppliers. This gives the appearance of a competitive bidding 
situation, when in fact only one real supplier bids on the job. Furthermore, the real 
contractor can raise his prices, since the other bids are fraudulent and sure to be higher than 
his own. In effect, the bids from fictitious suppliers serve to validate the exaggerated quote 
from the real contractor.
