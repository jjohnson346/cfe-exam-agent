Missing Documentation 
Missing or altered documentation is a red flag for any type of fraud scheme. Because 
concealment is a key fraud element, missing documents are a definite giveaway. Missing 
documents are of particular concern in construction lending. Experience has shown that 
seldom is a complete draw request submitted without some missing document.
