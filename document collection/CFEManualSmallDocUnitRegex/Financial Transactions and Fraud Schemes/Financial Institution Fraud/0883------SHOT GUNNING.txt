SHOT GUNNING 
Shot-gunning  is a fraud scheme in which a mortgage broker sends multiple home equity line of 
credit (HELOC) loans on the same property to different lenders at the same time. The 
borrower’s good credit, the use of stated in come products offered on many HELOCs, and 
the lender’s determination of the property’s value based on the equity in the home rather 
than on an appraisal all facilitate a fast closing process to ensure that all applications will be 
processed during the same timeframe. Due to the delay between the dates the loans are 
closed and the dates the liens are filed in the courthouse, lenders are not aware of the other 
liens when making their underwriting decisions. Each lender believes it is first in line with  
its lien.
