FORECLOSURE RESCUE SCAM RED FLAGS 
Red flags associated with foreclosure rescue scams include:  
• These scams often prey on elderly or long-time residents with large amounts of equity. 
• The borrower (either a straw or legitimate borrower) receives a remodeling allowance 
from a recruiter outside of closing. 
• The underwriter has noted on the closing instructions that a copy of the purchase 
contract must be provided at closing, so, unbeknownst to him, the seller signs a purchase 
contract at closing or the seller’s name is forged in order to meet that condition. 
• The seller on the transaction is delinquent or in foreclosure. 
• The HUD-1 settlement statement indicates that most of the seller’s equity outside of the 
mortgage payoff is going to a third-party.
