Linked Financing 
Large deposits are offered to a bank (usually br okered deposits) on the condition that loans 
are made to particular persons affiliated with the deposit broker. High returns are promised, 
but the loans are longer term than the deposits (hot money). Sometimes kickbacks are paid 
to the broker or banker.
