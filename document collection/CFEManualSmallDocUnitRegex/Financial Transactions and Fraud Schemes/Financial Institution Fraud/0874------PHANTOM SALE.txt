PHANTOM SALE 
Phantom sale  scams are particularly harmful because they involve the fraudulent acquisition of 
a homeowner’s property by filing a fraudulent deed. This scam does not happen at the 
origination of the loan, but rather it may occur without the homeowner’s knowledge, 
decades after the property was originally sold.  
 
The perpetrator identifies a property — typically belonging to an estate or an out-of-state 
owner — that is owned free and clear. He then  creates a fictitious quit claim deed which 
purports to grant all rights and title on the property to the fraudster. The true owner’s 
signature is forged on the deed, and the scammer files it in the real property records. Once 
the deed is filed, he applies for and executes a loan on the property (using a straw borrower). 
Often the value is inflated. He pockets 100 percent of the loan proceeds and disappears.
