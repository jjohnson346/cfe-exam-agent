Global Service Period Violations 
Some dishonest providers will bill for a major procedure—such as a surgery—as well as 
related procedures, when the fee for the major procedure already includes the fee for related 
procedures during the predefined time period (the global service period). This type of fraud 
is possible because most surgery includes all related services for a set number of days before 
and after the surgery. Detecting these abuses can be difficult because the examiner must 
determine which services are related to the surgery and which are not. This difficulty is 
compounded by the fact that such services may be rendered by more than one provider.
