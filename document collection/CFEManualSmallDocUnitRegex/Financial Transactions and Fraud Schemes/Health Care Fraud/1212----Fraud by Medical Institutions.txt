Fraud by Medical Institutions 
Fraud schemes perpetrated by institutions and their employees include those commonly 
used by doctors and other providers. However, the more common schemes in which 
hospitals are primarily involved include: 
• Filing of false cost reports. 
• DRG creep. 
• Billing for experimental procedures. 
• Improper contractual and other relationships with physicians. 
• Revenue recovery firms to (knowingly or unknowingly) bill extra charges.
