Modified Traditional Coverage 
Under this type of coverage, the medical practitioner is reimbursed through a fee-for-service 
arrangement. The patient is free to choose a provider and a claim is submitted for 
reimbursement by either the insured or the provider. It is a managed care model in that cost-
 cutting measures are in the form of utilization review, prior authorization, second surgical 
opinions, and hospital pre-authorizations.
