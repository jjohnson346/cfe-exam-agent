Failure to Pay Legitimate Claims 
The insurance company or carrier is required to pay any claim that is properly submitted, 
contains all the required the information, absent of fraud, and has benefits available. An 
insurance company might commit fraud when claims are consistently rejected even though 
the required information has been submitted. Many states have regulations regarding the 
amount of time an insurance company has to pay a “clean” claim — one that has all the 
needed information. Even if an insured has committed fraud in the past, and for some 
reason or another is still an insured, the insurance company must still adjudicate a valid 
claim.
