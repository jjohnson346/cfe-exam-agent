Altering Records 
In some instances, firms may actually alter medical records. For example, in one case a firm 
added more than $1,300 to a patient’s bill for video equipment that was supposedly used 
during surgery. In order to justify the fraudulent billing, the firm checked a box on the 
surgical record to indicate that the equipment had been used. After the original document 
was obtained, it showed that the box was not checked on the original form completed by the 
surgical staff.
