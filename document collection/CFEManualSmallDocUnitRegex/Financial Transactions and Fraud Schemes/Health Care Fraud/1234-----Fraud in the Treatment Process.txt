Fraud in the Treatment Process 
The following types of abuses can occur with regard to psychiatric treatment: 
• Extending the length of treatment programs or delaying discharges because patients have 
additional insurance benefits remaining. 
• The use of illegitimate, questionable, non-approved, or dangerous treatment programs 
and forms of therapy, such as brain wave synchronization, magnet therapy, memory 
retrieval/enhancement therapy, and deep sleep therapy 
• Engaging in excessive treatment of psychiatric patients such as thyroid testing, drug tests, 
or psychiatric evaluation tests.
