Health Care Compliance Programs 
Recently the government discovered a widespread “upcoding” scheme, in which numerous 
hospitals across the country routinely and fraudulently coded cases in their billing systems 
under a diagnostic related group (DRG) that caused Medicare to overcompensate the

providers by about 28 percent. These “optimization” programs crossed the line of legitimate 
billing and subsequent criminal and civil investigations followed. In dealing with such a large 
number of hospitals, the government utilized compliance programs, also known as corporate 
integrity agreements, to help minimize future instances of fraud without significantly 
damaging a community’s health care needs by sa nctioning or dismissing medical providers. 
 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General 
(OIG), is increasingly using corporate compliance programs in lieu of sanctions to control 
medical providers and related entities who have defrauded federal health care programs.  
 
The OIG has devised model compliance guidelines for hospitals, clinical laboratories, 
durable medical equipment companies, and home health companies. The entire contents of 
those model plans can be located on the United States Department of Health and Human 
Service’s website at www.hhs.gov. 
 
Compliance programs are simply a set of effective internal controls designed to ensure that 
company operations adhere to the guidelines, regulations, and laws affecting the 
organization. Ideally, these internal controls should complement controls that already are in 
place within the accounting system. This is imperative because many problems OIG 
investigates center around the financial operations of the company, such as billing and 
collections. Compliance efforts are meant to encourage a culture that fosters prevention, 
detection, and resolution of conduct that is outside established company policies. The 
Federal Sentencing Guidelines also encourage compliance programs in order to reduce 
criminal fines and penalties. 
 
The sentencing guidelines and the Department of Health and Human Services model plans 
have some basic characteristics to which a compliance program should adhere. The seven 
basic elements include: 
• Develop and distribute policies that define standards and procedures to be followed by 
the organization’s agents and employees. Specifically, the organization should establish 
standards of conduct that emphasize the organization’s commitment to compliancy in 
areas such as Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regulations; fraud and 
abuse laws; federal, state, and local laws; and corporate ethical policies, mission, and 
goals. Annually circulate to every employee a standards of conduct statement that 
requires the signatures of all directors, officers, managers, employees, and contractors 
certifying that they have read, understand, and agree to comply with its terms;

• Designate or hire a high-level employee who has ultimate responsibility to operate and 
monitor the compliance program and to report directly to the CEO or governing body. 
This employee would be much like the company’s own internal inspector general; 
• Use reasonable care to identify sanctioned providers and remove those individuals from 
any activity that would violate a law or regulation. This can be done by dismissing the 
provider or reassigning him to an area of the company that does not have direct contact 
with patients covered by government insurance, or to an area that is neither directly nor 
indirectly reimbursed by a government program. If a sanctioned party works in the 
supply division, and part of the costs of that division are allocated on the Medicare cost 
report, then this could constitute a violation;  
• Require regular training programs for all employees and contractors. Each entity should 
have some policy for educating managers, executives, and employees about fraud. This 
can be conducted during employee orientation and/or through ongoing training 
programs and other company communication methods. Initial and annual training for all 
staff, especially for those in the marketing, sales, and billing departments, is essential. 
Training should focus on billing policies and procedures, application of federal rules and 
regulations, disciplinary actions for non-compliance, personal responsibility of every 
employee to comply, CMS policies and procedures, and fraud and abuse laws; 
• Use various kinds of monitoring and proactive auditing systems to detect fraud and 
unusual trends to ensure compliance. There are many statistical aberrations that an 
experienced fraud examiner can monitor in a proactive manner to identify potential 
problem areas, such as noticeable variations in billing patterns. For instance, if suddenly 
there is a 200 percent increase in billing for physician consultations, the fraud examiner 
may wish to review those services to determine if simple office visits are being 
characterized fraudulently as more complex — and thus, more lucrative - consultations; 
• Establish and publicize a reporting system in which employees can report criminal 
conduct without fear of retribution (hotline or ombudsman program). Each employee in 
the company should know where to report suspicious, unethical, or illegal behavior. 
Steps should include establishing a self-disclosure policy, which outlines procedures for 
reporting law violations to the appropriate authorities, and a records retention policy, 
which sets standards on how long records should be stored and in what format 
(electronic media, original paper document, etc.). The Office of Inspector General also 
has a Provider Self-disclosure Program (discussed in detail in the Federal Register dated 
Oct. 30, 1998) that offers a cooperative effort in reporting problems; 
• Develop a system to respond to allegations, investigate those allegations, and, if needed, 
carry out the appropriate disciplinary measures. Be consistent and also discipline

individuals who fail to detect the offense due to negligence. The compliance program 
should outline specifically who will investigate suspected irregularities, and to whom 
these irregularities will be reported (i.e., management, internal investigators, law 
enforcement, and/or legal counsel); and 
• Regularly review for systemic weaknesses in company operations and/or policies and 
make changes as needed. 
 
Essentially, what a compliance program is designed to do is provide insurance for the 
provider. By taking every reasonable and prudent step possible, a provider will have 
demonstrated to a prosecutor, judge, or jury that he has taken steps to prevent fraudulent 
activity from pervading his operations. Consequently, the damage to a provider’s reputation, 
pocketbook, and freedom can be controlled and minimized to the fullest extent possible.
