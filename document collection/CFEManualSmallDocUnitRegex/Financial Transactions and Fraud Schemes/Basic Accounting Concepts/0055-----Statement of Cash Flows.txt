Statement of Cash Flows 
The statement of cash flows reports a company’s sources and uses of cash during the 
accounting period. This statement is often used by potential investors and other interested 
parties in tandem with the income statement to determine the true financial performance of 
a company during the period being reported. The nature of accrual accounting allows (and 
often requires) the income statement to contain many non-cash items and subjective 
estimates that make it difficult to fully and clearly interpret a company’s operating results. 
However, it is much harder to distort the amount of cold, hard cash that was received and 
paid during the year, so the statement of cash flows adds to the transparency of the financial 
statements.  
 
The following is the statement of cash flows for XYZ Company:
