Revenue Recognition 
In general, revenue is recognized or recorded when it becomes realized or realizable, and 
earned. These criteria are usually met when:  
• Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,  
• Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,  
• The seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and 
• Collectibility is reasonably assured.  
 
Therefore, revenue should not be recognized for work that is to be performed in subsequent 
accounting periods, even though the work may currently be under contract; the revenue 
should be recognized in the period in which the work is performed.
