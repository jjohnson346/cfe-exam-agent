COMPUTER PROGRAMS 
The computer can have a tremendous impact on fraud examinations. Generally, programs 
can be easily written that will identify suspicious activity without having to manually review a 
voluminous amount of data. This is more conducive to detecting fraud as well as  
being a more efficient use of a fraud examiner’s time. Computer programs can be written to 
identify the following: 
• Vendors with post office box addresses. 
• Vendors with addresses in common with employee addresses. 
• Contractors who were unsuccessful bidders who are now subcontractors. 
• Payments to a particular vendor over a specified period of time. 
• Vendor payments that were initiated or paid outside the normal system (for example, 
hand carried or approved). 
• Employees who are assigned to more than one contract on any given day.
