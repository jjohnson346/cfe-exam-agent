DETECTION - LABOR MISCHARGES
Labor mischarges can sometimes be detected by examining the following: 
• Distinctive labor-charging patterns on research and development. 
• Significant increases in charging to overhead accounts (for example, idle time, down 
time, and nonapplied time). 
• Reclassification or reorganization of employees from indirect to direct charges. 
• Changes in the labor-charging relationships between certain tasks or types of labor. 
• Decrease in indirect expense pools. 
• Increased labor hours with no corresponding increases in materials used or units 
shipped. 
• Actual hours and dollars consistently at or near budgeted amounts.
