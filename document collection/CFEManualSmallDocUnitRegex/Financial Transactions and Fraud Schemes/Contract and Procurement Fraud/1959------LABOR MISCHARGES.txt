LABOR MISCHARGES 
Labor costs are perhaps more susceptible to mischarging than are material costs, because 
employee labor can readily be charged to any contract. The only way to ensure that labor 
costs are charged to the correct account is to actually observe the work of each employee (to 
determine the contract on which he is working), then determine from the accounting records 
that the employee’s cost is charged to the proper contract. 
 
There are several schemes involving mischarged labor costs. Some of the more prominent 
ones are: 
• Transfer of labor costs. 
• Time and charges do not agree with contractor billing. 
• Fictitious time cards. 
• Changes made to individual time cards. 
• Time card charges by supervisors.
