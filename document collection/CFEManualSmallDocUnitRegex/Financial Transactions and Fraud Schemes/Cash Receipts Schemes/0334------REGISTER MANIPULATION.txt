REGISTER MANIPULATION 
Instead of using reversing entries, an employee might manually alter the register tape. Again, 
the purpose of this activity is to force a balance between the cash on hand and the actual 
cash received. An employee might use white-out to cover up a sale whose proceeds were 
stolen, or he might simply cross out or alter the numbers on the tape so that the register 
total and the cash drawer balance. This type of concealment is not common because, in 
general, the alterations will be noticeable.
