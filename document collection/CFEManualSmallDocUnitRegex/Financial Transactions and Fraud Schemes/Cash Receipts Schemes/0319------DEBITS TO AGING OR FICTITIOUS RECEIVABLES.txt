DEBITS TO AGING OR FICTITIOUS RECEIVABLES 
The same method discussed above is used when employees debit existing or fictitious 
accounts receivable in order to conceal skimmed cash. For example, an employee who has 
skimmed one customer’s payments might add the stolen amounts to aging accounts that are 
soon to be written off as uncollectible, or to very large accounts where a small debit might 
go unnoticed.

Some perpetrators also set up completely fictitious accounts and debit them for the cost of 
skimmed receivables. The employees then simply wait for the fictitious receivables to age 
and be written off as uncollectable. In the meantime, the fictitious receivables carry the cost 
of a skimming scheme where it will not be detected.
