Skimming Receivables
It is generally more difficult to conceal the skimming of receivables than the skimming of 
sales because receivables payments are expected. The victim organization knows the customer 
owes money and it is waiting for the payment to arrive. When unrecorded sales are skimmed, 
it is as though the sale never existed. But when receivables are skimmed, the absence of the 
payment appears on the books as a delinquent account. In order to conceal a skimmed 
receivable, a perpetrator must somehow account for the payment that was due to the 
company but never received. There are a number of common techniques fraudsters use to 
conceal the skimming of receivables.
