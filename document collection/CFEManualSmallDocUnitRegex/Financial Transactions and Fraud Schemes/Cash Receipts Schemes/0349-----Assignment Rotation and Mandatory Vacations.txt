Assignment Rotation and Mandatory Vacations 
Many internal fraud schemes are continuous in nature and require ongoing efforts by the 
employee to conceal defalcations. Mandatory job rotation is an excellent method of 
detecting cash fraud. By establishing a mandatory job or assignment rotation, the 
concealment element is interrupted. If mandatory vacations are within the company’s 
policies, it is important that during the employee’s absence, the normal workload of that 
employee be performed by another individual. The purpose of mandatory vacations is lost if 
the work is allowed to remain undone during the employee’s time off.
