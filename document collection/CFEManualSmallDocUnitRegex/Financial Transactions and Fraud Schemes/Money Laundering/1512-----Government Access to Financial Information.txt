Government Access to Financial Information 
On September 18, 2002, the Treasury Department issued regulations that provide federal law 
enforcement agencies with greater power to obtain financial information. The two-part 
regulation is an amendment to the Bank Secrecy Act regulations and was mandated by 
section 314 of the PATRIOT Act. 
Money Laundering  Financial Transactions   
1.1620                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
If a federal agency provides FinCEN with a “written certification” that a person, entity, or 
organization about whom information is sought “is reasonably suspected based on credible 
information to be engaged in…, terrorist acti vity or money laundering.” FinCEN may then 
require any financial institution to search its records to determine if it “maintains or has 
maintained accounts for, or has engaged in transactions with” the subject. 
 
The information reported is limited to the name or account number of each cited person, 
entity, or organization; the number of the matching account or transaction; and the Social 
Security number, taxpayer ID, passport number, date of birth, or other identifying 
information the subject gave when opening the account or conducting the transaction. 
 
The institution may not disclose the information to anyone other than FinCEN or the 
requesting agency. The institution also cannot disclose that the information has been 
requested or provided. It may, however, use the information in the request to determine 
whether an account will be opened or a transaction conducted, and to comply with  
BSA regulations. 
 
The term “financial institution” is defined as it is under the BSA and includes banks, broker-dealers, 
insurance companies, money services businesses, as well as car and airplane dealers, 
travel agents, and pawnbrokers.
