business. The fictitious revenue accounts for the illegal funds that are secretly inserted into 
the company.  
 
EXAMPLE 
ABC Used Cars encourages customers to pay with cash. If the customer pays in cash, 
he receives a discount that might be as high as 25 percent. The invoice, however, makes 
no mention of this cash discount. The company reports the full sales amount as income. 
Depending on the number of cars sold, the company can launder thousands of dollars 
in illegal income.
