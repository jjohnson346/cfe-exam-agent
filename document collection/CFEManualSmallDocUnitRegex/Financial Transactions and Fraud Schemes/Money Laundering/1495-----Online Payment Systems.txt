Online Payment Systems 
In response to market demand, online payment services, which accept funds in a variety of 
ways to transfer payment either to an individual or a merchant, are emerging. In addition, the 
increasing demand for new payment methods has led a growing number of online markets 
to embrace online payment systems, which set their own clearing and settlement terms and 
offer no consumer protection or financial regulation. Since most transactions through these 
service providers are considered final and provide no recourse to individuals who believe 
they have been defrauded, federal law enforcement agencies suggest that they have become a 
popular payment system for individuals perpetrating online fraud. 
 
Online payment systems are often vulnerable to money laundering because many of them 
function as international person-to-person payment systems, which cross jurisdictional 
boundaries, creating difficulties for authorities pursuing enforcement or legal actions.

Furthermore, many service providers do not have effective customer identification or 
recordkeeping practices while others promote anonymous payments.
