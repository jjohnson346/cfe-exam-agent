APPRAISAL FRAUD 
Appraisal fraud is often associated with money laundering schemes. Money launderers may

debts. Such schemes can conceal the true identity of the property owners and the true origin 
of the funds used in the transaction.  
 
Appraisal fraud occurs where appraisers fail to accurately evaluate the property, or when the 
appraiser deliberately becomes party to a scheme to defraud the lender, the borrower, or

buying/selling property at a price above/below its market value. In addition to manipulating

each time at a higher price, which tend to conceal the true purposes of the transactions.
