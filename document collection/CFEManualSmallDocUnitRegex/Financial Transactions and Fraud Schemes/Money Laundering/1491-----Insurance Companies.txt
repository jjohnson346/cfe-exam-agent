Insurance Companies 
Due to the recent growth in the financial products offered by insurance agents and brokers 
(including savings products, investment products, and tax planning services), the insurance 
industry has become increasingly attractive to money launderers. According to the 2007 
National Money Laundering Strategy, this de velopment is occurring primarily because 
insurance “agents and brokers now offer a range of investment services featuring financial 
products that can be purchased and subsequently transferred, redeemed or sold, creating 
new opportunities for money laundering.” Generally, the independent brokers and agents 
who often sell insurance products do not work directly for the insurance companies. As a 
result, these intermediaries may lack the knowledge or incentive to screen clients or to 
question payment methods, and it is this factor that money launderers often exploit.
