MONITORING ACCOUNTS 
While identification of customers is important, it is equally important to monitor the activity 
of accounts. The institution should identify unusual transactions that might not be consistent 
with the normal business of the customer. Unusual and dramatic changes in wire transfer, 
monetary instrument, and check transactions are important to identify. If unusual 
transactions or activities are noted, the institution should take some action to protect itself. 
The appropriate action in some cases might be to discuss the changes with the customer to 
find out the reasons for said inconsistencies. Increased transactions might be the result of an 
increase in sales or the result of a promotional activity. However, if the discussion leads to a 
reasonable suspicion that the transactions are illegitimate, the institution might be required to 
notify the appropriate government agency and/or file a Suspicious Activity Report.
