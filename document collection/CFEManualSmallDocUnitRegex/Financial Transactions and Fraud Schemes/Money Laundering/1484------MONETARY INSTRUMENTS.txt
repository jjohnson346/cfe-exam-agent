Money Laundering

MONETARY INSTRUMENTS 
In many instances, money launderers purchase, build, or renovate property with cash, wire 
transfers, or other payable-through accounts. This allows the integration of large sums of 
illicit money into legal financial systems. Later, if sold, it is difficult to relate the transaction 
to any criminal activity and therefore, successfully conceals the true origin of the illicit funds 
and their ownership.
