Overview of the Legal System

State Courts 
Most states use a three- or four-tier system. 
• Lower courts try misdemeanors and preliminaries for felony cases, as well as civil disputes 
below a certain dollar amount (e.g., $10,000 or less).  
• Higher-level trial courts (sometimes called Superior courts) try felony cases and civil disputes 
above a certain amount (e.g., $10,000 or more). 
• Appellate courts review trial court decisions. 
• Superior appellate courts, or Supreme courts, review lower appellate court decisions. 
 
Many states have different systems — at the trial court and appellate court levels — for trying 
civil and criminal cases. Local and state criminal courts might have limited jurisdiction; for 
example, some courts only handle traffic violations and minor offenses. Some jurisdictions 
include a small-claims civil court to hear cases involving no more than $2,000 to $3,000.
