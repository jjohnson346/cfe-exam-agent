Corporate Mens Rea 
When a corporation is being charged with a crime that requires proof of a mental state, the 
moving party must only show that the agent who committed the wrongdoing had the 
required state of mind. Thus, the required mental state is attributable to the corporation. For 
example, to impose liability against a corporation for fraud, the moving party must prove that 
an agent of the corporation made the alleged false statements with specific intent to defraud.
