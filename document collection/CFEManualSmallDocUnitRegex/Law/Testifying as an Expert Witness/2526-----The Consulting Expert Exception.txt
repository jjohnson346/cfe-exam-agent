The Consulting Expert Exception 
Although everything a expert witness receives, reviews, relies, produces, and says is generally 
discoverable, there is an exception of course: The rules of discovery generally protect 
communications between a consulting expert, the attorney, and the party from disclosure to 
adversaries.  
 
Specifically, the work of a consulting expert is generally not discoverable because it typically 
falls under the protection of the work product doctrine. To review, the work product doctrine 
prevents compelled disclosure of documents and tangible things prepared in anticipation of 
litigation. And because its protection extends to information prepared by or for a party or the 
party’s representative, including consultants, the work of a consulting expert is generally not 
discoverable. But otherwise protected materials may become discoverable through waiver, and 
Law  Testifying as an Expert Witness  
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.809 
the general test for waiver is whether the materials at issue have been disclosed in a manner 
inconsistent with keeping it from an adversary. 
 
The distinction between the protection afforded to consulting and testifying experts is 
something like this: when acting as “witnesses,” experts are bringing official information to 
the court and thus must disclose any contact with the case; when experts act as “consultants” 
or “associates” for attorneys or law enforcement, they are only assisting the attorney and do 
not have to disclose their involvement in the case. 
 
There is, of course, one trap for the unwary: Protection of work product performed by a 
consulting expert may be lost when a testifying expert reviews the work of a consulting expert. 
The rule is that if an expert will testify at trial, everything he does regarding the case must be 
turned over to the other side. If an expert works only as a consultant to the attorney, then his 
work product is not discoverable. But if a testifying  expert reviews the work of a consulting  
expert, then the work of the consultant expert will be discoverable. Just remember this: If you 
are hired to testify at trial, anything you used to form your opinion will be subject to review by 
the opposing party. This includes notes from other experts, documents received from the 
plaintiff or defendant, and any documents or notes from the attorney. Be sure to consult with 
the attorney before you review anything. If a document was given to you by someone other 
than the attorney, ask before you read it. Otherwise, you may inadvertently destroy the 
confidentiality or privilege of the material.
