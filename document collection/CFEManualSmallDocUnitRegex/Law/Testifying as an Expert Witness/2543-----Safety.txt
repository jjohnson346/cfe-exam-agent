Testifying as an Expert Witness


:


Safety 
This approach involves lulling the expert into a feeling of false security by not attacking him. 
After the expert feels secure, the opposing counsel might find a small hole in the expert’s 
testimony that can be enlarged quickly. This approach often is characterized by being friendly 
and conciliatory, by which the jury is made sympathetic to the cause of the opposing counsel. 
Opposing counsel also might attempt to achieve a certain amount of association with the 
witness that will make the witness want to help the opposing counsel to bring out 
information. Doing so may result in the witness giving information that otherwise would not 
have been given. With this additional information, it might be possible to find a chink or hole 
in the evidence and open it further.
