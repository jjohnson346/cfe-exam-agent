Testifying as an Expert Witness


:


Discrediting the Witness 
Discrediting the witness is based on proving that the expert is unworthy to be a credible 
witness instructor to the court. This often can be accomplished by showing that the expert is 
currently or has previously been grossly biased, prejudiced, or corrupt; been convicted of 
criminal activities; been shown to engage in immoral activities; made inconsistent statements; 
acquired a reputation for a lack of veracity; or exaggerated his qualifications. Discrediting also 
could consist of looking at the quality of the expert’s educational background to reveal any 
other unusual activities that might bias the witness or exclude him from the court as an expert.
