Direct Versus Circumstantial Evidence 
There are two basic types of admissible evidence:  direct evidence and circumstantial evidence. 
Direct evidence includes testimony that tends to prove or disprove a fact in issue directly, such 
as eyewitness testimony or a confession. Circumstantial evidence is evidence that tends to prove 
or disprove facts in issue indirectly, by inference. Many fraud cases are proved entirely by 
circumstantial evidence, or by a combination of circumstantial and direct evidence, but 
seldom by direct evidence alone. The most difficult element to prove in many fraud cases —
fraudulent intent — is usually proved circumstantially, and necessarily so, because direct proof 
of the defendant’s state of mind, absent a confession or the testimony of a co-conspirator, is 
impossible. 
 
Law  Basic Principles of Evidence 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.703 
In a circumstantial case, the court may instruct the jury that the prosecution must exclude all 
inferences from the facts other than its determination of guilt. Even if no such instruction is 
given, the Certified Fraud Examiner should apply the same standard in preparing a 
circumstantial case.
