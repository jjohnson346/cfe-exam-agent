General Points 
Either side can enter exhibits into the record, given the proper foundation. Once admitted, 
the evidence is available for use by either side. It does not matter who entered the item into 
evidence; either side can use it during questioning.  
 
It also does not matter when exhibits are admitted. They may be introduced into evidence 
during direct examination: opposing counsel is allowed to inspect the exhibit and then the 
witness confirms the exhibit, which has been marked Exhibit A (or Exhibit 1). Some courts 
use letters for exhibits while some court use numbers. Usually the exhibit is identified by 
which side enters it (e.g., Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1.)  
 
When everyone agrees, exhibits can be directly entered into the record, without foundational 
review, by stipulation — both parties sign the stipulation form, describing and acknowledging 
the exhibit.
