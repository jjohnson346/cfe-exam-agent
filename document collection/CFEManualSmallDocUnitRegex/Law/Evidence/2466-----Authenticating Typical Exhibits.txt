Authenticating Typical Exhibits 
At the most basic level, evidence must be established as reliable or authentic. Thus, evidence, 
other than testimonial evidence, must be properly authenticated; that is, the party offering the 
evidence must produce some evidence to show it is, in fact, what the party says it is. If a piece 
of real evidence cannot be authenticated, the evidence will not be admitted even if it is plainly 
relevant.  
 
For proper authentication, the party offering the evidence must produce some evidence (e.g., 
testimony from a person with first-hand knowledge) to show it is, in fact, what the party says 
it is and that it has remained in the same condition from the moment it was seized until it is 
used in court. 
 
Similar to the authentication requirement for tangible evidence, there is a similar sort of 
“credibility test” for witnesses. If testimony is to become admissible evidence, the witness 
must demonstrate that the knowledge being communicated is believable and gained by 
personal experience.  
 
Below are some of the issues you will encounter in proving to the judge that a particular 
exhibit is authentic.
