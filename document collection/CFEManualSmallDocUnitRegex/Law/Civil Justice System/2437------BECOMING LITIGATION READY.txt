BECOMING LITIGATION READY 
The recent amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure concerning the discovery of 
ESI are exposing companies to further liabilities and costs during litigation because they 
require organizations to adapt how they manage, retain, store, and deliver ESI during legal 
proceedings. The amendments provide that, in most circumstances, parties must voluntarily 
turn over (i.e., without awaiting a discovery request by the other party) a copy, or a 
description by category and location, of all ESI to the other party within 14 days of the pre-
 trial conference. Therefore, it is essential that parties (or organizations) be prepared for the 
advent of electronic discovery prior to a case being filed, or in other words, companies must 
be litigation ready. To be litigation ready, parties (or organizations) must know the scope of 
their ESI, the location of their ESI, the storage format of their ESI, the length of time ESI is 
stored, and whether their ESI is readily accessible.
