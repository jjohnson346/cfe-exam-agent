Prediscovery Disclosure  
FRCP 26(a) and similar state rules require parties to make prediscovery disclosures. These rules 
require parties to disclose certain information before formal discovery begins, such as the 
disclosure of witnesses’ identities, materials that may be used to support claims or defenses, 
computations of damages, and insurance agreements that may cover the claim. As amended 
in 2006, Rule 26(a) includes electronically stored information (ESI) in the list of items that 
litigants must provide in their prediscovery disclosures.
