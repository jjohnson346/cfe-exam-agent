Pre-trial Motions in Criminal Court 
Criminal trials, like civil proceedings, often begin with pre-trial motions. Some of these are 
the same regardless of the type of court (civil or criminal). For example, both criminal and 
civil defendants can make motions in limine  to exclude certain evidence, can ask that the charge 
or complaint be made more definite and certain, or can request a postponement of the trial 
date. Other motions are particular  to the criminal process.  
 
Some pre-trial motions typically used in criminal trials are discussed below.
