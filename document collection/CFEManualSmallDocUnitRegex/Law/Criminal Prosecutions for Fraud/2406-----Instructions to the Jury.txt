Instructions to the Jury 
After both parties have presented their closing arguments, the next step is for the judge to 
instruct the jury. In a jury trial, the judge presents a charge, or instructions, to the jury. Again, 
the instructions state the legal issues to be considered in a case, define any unusual terms, 
and tell the jury specifically what it must decide, reviewing the complaint or indictment 
count by count if necessary. A verdict charge form will state the decisive issues in a question-and-answer 
format; the jury uses the questions to focus their deliberation.
