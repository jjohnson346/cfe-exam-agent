Jury Deliberations 
After hearing instructions, the jury retires for its deliberations and selects a foreperson. 
Generally, the verdict must be unanimous. But in some states, such as Oregon and 
Louisiana, a jury can return a conviction with only 10 of 12 votes. If the jury is unable to 
reach a verdict, the judge will declare a mistrial. If there is a mistrial, the defendant can be 
retried if the prosecution elects to do so; double jeopardy does not attach unless the 
defendant is acquitted after the jury is sworn.
