VIOLATING THE DEFENDANT’S RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL 
The indictment may be dismissed for violations of a defendant’s right to a speedy trial, when 
the trial date exceeds a certain amount of time after the charge (usually 70 days). A related 
basis for the motion is alleging pre-indictment delay, when, for example, the prosecution 
took an excessively long time in bringing the indictment.
