DUPLICITY 
Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that each count of an 
indictment state one and only one offense. A count that charges two or more offenses is 
duplicitous. Unfortunately, what constitutes a single offense often is hard to determine with 
white-collar criminal statutes. Single and continuing offenses, committed for several 
objectives or by multiple means, like mail or wire fraud or conspiracy, may be charged in one 
count, although they alternatively could be charged as separate and distinct counts. 
Generally, however, if the separate violations are all a part of the same criminal scheme, they 
can be alleged in the same count. This is sometimes preferable for the defendant because if 
all of the violations are alleged in one count, it looks to the jury as if the defendant has 
committed one fraud rather than 50 separate frauds.
