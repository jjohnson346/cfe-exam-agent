Employee Polygraph Protection Act 
The Employee Polygraph Protection Act prohibits the use of polygraphs by most private 
employers unless the employer is engaged in an ongoing investigation involving economic 
loss or injury to the employer in the employer’s business, and has a reasonable suspicion that 
the employee is involved in the incident. Reasonable suspicion is an observable, articulated basis 
in fact; it is similar to predication.  
 
Employers subject to this Act cannot use polygraphs to screen applicants for employment, 
and they cannot discharge an employee for refusing to take a polygraph exam.  
 
The Employee Polygraph Protection Act, however, does not protect government employees.
