Obstruction of Justice  
To review, obstruction of justice statutes punish efforts to impede or obstruct the 
investigation or trial of other substantive offenses. There are several federal criminal statutes 
that prohibit obstruction of justice. Many are specific to a particular setting or industry, or to 
a particular kind of proceeding such as the prohibition against obstructing a federal audit (18 
U.S.C. § 1516) or obstructing the examination of a financial institution by a federal agency (18 U.S.C. § 1517).   
 
These statutes are contained in Chapter 73 of the U.S. Code and prohibit impeding, 
influencing, or obstructing virtually any type of federal proceeding (including criminal 
investigations) through the destruction of documents, threats, bribes, or witness tampering. 
for more information, see the Obstruction of Justice section in “The Law Related to Fraud 
(Part 2)” chapter above.
