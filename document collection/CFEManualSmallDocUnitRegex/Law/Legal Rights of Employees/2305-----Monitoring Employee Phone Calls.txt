Monitoring Employee Phone Calls 
To review, the Wiretap Act provisions of the ECPA limit an employer’s ability to monitor 
employee phone calls. In addition to the ECPA, a company’s right to monitor employee 
phone calls is also limited by employees’ constitutional and common law privacy rights, as 
discussed above. 
 
Although interception is generally forbidden under the Wiretap Act, employers may lawfully 
monitor phone calls if they fall under one of the statutory exceptions, including the ordinary 
course of business exception and the consent exception.
