Private Employers 
The Fifth Amendment generally does not apply to private employers because, in the absence 
of a state action, there is no constitutional protection against self-incrimination. Therefore, 
an employee might be subject to dismissal by a private company if he fails to cooperate in an 
investigation. However, there are situations, as discussed above, where private companies 
may be held liable for violating their employees’ constitutional rights. When there is a 
sufficient nexus between a regulated company and the government such that the private 
company essentially acts as an agent of the government, then that private company’s actions 
will be treated as actions of the government itself. In such a case, constitutional protections 
for the private company’s employees are triggered.  
 
The key to the determination is whether the private company is acting on behalf of the 
government as an agent of the government. For example, if a private entity were directed by the

police to interview its employees in connection with a crime, this entity would be acting as 
an agent of the police. In this situation, the private company’s employees could not be 
terminated for refusing to answer questions that might incriminate them.  
 
It should also be noted that some states have expanded the rights of private employees to 
include protections for certain constitutional rights. Thus, an interviewer should consult with 
an attorney before taking any adverse action against an employee who refuses to answer 
potentially incriminating questions.
