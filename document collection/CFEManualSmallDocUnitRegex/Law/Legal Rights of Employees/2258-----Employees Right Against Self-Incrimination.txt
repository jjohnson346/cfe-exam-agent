Employee’s Right Against Self-Incrimination 
The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that a person cannot be 
compelled to give information that may incriminate him in a criminal case. It provides:  
 
No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a 
presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or 
in the militia, when in actual service in time of war and public danger; nor shall any person be 
subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in 
any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, 
without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just 
compensation. 
 
The Fifth Amendment’s right against self-incrimination contains two basic protections: it 
protects a person from being forced to give information that could be used to convict him 
of a criminal offense, and it prevents the state from punishing an employee for his silence or 
otherwise using his exercise of that right against him.
