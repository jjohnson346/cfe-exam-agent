SEARCHES INCIDENT TO ARREST 
Police officers may, without a warrant, conduct a limited search incident to an a lawful arrest. 
Individual Rights During Examinations Law 
2.422  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
The search, however, must be limited to the arrestee’s body and the area within his 
immediate control. This exception is designed to protect the officers and to prevent the 
destruction of evidence. For the search to be valid, the arrest must be valid (i.e., based on 
probable cause, and not merely a pretext to justify a search). If the arrest is unlawful when 
made, it cannot be justified by the fruits of the subsequent search, and all evidence obtained 
must be suppressed.
