ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS EXCEPTION  
The ECPA’s definition of “electronic device” specifically excludes devices that are used by 
an employer in the “ordinary course of busi ness.” Therefore, employers are permitted to 
monitor their employees’ wire or electronic communications, including phone calls, if done 
for a legitimate business purpose.
