Federal and State Nondiscrimination Statutes  
Nondiscrimination statutes such as the federal Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1871, Title VII 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1970, as 
well as similar state statutes, protect employees from being singled out for searches on the 
basis of such characteristics as race, national origin, sex, religion, and age. These laws also 
protect employees against disparate discipline assessed as a result of a search.
