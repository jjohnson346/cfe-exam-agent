CONSTRUCTION WITH OTHER LAWS (18 U.S.C. § 1838) 
Section 1838 states that “[t]his chapter shall not be construed to preempt or displace any 
other remedies, whether civil or criminal, provided by United States Federal, State... or to 
affect the otherwise lawful disclosure of information by any government employees under 
section 552 of title 5 (commonly known as the Freedom of Information Act).” Therefore, 
the EEA does not bar the government from seeking any other remedies, whether civil or 
criminal.
