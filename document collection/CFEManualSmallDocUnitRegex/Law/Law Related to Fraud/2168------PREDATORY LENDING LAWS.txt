PREDATORY LENDING LAWS  
In the past five years, more than half the states in the United States have taken steps to limit 
predatory lending practices, and seven have placed a ban on prepayment penalties. Localities 
in some states have also passed ordinances dealing with predatory lending practices. 
 
Victims of predatory lending practices should contact their state Attorney General’s office. 
The U.S. Office of the Attorney General consolidates individual states’ actions against 
predatory lending practices. Two additional predatory lending resources are: 
• The National Association of Attorneys General (www.naag.org) 
• The Center for Responsible Lending ( www.responsiblelending.org)
