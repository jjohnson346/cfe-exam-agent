Embezzlement 
Embezzlement is the wrongful appropriation of money or property by a person to whom it has 
been lawfully entrusted (or to whom lawful possession was given). Embezzlement involves a 
breach of trust, although it is not necessary to show a fiduciary relationship between the 
parties. The elements of embezzlement are generally: 
• The defendant took or converted 
• Without the knowledge or consent of the owner 
• Money or property of another 
• That was entrusted to the defendant (defendant had lawful possession of the property)
