Forgery 
Forgery includes two distinct common law offenses: forgery and uttering a forged 
instrument. Both crimes are specific intent offenses, i.e., they both require proof of specific 
intent to defraud. 
 
Forgery is: 
• The fraudulent making or altering 
• Of a false writing or instrument that has apparent legal significance 
• With the intent to defraud 
 
Uttering a forged instrument expands the forgery offense by including the offering or 
passing of a forged document as genuine. The elements of uttering a forged instrument are: 
• Offering as genuine 
• A forged instrument 
• With the intent to defraud 
 
A forgery occurs when a document is not what it purports to be. It is not forgery just 
because the writing contains a false representation. The writing as a whole must have 
apparent legal significance. Forgery occurs not just when an entire writing or instrument is 
created, but also when there is any material alteration that affects the legal significance of the

document and/or whenever a signature on a writing is fraudulently procured from a person 
who does not know what he is signing. Furthermore, the offense is committed even if no 
one is actually defrauded. 
 
Although forgery is a crime, not a civil wrong, it can occur in connection with a fraud or a 
conversion of property or property interests, for which the victim can seek civil remedies.
