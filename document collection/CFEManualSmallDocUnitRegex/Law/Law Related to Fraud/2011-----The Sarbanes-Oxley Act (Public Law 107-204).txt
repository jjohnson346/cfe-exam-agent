The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Public Law 107-204) 
On July 30, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This law, which 
was triggered in large part by several corporate accounting scandals that occurred in 2001 
and 2002, significantly changed the laws of corporate governance and the rules and 
regulations under which accounting firms must operate. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was 
designed to restore investor confidence in capital markets and help eliminate financial 
statement fraud in publicly traded companies while at the same time significantly increasing 
the penalties for corporate accounting fraud. The most significant changes brought on by 
the Act included:  
• The creation of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
• Requirements for senior financial officers to certify SEC filings 
• New standards for audit committee independence 
• New standards for auditor independence 
• Enhanced financial disclosure requirements 
• New protections for corporate whistleblowers 
• Enhanced penalties for white-collar crime
