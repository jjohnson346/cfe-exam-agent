STATE REGULATION  
New mortgage lenders that are non-depository are regulated by the state of their charter. 
State-chartered mortgage lenders are exempt from federal regulation, and regulation varies 
from state to state. In 1993, only 18 states directly regulated their mortgage lending industry;

however, today, all 50 states have statutes directly regulating the mortgage-lending industry 
in some capacity. 
 
Until recently, there were no national standards for the licensing and oversight of mortgage 
brokers. But on July 30, 2008, President Bush signed into law the Secure and Fair 
Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act), which is part of the Housing 
and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. Designed to provide uniform licensing standards 
nationwide, the SAFE Act requires all states to have in place a system of licensure meeting 
minimum standards for mortgage loan originators (i.e., anyone who takes a residential 
mortgage loan application or who offers or negotiates terms of a residential mortgage loan 
application for compensation or gain) by July 31, 2009.  
 
At a minimum, the state’s licensing system must meet all of the following requirements: 
• Screen individuals for felonies in the last seven years 
• Screen individuals for previous license revocations 
• Require proof of financial responsibility using a credit report 
• Require pre-license testing and education 
• Require continuing education 
• Provide for license renewals on an annual basis 
• Include a bond, net worth, or recovery fund
