THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT  
Although Congress originally enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA) to protect health insurance coverage for workers and their families, it 
expanded the law to protect patient health information. The HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to 
health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses that electronically transmit 
health information in connection with a covered transaction, and it governs access to and 
use of “protected health information,” which includes any identifiable information that 
relates to a patient’s health, health care, or payment for health care. 
 
The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally provides that covered entities cannot use or disclose any 
protected health information except as authorized by the subject of that information or as 
specifically required or authorized by the regulations. It also provides that when the use or 
disclosure of such information is permitted, covered entities must make all reasonable efforts 
to use or disclose the minimum amount of protected information necessary to accomplish 
the intended purpose.  
 
If protected health information becomes an issue during a fraud examination, the examiner 
should immediately contact the human resources (HR) department. The HR department 
should have information about whether the entity is subject to HIPAA rules and can help 
the examiner comply with those rules.  
 
The most important thing to note is that if HIPAA rules do apply, examiners are restricted 
as to the type of health information they can access without specific written authorization. 
Examiners should never contact the health care provider, the health-plan administrator, or a 
medical-billing service for copies of employee’s records without first consulting the 
employer’s legal counsel or HR department.
