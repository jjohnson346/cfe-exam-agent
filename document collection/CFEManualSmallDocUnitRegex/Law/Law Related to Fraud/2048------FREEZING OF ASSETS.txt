FREEZING OF ASSETS 
During an investigation of possible securities violations by a publicly traded company or any 
of its officers, directors, partners, agents, controlling persons, or employees, the SEC can 
petition a federal court to issue a 45-day freeze on “extraordinary payments” to any of the 
foregoing persons. If granted, the payments will be placed in an interest-bearing escrow 
account while the investigation commences. This provision was enacted to prevent 
corporate assets from being improperly distributed while an investigation is underway.
