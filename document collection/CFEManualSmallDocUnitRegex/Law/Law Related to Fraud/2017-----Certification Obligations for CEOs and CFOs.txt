Certification Obligations for CEOs and CFOs 
One of the most significant changes affected by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is the requirement 
that the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of public 
companies personally certify annual and quarterly SEC filings. These certifications essentially 
require CEOs and CFOs to take responsibility for their companies’ financial statements and 
prevent them from delegating this responsibility to their subordinates and then claiming 
ignorance when fraud is uncovered in the financial statements.  
 
There are two types of officer certifications mandated by Sarbanes-Oxley: criminal 
certifications, which are set forth in Sarbanes-Oxley section 906 and codified at 18 U.S.C. § 
1350, and civil certifications, which are set forth in Sarbanes-Oxley section 302.
