Extortion 
An extortion case is often the flip side of a bribery case. Extortion is defined as the obtaining 
of property from another with the other party’s “consent” having been induced by wrongful 
use of actual or threatened force or fear. Fear might include the apprehension of possible 
economic damage or loss. A demand for a bribe or kickback, coupled with a threat of 
adverse action if the payment is not paid, also might constitute extortion. 
 
In most states and the federal system, extortion is not a defense to bribery. That is, a person 
who makes a bribe payment upon demand of the recipient still is culpable for bribery. In 
New York, however, extortion may be a defense in certain circumstances.
