Program Fraud Civil Remedies (31 U.S.C. §§ 3801-3812) 
These provisions provide for agency administrative adjudication of relatively small false 
claims (less than $150,000) and for which the agency has approval to prosecute from the 
Department of Justice. The purpose of the fraud civil remedy is to provide the agency with 
the ability to prosecute those cases that would otherwise not be prosecuted in the courts 
because of the cost of a civil court action and relatively low potential recovery.
