Laws Relating to Government Contracting 
Government contracting refers to the acquisition of goods or services by the federal 
government at the best possible value. Since the primary objective of an effective 
procurement policy is achieving the best value of money, it is important that the 
procurement process avoid incidences of fraud. 
 
The U.S. legal system provides for both private and public remedies for procurement fraud. 
Fraudulent conduct related to the procurement process may be challenged by federal 
prosecutors, state prosecutors, or private parties who have been injured by the fraudulent 
conduct and have standing to sue.  
 
This section examines relevant statutes used to prosecute contract fraud and applicable civil 
remedies used to recover damages for fraudulent activity. The following federal statutes may 
be used to combat contracting fraud:  
• False Claims and Statements  
• Mail Fraud and Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343) 
• Bribery, Gratuities, and Conflicts of Interest, Generally (18 U.S.C. §§ 201–208) 
• Anti-Kickback Act of 1986 (41 U.S.C. §§ 51–58) 
• Procurement Integrity Act (41 U.S.C. § 423)  
• The Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 (15 U.S.C. §§ 12–27, 52–53)  
• Truth in Negotiations Act (10 U.S.C. § 2306) 
• Federal Acquisition Regulation
