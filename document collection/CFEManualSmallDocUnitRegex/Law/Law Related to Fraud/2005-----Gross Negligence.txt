Gross Negligence 
Gross negligence can be generally defined as the intentional failure to perform a duty in reckless 
disregard of the consequences to the victim. Although the exact definition varies by state, 
the basic elements of this civil cause of action are that the defendant committed an 
intentional act, knowing that it was at least substantially likely to cause harm to the victim. In 
regards to an employee, the employee has a duty to act in the best interests of the employer. 
If the employee consciously steals from the employer, the employee has breached that duty 
and caused harm to the employer; further, the employee knew that the harm would occur 
when he committed the act. One further note about gross negligence — generally, punitive or 
exemplary damages are available if the defendant is found liable.
