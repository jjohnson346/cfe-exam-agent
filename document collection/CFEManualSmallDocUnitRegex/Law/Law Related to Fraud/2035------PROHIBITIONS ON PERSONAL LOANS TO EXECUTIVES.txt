PROHIBITIONS ON PERSONAL LOANS TO EXECUTIVES 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 402 makes it illegal for public companies to make personal loans or 
otherwise extend credit, either directly or indirectly, to or for any director or executive 
officer. An exception applies to consumer lenders if the loans are consumer loans of the type 
the company normally makes to the public and are on the same terms.
