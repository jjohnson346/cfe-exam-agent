BOOKS AND RECORDS (RECORD-KEEPING) PROVISION  
The first major requirement of the accounting provisions is that all issuers must accurately 
record all transactions, keep receipts and other support for transactions, and keep records in 
a manner consistent with overall document retention and record-keeping policies. 
 
In practice, the books and records provisions are used to prevent three types of 
improprieties:  
• The failure to record improper transactions 
• The falsification of records to conceal improper transactions 
• The creation of records that are quantitatively correct, but fail to specify the qualitative 
aspects of a transaction that might reveal the true purpose of a particular payment
