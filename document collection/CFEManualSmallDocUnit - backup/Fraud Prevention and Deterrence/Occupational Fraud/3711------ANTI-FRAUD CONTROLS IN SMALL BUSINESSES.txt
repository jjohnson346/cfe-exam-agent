ANTI-FRAUD CONTROLS IN SMALL BUSINESSES  
We have long hypothesized that many small companies are particularly susceptible to fraud, 
at least partially due to the limited resources they devote to anti-fraud controls. To test this 
theory, we compared the presence of anti-fraud controls at those companies with fewer than 
100 employees to the controls at companies with more than 100 employees. Our findings 
confirm what we suspected: The small companies in our study did indeed have fewer 
controls in place than the larger organizations — a factor that may contribute to the 
disproportionate impact of fraud on these companies. While discrepancies in levels of 
certain controls are somewhat expected given the associated costs or resources required to 
enact them, the gap between controls in small businesses as opposed to larger organizations 
is striking. For example, it would be expected that small businesses would have a lower rate 
of external audits and that fewer small companies would have a formal internal audit or 
                                                 
48The sum of percentages in this chart exceeds 100% because many victim  organizations had more than one 
anti-fraud control in place at the time of the fraud.

fraud examination function. But even less expensive controls were often absent in small 
businesses. While 64% of large companies had so me sort of management review of controls, 
processes, accounts, or transactions, less than half as many small businesses had the same 
type of monitoring in place. Likewise, formal codes of conduct and anti-fraud policies cost 
very little to implement, but serve as an effective way to make a clear and explicit statement 
against fraudulent and unethical conduct within an organization. Yet only 41% and 16% of 
small businesses had these policies (respectively) in place when the fraud occurred —
numbers dwarfed by the 83% and 50 % rates of larger organizations. 
 
Perhaps most concerning is that only 15% of small businesses had a hotline in place, 
compared to 64% of larger organizations. As previously discussed, our research shows that 
hotlines are consistently the most effective fraud detection method. Further, the median loss 
for frauds at companies with hotlines was 59% smaller than the median loss for frauds at 
organizations without such a mechanism. Arguably, enacting hotlines would go a long way in 
helping small-business owners protect their assets from dishonest employees.
