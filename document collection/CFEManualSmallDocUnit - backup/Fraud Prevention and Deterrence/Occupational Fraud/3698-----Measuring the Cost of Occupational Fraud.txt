Measuring the Cost of Occupational Fraud 
Measuring the cost of occupational fraud is an important, yet incredibly challenging, 
endeavor. Arguably, the true cost is incalculable. The inherently clandestine nature of fraud 
means that many cases will never be revealed, and, of those that are, the full amount of 
losses might not be uncovered, quantified, or reported. Consequently, any measurement of 
occupational fraud costs will be, at best, an estimate. Nonetheless, determining such an 
approximation is critical to illustrate the pandemic and destructive nature of white-collar 
crime.  
 
We asked each CFE who participated in our survey to provide his best estimate of the 
percentage of annual revenues that the typical organization loses to fraud in a given year.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    4.621  
The median response was that the average organization annually loses 5% of its revenues to 
fraud. Applying this percentage to the 2009 estimated Gross World Product of $58.07 
trillion would result in a projected total global fraud loss of more than $2.9 trillion. 
 
Note that this estimate is based solely on the opinions of 1,843 anti-fraud experts, rather 
than any specific data or factual observations; accordingly, it should not be interpreted as a 
literal representation of the worldwide cost of occupational fraud. However, because there is 
no way to precisely calculate the size of global fraud losses, the best estimate of anti-fraud 
professionals with a frontline view of the problem may be as reliable a measure as we are 
able to make. In any event, it is undeniable that the overall cost of occupational fraud is 
immense, certainly costing organizations hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars each year.
