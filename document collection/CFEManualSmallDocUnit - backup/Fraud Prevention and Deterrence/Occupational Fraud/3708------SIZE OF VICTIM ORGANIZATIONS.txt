SIZE OF VICTIM ORGANIZATIONS 
Continuing the trend observed in our prior studies, small organizations — those with fewer 
than 100 employees — suffered the greatest percentage of the frauds in our 2010 study, 
accounting for more than 30% of the victim organizations. However, the variation between 
size categories is relatively small, with 23% of victims having between 100 and 999 
employees, 26% having 1,000 to 9,999 employees, and 21% having more than 10,000 
employees. 
 
This relatively small disparity contrasts with our previous studies, in which small 
organizations were involved in a much higher percent of frauds than any other category. 
Additionally, our research has historically shown that smaller organizations suffer 
disproportionately large losses due to occupational fraud. Organizations with fewer than 100 
employees experienced the greatest median loss of all categories of victim organizations in 
our 2008 study. The same was true in our 2006 study.
