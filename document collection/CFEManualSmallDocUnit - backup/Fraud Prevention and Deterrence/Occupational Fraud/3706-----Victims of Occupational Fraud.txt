Victims of Occupational Fraud 
As part of our survey, we asked each respondent to provide demographic information about 
the organization that was defrauded. We believe it is useful to measure the different ways in 
which occupational fraud impacts different types of organizations. Our hope is that this 
analysis may enable organizations to better identify where to strengthen or focus their anti-
 fraud efforts based on the experiences of other similar organizations.
