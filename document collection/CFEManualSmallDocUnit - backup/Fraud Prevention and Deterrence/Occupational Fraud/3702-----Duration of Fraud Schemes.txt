Duration of Fraud Schemes  
In addition to examining the monetary cost of the fraud cases reported to us, we analyzed 
the length of time these schemes lasted before being detected. The median duration—the 
time period from when the fraud first occurred to when it was discovered — for all cases in 
our study was 18 months. Not surprisingly, cases involving financial statement fraud—the 
most costly form of fraud—lasted the long est, with a median duration of 27 months. 
Fraudulent register disbursements, on the other hand, were not only the least costly form of 
fraud in our study, but also tended to be detected the soonest. 
                                                 
44The sum of percentages in this chart exceeds 100% becausese veral cases involved schemes from more than 
one category.
