PERPETRATOR’S POSITION 
We asked survey respondents whether the perpetrator was an employee, a manager, or an 
owner/executive. Below we see that the distribution of cases based on the perpetrator’s 
position was fairly similar to what we found in our 2008 study, although the 2010 
distribution was slightly more skewed toward employees and managers. Not surprisingly, 
there was a strong correlation between the perpetrator’s position of authority and the losses 
caused by fraud. The median loss in owner/executive frauds was more than three times the 
loss caused by managers, and more than nine times higher than losses in employee fraud 
cases.
