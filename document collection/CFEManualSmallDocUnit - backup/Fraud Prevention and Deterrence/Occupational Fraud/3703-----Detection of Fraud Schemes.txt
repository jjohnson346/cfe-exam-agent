Detection of Fraud Schemes 
One of the principal goals of our research is to identify how past frauds were detected so 
that organizations can apply that knowledge to their future anti-fraud efforts. Tips were by 
far the most common detection method in our study, catching nearly three times as many 
frauds as any other form of detection. This is consistent with the findings in our prior 
reports. Tips have been far and away the most common means of detection in every study 
since 2002, when we began tracking the data.  
 
Management review and internal audit were the second and third most common forms of 
detection, uncovering 15% and 14% of frauds, re spectively. It is also noteworthy that 11% 
of frauds were detected through channels that lie completely outside of the traditional anti-
 fraud control structure: accident, police notificat ion, and confession. In other words, 11% of 
the time, the victim organization either had to stumble onto the fraud or be notified of it by 
a third party in order to detect it.
