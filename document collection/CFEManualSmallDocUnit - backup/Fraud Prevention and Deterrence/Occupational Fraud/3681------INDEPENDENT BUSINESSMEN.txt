INDEPENDENT BUSINESSMEN 
The independent businessmen in Cressey’s study were people who were in business for 
themselves and who converted “deposits” that had been entrusted to them. 11 Perpetrators in 
this category tended to use one of two common excuses: (1) they were “borrowing” the 
money they converted or (2) the funds entrusted to them were really theirs—you can’t steal 
from yourself. Cressey found the “borrowing” rationalization was the one most frequently 
used. These perpetrators also tended to espouse the idea that “everyone” in business 
misdirects deposits in some way, which therefore made their own misconduct less wrong 
than “stealing.” 12 Also, the independent businessmen almost universally felt their illegal 
actions were predicated by an “unusual situati on,” which Cressey concluded was in reality a 
non-shareable financial problem.
