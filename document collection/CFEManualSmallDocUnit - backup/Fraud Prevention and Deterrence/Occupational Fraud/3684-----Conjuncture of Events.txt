Conjuncture of Events 
Perhaps the most important conclusion to be drawn from the Cressey study was that it took 
all three elements — perceived non-shareable fi nancial problem, perceived opportunity, and 
the ability to rationalize — for the trust violation to occur.  
  
“The three events make up the conditions under which trust violation occurs and the term 
cause may be applied to their conjuncture since trust violation is dependent on that 
conjuncture. Whenever the conjunc ture of events occurs, trust violation results, and if the 
conjuncture does not take place there is no trust violation.” 23
