Prosecuting Organizational Fraud 
In response to the high-profile corporate frauds of Enron, WorldCom, Global Crossing, and 
others, the Department of Justice (DOJ) instituted policies for imposing criminal penalties 
against business organizations. In January 2003, then Deputy Attorney General Larry 
Thompson issued a DOJ memorandum entitled “Principles of Federal Prosecution of 
Business Organization” (the Thompson Memorandum).  
 
The Thompson Memorandum explained the Depart ment’s position regarding the factors it 
considered in choosing to prosecute corporations and under what conditions an 
organization may reduce liability for cooperating with the government. One of the factors 
prosecutors considered in reaching their charging decisions was a company’s willingness to 
cooperate in the investigation. The Thompson Memorandum provided that in assessing a 
company’s cooperation, prosecutors were to consider whether the company waived its 
attorney-client privileges and attorney work product protections. The Thompson 
Memorandum also made clear that businesses perceived as not having fully cooperated 
would more likely face criminal indictment, prosecution, and sanctions. 
 
Following its issuance, many criticized the Thompson Memorandum because it seemed to 
imply that companies that refused to turn over privileged documents to the government 
could be considered uncooperative. In an attempt to appease critics, then Deputy Attorney 
General Paul McNulty issued a revised memo (the McNulty Memorandum) for federal 
investigation and prosecution of business organizations. The McNulty Memorandum revised 
the DOJ’s prior guidance outlined in the Thompson Memorandum that addressed the 
practice of federal prosecutors seeking waiver as an element of a company’s cooperation. 
The McNulty Memorandum provided specific criteria prosecutors were required to consider 
and procedures they were required to follow before seeking waiver of privileges or work 
product protection.

On August 28, 2008, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued guidelines that revised the 
McNulty Memorandum on how federal prosecutors investigate, charge, and prosecute 
corporate crimes. Unlike the McNulty and Thompson Memorandums, these guidelines are a 
part of the U.S. attorney’s manual, which provides internal DOJ guidance but does not 
create any enforceable law. 
 
In an effort to stop congressional action, the guidelines bar prosecutors from judging 
corporate cooperation for leniency on whether an entity is willing to waive the attorney-client 
privilege or work product protection. The guidelines also state that prosecutors can no 
longer seek disclosure of information that is either privileged or protected work product. In 
addition, the guidelines provide that when evaluating a corporation’s cooperation, 
prosecutors may no longer consider whether a company is advancing legal fees for its 
employees, whether a corporation has sanctioned or retained culpable employees, or whether 
a corporation has entered into joint defense agreements.  
 
Even though most observers agree that the guidelines are a significant improvement over the 
McNulty Memorandum, many contend that comprehensive legislation is still needed to 
make the DOJ’s reforms permanent and prevent a relapse in department policy, and to bar 
similar waiver policies adopted by other federal agencies, such as the Securities Exchange 
Commission and the Internal Revenue Service.
