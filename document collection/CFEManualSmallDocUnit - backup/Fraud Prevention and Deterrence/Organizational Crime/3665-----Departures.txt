Departures 
Courts are permitted to impose fines outside the range prescribed by the Guidelines if there 
are special aggravating or mitigating circumstances in the case that would make a fine within 
the range inappropriate. Sentences that fall outside the guideline range are known as 
departures. The Guidelines describe certain factors that would justify departures from the 
ordinary fine range, although the lists are not exhaustive.
