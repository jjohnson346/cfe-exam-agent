Public Information 
It is tempting to consider confidential information to be “nonpublic information” instead of 
“all information” on the grounds that public information is available to everyone anyway. 
Such an interpretation is not appropriate. Public information might be hard to find and/or 
expensive to obtain and analyze. After all, the client or company paid the Certified Fraud 
Examiner a fee or salary to find and use public information, and a Certified Fraud 
Examiner’s disclosure of it would give others a “free ride.” When information is public, let 
others find it for themselves.  
 
Some might argue that no confidence is abused if a Certified Fraud Examiner points others 
to public information that is published and widely distributed, such as financial statements in 
annual reports or stories in national newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal. The next step 
is to consider public information that is not published, such as real estate deed restrictions, 
liens on property, and credit records. Defending a breach of confidence on the grounds “It 
was public anyway” is a weak excuse. Mere revelation of the source of information imparts 
signals of importance that are not public and that may guide others to information a client or 
employer believes is confidential.
