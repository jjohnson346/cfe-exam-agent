Conflicts of Interest 
This generally refers to a clash between public or corporate interest and the private 
pecuniary interest of an individual or individuals. It arises when an officer’s or employee’s 
personal or financial interest conflicts or appears to conflict with his official duties. 
 
Any indication that there may be a conflict of interest or that there appears to be a conflict 
of interest should be reviewed/investigated. This is particularly important if the 
agency/company does not require employees to sign conflict of interest statements annually, 
and there is no active prevention program such as a computer cross check of employee 
phone numbers and addresses with those of contractors and vendors.
