False Imprisonment 
False imprisonment can mean more than putting a person behind bars. Courts have found 
many means of detainment to be false imprisonment, including locking an employee in a 
store, removing a distributor from a car, and detaining a witness by force. Even though 
drastic action might be essential, a fraud examiner must accomplish his task legally.
