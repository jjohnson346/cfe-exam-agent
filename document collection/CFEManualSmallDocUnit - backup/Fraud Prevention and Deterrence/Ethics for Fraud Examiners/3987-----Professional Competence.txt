Professional Competence 
Professional competence refers to how well Certified Fraud Examiners do their job. 
Determination of competence always depends on the specific facts and circumstances of the 
assignment. Competence is best understood in the context of the prudent practitioner. The idea 
of a prudent professional practitioner is present in other social science theories, for example, 
the “economic man” of economic theory and the “reasonable man” of law. This concept can 
be summarized for fraud examiners as follows:  
 
A prudent practitioner is assumed to have a knowledge of the philosophy and practice of 
fraud examinations, to have the degree of tr aining, experience, and skill common to the 
average fraud examiner, to have the ability to recognize indications of frauds, and to keep 
abreast of developments in the perpetration and detection of fraud. Competence requires the 
CFE to be acquainted with the company, activity, function, or program under 
investigation; to review the methods of control in operation; to obtain  sufficient evidence 
pertinent to the suspected fraud or illegal acti vity; to be responsive to unusual events and 
unfamiliar circumstances; to persist until any reasonable doubts about the evidence have 
been eliminated; and to exercise caution in instructing assistants and reviewing their work.

Professional competence also demands attention to three kinds of interference that can 
damage the independence and quality of a Certified Fraud Examiner’s work. Fraud 
examiners who permit these conditions to interfere with the assignment demonstrate less 
than the desired level of professional competence. The three types of interference are 
programming, investigation, and reporting.
