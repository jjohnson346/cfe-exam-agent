Relation to Conflict of Interest 
Another aspect of the confidentiality rule concerns the possibility that a fraud examiner 
might use information that is part of a conflict of interest with the client/employer. The 
Institute of Internal Auditors’ Code of Ethics c ontains language that makes this relation very 
clear: “Members and Certified Internal Auditors shall be prudent in the use of information 
acquired in the course of their duties. They shall not use confidential information for any 
personal gain nor in any manner which would be contrary to law or detrimental to the 
welfare of their organization.” Clearly, using information for personal gain or using 
information to the detriment of the client/employer is a close kin to lying and stealing. The 
lie comes from the Certified Fraud Examiner’s breaking a pledge to maintain confidentiality, 
and the stealing comes from harming the client or employer.  
 
When a Certified Fraud Examiner faces the potential for personal gain from confidential 
client information, a conflict of interest exists—the Certified Fraud Examiner’s desire for 
wealth vs. the client/employer’s desire for and trust in confidential services. One of the 
worst kinds of ethical breaches would be to break the promise of confidentiality for personal 
gain. It is mere greed at work.
