Assemble the Right Team to Lead and Conduct the Fraud Risk Assessment  
Before conducting the fraud risk assessment, the organization should build a fraud  
risk assessment team consisting of individuals with diverse knowledge, skills, and 
perspectives that will lead and conduct the fraud risk assessment. The size of the team will 
depend on the size of the organization and the methods used to conduct the assessment. 
The team should have individuals who are credible and who have experience in gathering 
and eliciting information.  
 
The team members might include internal and external resources, such as: 
• Accounting and finance personnel who are familiar with the financial reporting 
processes and internal controls 
• Non-financial business unit and operations personnel who have knowledge of day-to-day 
operations, customer and vendor interactions, and issues within the industry 
• Risk management personnel who can ensure that the fraud risk assessment process 
integrates with the organization’s enterprise risk management program 
• The general counsel or other members of the legal department 
• Members of any ethics or compliance functions within the organization 
• Internal auditors 
• External consultants with fraud and risk expertise 
• Any business leader with direct accountability for the effectiveness of the organization’s 
fraud risk management efforts
