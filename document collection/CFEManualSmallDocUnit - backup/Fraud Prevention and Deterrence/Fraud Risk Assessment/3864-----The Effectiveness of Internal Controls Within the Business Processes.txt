The Effectiveness of Internal Controls Within the Business Processes  
A good system of internal controls, with the right balance of preventive and detective 
controls, can greatly reduce an organization’s vulnerability to fraud. Preventive controls  are those 
manual or automated processes that stop something bad from happening before it occurs. 
Detective controls  can also be manual or automated, but are designed to identify something bad 
that has already occurred. No system of internal controls can fully eliminate the risk of fraud, 
but well-designed and effective internal controls can deter the average fraudster by reducing 
the opportunity to commit the fraud.
