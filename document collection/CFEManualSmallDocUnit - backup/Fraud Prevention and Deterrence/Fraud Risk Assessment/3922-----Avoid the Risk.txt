Avoid the Risk  
Management may decide to avoid the risk by eliminating an asset or exiting an activity if the 
control measures required to protect the organization against an identified threat are too 
expensive. This approach requires the fraud risk assessment team to complete a cost-benefit 
analysis of the value of the asset or activity to the organization compared to the cost of 
implementing measures to protect the asset or activity.
