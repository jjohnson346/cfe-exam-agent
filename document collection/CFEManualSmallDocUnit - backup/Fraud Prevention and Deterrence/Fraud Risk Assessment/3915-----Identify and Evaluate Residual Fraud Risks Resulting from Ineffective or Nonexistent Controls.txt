Identify and Evaluate Residual Fraud Risks Resulting from Ineffective or Nonexistent Controls  
Consideration of the internal control structure may reveal certain residual fraud risks, 
including management’s override of established controls that has not been adequately 
mitigated due to: 
• Lack of appropriate prevention and detection controls 
• Noncompliance with established prevention and control measures 
 
These residual fraud risks should be evaluated by the fraud risk assessment team in the 
development of the fraud risk response for likelihood and significance of occurrence.
