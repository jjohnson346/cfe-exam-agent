Fraud Risk Assessment


:


Keep It Alive and Relevant  
Since there are so many factors that can affect an organization’s vulnerability to fraud risk, 
management must ensure that the fraud risk assessment stays current and relevant. Someone 
should be designated within the organization to own the fraud risk assessment process. That 
person or team should build processes to ensure that all changes in the business model, 
company operating environment, and personnel are considered relative to their impact on 
the company’s risk of fraud.
