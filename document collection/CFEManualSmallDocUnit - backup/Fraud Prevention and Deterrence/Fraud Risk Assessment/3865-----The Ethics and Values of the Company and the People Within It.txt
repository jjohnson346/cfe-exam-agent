The Ethics and Values of the Company and the People Within It  
It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have a company made up of individuals whose 
ethics and values are fully aligned with those of the organization. The gap in that alignment 
can significantly increase an organization’s fraud risk.  
 
While many organizations have codes of conduct, those codes are not always very clear in 
drawing the definitive line between acceptable and unacceptable behavior. That lack of 
clarity leaves a lot of wiggle room for fraudsters to rationalize their actions. For example, in 
most organizations, it is generally understood that manipulating financial records is 
unacceptable behavior that will result in termination. However, it is not always apparent 
whether taking a pen or pencil home that belongs to the company is unacceptable behavior, 
or what the consequence, if any, would be.  
 
An organization that is clear and consistent about its ethics, values, and expectations for its 
people will reduce the potential fraudster’s ability to rationalize his actions. Likewise, an

organization that demonstrates consistency and predictability in how it handles and holds 
accountable unacceptable behaviors can significantly reduce the risk of fraud.
