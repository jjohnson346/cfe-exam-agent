Routine Activities Theory 
Routine activities theory, a variation of classical theory, holds that both the motivation to 
commit crime and the supply of offenders is constant. There will always be a certain number 
of people, motivated by greed, lust, and other forces, who incline toward lawbreaking. The 
determining factor, particularly in predatory crimes such as those involving violence and

theft, are the activities of potential victims. There are three important elements that  
influence crime: 
• The availability of suitable targets, such as companies and individuals 
• The absence of capable guardians, such as auditors and security personnel 
• The presence of motivated offenders, such as unhappy or financially  
challenged employees
