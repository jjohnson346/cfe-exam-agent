Why People Obey the Law 
Now that we have a general understanding of at least some of the reasons why humans 
behave the way they do, let us turn our discussion to why people obey (and contrarily break) 
the law. In his book Why People Obey the Law, Tom Tyler studies the two principal types of 
law-abiding people. 
 
Obviously, some people choose to obey the la w while others choose to break it. Many 
otherwise law-abiding members of society evade taxes, occasionally use a controlled 
substance, commit fraud, or even drive under the influence of alcohol. According to studies 
by Tyler, the instrumental and the normative perspectives attempt to explain why some 
follow the law to the letter while others obey selectively.
