Social Learning Theories 
Social learning theories  hold that criminal behavior is a function of the way people absorb 
information, viewpoints, and motivations from others, most notably from those with whom 
they are close, such as members of their peer group. Social learning theorists believe that all 
people have the potential to commit crime if they are exposed to certain kinds of 
circumstances. All people raised in France by French parents learn to speak that language; 
Poles learn to speak Polish. So too will a person raised with attitudes that favor criminal acts 
respond by committing such acts, and the person raised and living in an environment where 
criminal activity would be unthinkable will avoid crime;  indeed, crime might not even occur 
to him as a solution to whatever problem is confronting him.
