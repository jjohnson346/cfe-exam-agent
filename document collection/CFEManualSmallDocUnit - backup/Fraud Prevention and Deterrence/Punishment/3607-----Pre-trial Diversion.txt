Pre-trial Diversion 
While not truly a sentence since it is not the consequence of a trial or a plea, diversion is 
often used at the local level for offenders who seem suited to what it has to offer. Under its 
terms, selected individuals will be placed into some form of treatment program after they 
have been arrested but before further proceedings. If it is assumed, for instance, that their 
troubles with the criminal law were fundamentally related to alcoholism, they may be 
ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings a certain number of times each week for 
a specified period. Other offenders, particularly  juveniles, might be diverted to different 
kinds of counseling programs or placed in a remedial education group. Referrals to 
employment services might also be mandated. 
 
In theory, a person can be placed in a pre-trial diversion program almost indefinitely, though 
most judges will stipulate a time period. If the person successfully completes the program, a 
criminal record can be avoided. If the accused person fails in the diversion program, usually 
by nonparticipation, he can be tried for the crime that had earlier been charged against him. 
In practice, some judges demonstrate seemingly endless patience with such offenders, since 
they had originally determined that, given the situation, they did not want to imprison the 
alleged offender.
