Rehabilitation 
Intense debate in the area of corrections has centered about the question of whether prison 
and other programs can rehabilitate those exposed to them. A famous study by Robert 
Martinson reviewed more than 200 carefully designed research studies of diverse kinds of 
treatment programs for offenders and concluded that none of them showed much, if any, 
ability to turn persons away from a life of crime.6 More recently, some scholars now 
maintain that Martinson’s research was flawed and that his conclusion was inaccurate. They 
                                                 
6Robert Martinson, “What Works? — Questions and Answers About Prison Reform,” Public Interest, 35 
(1974):22-54.

stress in particular that the error has been to look for improvement in all those who undergo 
one or another kind of treatment regimen; instead, the effort should be to determine what 
works for what kinds of people and to concentrate on these conclusions when formulating 
treatment approaches.7  
 
Certainly, some white-collar offenders have used the incarceration experience to redesign 
their lives, in a manner very much for the better. Charles W. Colson, a onetime special 
assistant to President Nixon, was described by Herbert Klein, Nixon’s intimate friend, as 
“one of the meanest people I ever knew.” Caught up in the Watergate scandal, Colson 
negotiated a guilty plea to one count of obstruction of justice in regard to his involvement in 
the burglary of the office of Daniel Ellsberg in an effort to defame Ellsberg, who had 
released the Pentagon Papers, which showed the falsity of government claims about the 
progress of the Vietnam War. Colson received a one-to-three year prison sentence and was 
fined $5,000. 
 
During his time as an inmate at the Max well federal prison, Colson formed the Prison 
Fellowship, which sought to change the lives of convicts through a combination of 
“practical assistance and relentless evangelism.” 8 So successful was Colson that two decades 
after his release he was awarded the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, a prize that 
carried a stipend of more than $l million. “Twenty years later I see how God has used my 
life,” Colson noted when receiving the award. “Sometimes the greatest adversities turn out 
to be the greatest blessings.” 
 
Not all white-collar offenders demonstrate so extraordinary a turnabout, but cynics are wont 
to say that if one of the problems involved in maintaining control in America’s turbulent 
prison system has its basis in the lifestyles of many offenders, a “better class of prisoners”— 
that is, more white-collar offenders—mi ght help solve part of that problem.
