Corrections 
Corrections  is one of those euphemistic words that increasingly are entering the language in 
order to soften the reality of a situation. Corrections  is the general term for the process of 
administering punishment following a plea or a conviction in regard to a criminal offense. It 
most typically refers to imprisonment. People serve time in prisons most generally for 
felonies, while jails house individuals convicted of misdemeanors or those awaiting trial who 
have been unable or are not permitted to raise bail to purchase some free time. Generally, 
sentences of a year or less are served in jail; those that are longer involve prison time. 
 
The term corrections  came into usage during a period in which the ruling philosophy was that 
confinement could reform a lawbreaker. Thus, prisons for young persons were rechristened 
as reformatories. The programs—at least in blueprint— focused on education, group therapy, 
skills training, and similar projects geared toward allowing a released inmate to live in a self-fulfilling 
manner after release. Nonetheless, the core of prison existence clearly was  
punitive and most observers regarded the “rehabilitative” programs as little more than 
window-dressing.  
 
Today, the prevailing philosophy undergirding imprisonment is labeled “just deserts”; that is, 
a person who has hurt others and undermined the well-being of society has “earned” 
through his behavior the consequence of deprivation of liberty and the concomitant 
characteristics of imprisonment. There is no need, just desert advocates believe, to coat 
imprisonment with cozy descriptors; it is treatment that an offender deserves because of his 
self-interested illegal behavior. 
 
Incapacitation  is the ruling rationale of the just deserts approach. By definition, imprisonment 
reduces crime by removing the opportunity for the offender to violate the law. There is, of 
course, a considerable level of criminal activity within a correctional institution that primarily 
involves drug-taking and assaults, including sexual assaults. But at least those outside the 
prison are protected from the depredations of those inside it. The key issue is that virtually 
all individuals who are incapacitated in an institutional setting (including those sentenced 
under the three-strikes laws) will someday be released. If they are pushed further into crime 
by their prison experience, it is possible that they might commit more serious offenses upon 
their release than they would have if they were given a lesser or lighter sentence. 
 
It is sometimes argued that white-collar criminals need not be imprisoned since their 
violations most often are tied to the occupational positions they occupy, and thus their 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Punishment and the Criminal Justice System

patterns of offending can usually be eliminated by removing them from their business or 
professional positions. Doctors will no longer violate the laws governing medical benefit 
programs if their license to practice medicine is revoked, nor will inside traders have the 
chance to carry on their illegal activities if they are barred from trading either directly or by 
proxy. 
 
The difficulty with this reasoning is that incapacitation involves questions of equity; that is, 
whether all those who violate the law are treated similarly, with no favoritism to the wealthy 
and well placed. There also is the matter of general as opposed to specific deterrence. Specific 
deterrence  refers to keeping the individual who broke the law from doing so again. General 
deterrence  involves demonstrating to others the consequences of law-breaking so that they will 
not succumb to the temptation of doing so. Those with philosophical inclinations might 
seek to puzzle out the justice of punishing one person in order to teach other people a 
lesson, but the criminal justice system, not concerned with such esoteric matters, seeks to 
serve the ends of both specific and general deterrence in its response to law violators.
