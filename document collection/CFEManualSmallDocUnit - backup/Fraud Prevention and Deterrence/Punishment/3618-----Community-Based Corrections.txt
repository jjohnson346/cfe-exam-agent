Community-Based Corrections 
To ease overcrowding, community-based correctional facilities have become commonplace. 
While some people might be sentenced directly to such programs, they typically house 
individuals who have completed time inside institutional walls. Community-based programs 
emphasize the use of neighborhood residential re-entry centers (also known as halfway 
houses), comprehensive sanction centers, and home confinement.
