Public Perceptions of White-Collar Crime 
Studies indicate that white-collar offenses, particularly those that inflict physical harm, are 
seen by the public to be as serious as more traditional kinds of crime — those offenses that, 
as one early criminologist noted, carry a “brimstone smell.” 
 
A poll by the National Survey of Crime Severity gathered the opinions of 60,000 
respondents l8 years of age or older about a list of criminal acts. Each respondent was asked 
to rate the crimes listed. The results showed, among other things, that fraud by a grocer and 
a $l0 embezzlement were perceived to be as serious as an obscene phone call. Acceptance of 
a bribe by a city politician and an armed robbery that netted $l,000 were also rated at about 
the same level. The following table presents the results of the study, showing the crimes in 
order of increasing seriousness and indicating the white-collar offenses in boldface type.
