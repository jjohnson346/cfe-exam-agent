Offenders Ranked by Status, with Selected Demographic Information 
 
High  
 
 
•Anti-trust 
 
 
 
•Securities  
These offenders committed the crimes with the largest dollar impact, and the 
widest geographic scope. They are overwhelmingly white (99%-plus) and male 
(99.1% for anti-trust, 97.8% for securities). The groups are equally likely to 
hold a college degree (40.9% in either case), and their frauds were usually 
occupational in nature. There are revealing contrasts when these two types of 
offenders are compared: 
 
1) Almost 97% of anti-trust offenders had been steadily employed in the

years preceding their crime, while only about 60% of the securities 
offenders had continually held a job. 
2)  The anti-trusters had a median ratio of assets to liabilities of $200,000 
(assets) to $40,000 (liabilities); the securities offenders medianly held 
$57,500 in assets with $54,000 in liabilities. 
3) Anti-trust violators were more likely to own their own homes (73.5% vs. 
58.2%) and to be married (95.7% vs. 80.7%) than securities offenders.  
Middle  
 
•Tax fraud 
 
 
•Bribery  
These offenders are mainly white males, around 45 years old. Their crimes are 
not usually occupational—just 15% for tax fraud and less than 18% for 
bribery. Roughly 57% of offenders owned their own homes, and about 28% 
held a college degree. Their median assets ranged from $45,000–$49,500; 
median liabilities were between $19,000 and $23,500. The authors remark that 
although tax fraud is a typical white-collar crime, “two-thirds of the tax 
offenders work in the manufacturing or nonprofessional service sectors.” 
Low  
 
•Credit fraud 
 
•Mail fraud 
 
•False claims  
This group was not as likely to be white—71.5% for credit fraud, 76.8% for 
mail fraud, 61.8% for false claims—or male—84.8% for credit fraud, 82.1% 
for mail fraud, 84.7% for false claims. They were generally younger than the 
other category offenders (less than 40 years old); less likely to be married 
(about 50%); and less likely to own their own home (roughly 34–45% across 
the three crime types). Their net worth, as per the ratio of assets to liabilities, 
was remarkably low: $7,000/$7,000 for credit fraud; $2,000/$3,500 for mail 
fraud; $4,000/$5,000 for false claims. 
Outside Hierarchy  
 
 
•Bank embezzlement  
These offenders were placed outside the rankings because they were 
dramatically younger (a mean age of 31) and more likely to be female (44.8% 
female/55.2% male) than the other gr oups. While nearly 25% of the low-
 status group was unemployed at the time of their crime, only 3% of 
embezzlers were without a job (just slightly above the 2.8% rate for high-
 status offenders). They are the group least likely to have a college degree 
(12.9%) or to own their own home (28.4%). Their median net worth was 
$2,000 in assets with $3,000 in liabilities. Male embezzlers were usually 
managers of a local banking operation, while females were most often tellers 
or clerical workers.  
 
However difficult it may prove to be to sort out the demography of Crimes, the strength of 
the analysis lies in its tracing of the path of criminals through the federal system. Following

their core group from offense to conviction, the authors report on general trends in the 
treatment and sentencing of white-collar criminals. The most surprising conclusion states 
that people of higher social status, once convicted, are more likely than similar offenders to 
receive prison time and to be fined.
