Reporting Programs 
Each employee in the company should know where to report suspicious, unethical, or illegal 
behavior. A reporting program should emphasize that: 
• Fraud, waste, and abuse occur in nearly all companies. 
• Such conduct costs the company jobs and profits. 
• The company actively encourages any employee with information to come forward. 
• The employee can come forward and provide information anonymously and without 
fear of recrimination for good-faith reporting. 
• There is an exact method for reporting (i.e., a telephone number, name, or other 
information). 
• The report need not be made to one’s immediate superiors.
