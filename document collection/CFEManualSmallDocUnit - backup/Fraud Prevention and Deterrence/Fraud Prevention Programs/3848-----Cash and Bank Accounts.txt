Cash and Bank Accounts 
All cash and bank account transactions must be handled so as to avoid any question or 
suspicion of impropriety. All cash transactions must be recorded in the company’s books  
of account.  
 
All accounts of company funds, except authorized imprest funds, shall be established and 
maintained in the name of the company or one of its subsidiaries and might be opened or 
closed only on the authority of the company’s Board of Directors. Imprest funds must be 
maintained in the name of the custodian and the custodian is wholly responsible for these 
funds. All cash received shall be promptly recorded and deposited in a company or 
subsidiary bank account. No funds shall be maintained in the form of cash, except 
authorized petty cash, and no company shall maintain an anonymous (numbered) account at 
any bank. Payments into numbered bank accounts by the company might leave that 
company open to suspicion of participation in a possibly improper transaction. Therefore, 
no disbursements of any nature might be made into numbered bank accounts or other 
accounts not clearly identified to the company as to their ownership.

documentation. Further, corporate checks shall not be written to “cash,” “bearer,” or  
similar designations.
