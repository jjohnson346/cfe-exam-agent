The Impact on the Bottom Line 
One of the best ways to sell management on fraud prevention is by showing the impact on 
the bottom line. Fraud impacts net sales dollar for dollar. For example, if a company nets 20 
percent on sales, they must sell five items at regular prices to recover losses from the theft of 
one item. Fraud can be very expensive.
