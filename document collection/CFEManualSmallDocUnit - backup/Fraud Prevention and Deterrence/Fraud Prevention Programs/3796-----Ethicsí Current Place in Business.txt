Ethics’ Current Place in Business 
The decline in public attitudes about business in recent years has reinforced the importance 
of ethics in the workplace. Although there seems to be a further deterioration of public 
confidence, substantial endeavors have been made by organizations with respect to business 
ethics. These initiatives include adoption of codes of conduct, introduction of ethics into 
employee and management training, and the establishment of ethics and compliance offices.  
 
Corporate ethics initiatives have accelerated over the last decade due in part to the impact of 
the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations. These Guidelines can multiply or 
mitigate potentially devastating penalties for errant corporations, depending on their 
attempts to prevent such misconduct with effective compliance programs.
