Increasing the Perception of Detection 
Most experts agree that it is much easier to prevent than detect fraud. To prevent fraud, we 
should understand something about the mind of the potential perpetrator. Increasing the 
perception of detection might be the most effective fraud prevention method. Controls, for 
example, do little good in forestalling theft and fraud, if those at risk do not know of the 
presence of possible detection. In the audit profession, this means letting employees, 
managers, and executives know that auditors are actively seeking out information concerning 
internal theft. This can be accomplished in several ways.
