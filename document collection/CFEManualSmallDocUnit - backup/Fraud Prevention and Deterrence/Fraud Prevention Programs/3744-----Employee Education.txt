Employee Education 
Each entity should have some policy for educating managers, executives, and employees 
about fraud. This can be done as a part of employee orientation, or it can be accomplished 
through memoranda, training programs, and other intercompany communication methods. 
The goal is to make others within the company your eyes and ears. 
 
Any education effort should be positive and not accusatory. Illegal conduct in any form 
eventually costs everyone in the company through lost profits, adverse publicity, and 
decreased morale and productivity. These facts should be emphasized in training.
