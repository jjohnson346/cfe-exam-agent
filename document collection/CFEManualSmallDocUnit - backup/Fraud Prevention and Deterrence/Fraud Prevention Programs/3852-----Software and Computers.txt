Software and Computers 
Computerized information and computer software appear intangible, but they are valuable 
assets of the company and must be protected from misuse, theft, fraud, loss, and 
unauthorized use or disposal, just as any other company property. 
  
Use of mainframe computers must be customer service or job related. Employees cannot 
access company records of any kind for their personal use. Misappropriation of computer 
space, time, or software includes, but is not limited to, using a computer to create or run 
unauthorized jobs, operating a computer in an unauthorized mode, or intentionally causing 
any kind of operational failure. 
 
Personal computers can be used for company-sanctioned education programs as well as 
personal use incidental to company business use with the permission of your supervisor. 
However, personal use cannot be allowed for personal financial gain. 
 
It is also understood that personal computers will occasionally be used at home with the 
permission of your supervisor.
