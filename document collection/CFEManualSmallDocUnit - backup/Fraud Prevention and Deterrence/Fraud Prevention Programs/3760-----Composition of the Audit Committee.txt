Composition of the Audit Committee 
The Act also sets forth certain requirements regarding the composition of audit committees. 
Under Section 301, every member of the audit committee must also be a member of the 
company’s board of directors, which ensures that the committee will have sufficient 
authority within the company to carry out its duties. Furthermore, Section 407 of the Act 
requires every public company to disclose in its SEC reports whether at least one member of 
the audit committee is a “financial expert,” and if  not, to explain the reasons why. Financial 
experts are defined by SOX as persons who, through education and professional experience, 
possess the following: (1) an understanding of generally accepted accounting principles and 
financial statements; (2) experience in prepar ing or auditing financial statements of 
comparable companies and in accounting for estimates, accruals, and reserves in those 
companies; (3) experience with internal controls; and (4) an understanding of audit 
committee functions.  
 
Finally, Section 301 expressly states that audit committees must be given sufficient authority 
and funding to hire attorneys and other advisors necessary to carry out their duties.
