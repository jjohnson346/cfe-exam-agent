Relationships with Suppliers and Customers 
Business transactions must be entered into solely for the best interests of the company. No 
employee can, directly or indirectly, benefit from his position as an employee or from any 
sale, purchase, or other activity of the company. Employees should avoid situations 
involving a conflict or the appearance of conflict between duty to the company and  
self-interest.  
 
No employee who deals with individuals or organizations doing or seeking to do business 
with the company, or who makes recommendations with respect to such dealings, should: 
• Serve as an officer, director, employee, or consultant. 
• Own a substantial interest in any competitor of the company, or any organization doing 
or seeking to do business with the company. Substantial interest means an economic 
interest that might influence or reasonably be thought to influence judgment or action, 
but shall not include an investment representing less than 1 percent of a class of 
outstanding securities of a publicly held corporation. Every employee must complete the 
Conflict of Interest Questionnaire included with this book.  
 
In addition, no employee who deals with individuals or organizations doing or seeking to  
do business with the company, or who makes recommendations with respect to such 
dealings, might: 
• Have any other direct or indirect personal interest in any business transactions with the 
company (other than customary employee purchases of company products and services 
as consumers and transactions where the interest arises solely by reason of the employee 
relationship or that of a holder of securities). 
• Provide telecommunications or information service or equipment, either directly  
or as a reseller, in a manner that would place the objectivity or integrity of the company 
in question. 
 
Our policy is that employees will not do busi ness on behalf of the company with a close 
personal friend or relative; however, recognizing that these transactions do occur, they must 
be reported on the Conflict of Interest Questionnaire.

This policy is applicable equally to the members of the immediate family of each employee, 
which normally includes your spouse, children and their spouses, and the father, mother, 
sisters, and brothers of yourself and your household.
