Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
No employee will engage in activity that might involve the employee or the company in a 
violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
requires that the company’s books and records accurately and fairly reflect all transactions 
and that we maintain a system of internal controls; that transactions conform to 
management’s authorizations; and that the accounting records are accurate. No employee 
will falsely report transactions or fail to report the existence of false transactions in the 
accounting records. Employees certifying the correctness of records, including vouchers or 
bills, should have reasonable knowledge that the information is correct and proper. 
 
Under the Act, it is also a federal crime for any U.S. business enterprise to offer a gift, 
payment, or bribe, or anything else of value, whether directly or indirectly, to any foreign 
official, foreign political party or party official, or candidate for foreign political office for the 
purpose of influencing an official act or decision, or seeking influence with a foreign 
government in order to obtain, retain, or direct business to the company or to any person. 
Even if the payment is legal in the host country, it is forbidden by the Act and violates  
U.S. law.
