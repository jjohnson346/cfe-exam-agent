The Attorney Work Product Doctrine 
Under Rule 26(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and under comparable state 
rules, documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation are 
protected by the attorney’s work product doctrine or privilege. The privilege is conditional in part: 
The opposing party may obtain access to otherwise privileged investigative documents and 
things through pre-trial discovery if it can show substantial need  for the protected information 
and that the information cannot be obtained from another source. However, the attorney’s 
mental impressions, opinions, and strategies concerning the litigation are absolutely privileged 
and cannot be discovered even with a showing of substantial need. The privilege extends to not 
only information and documents prepared by a party or the party’s attorneys, but also by the 
consultants and examiners hired by the attorneys. For instance, communications with the 
attorney and any work or analysis done by an expert with whom the attorney has consulted is 
privileged as work product, although that privilege will be waived if the expert is called to 
testify as an expert witness at trial.  
 
Work product protection applies only to documents and things prepared  in anticipation of

litigation or for trial. Thus, documents and tangible things prepared in the course of an in-house 
or other pre-litigation investigation, even if at the direction of an attorney, may not be 
privileged if they were not prepared in anticipation of litigation. Just because there is a possibility 
of future litigation does not mean that the investigation is in anticipation thereof. Litigation 
must be actually planned and the work for which protection is sought must have been 
undertaken for the specific purpose of preparing for that litigation. But if the work to be 
protected was done in anticipation of litigation, then it does not matter in most jurisdictions that 
no lawsuit has been filed yet. 
 
The privilege protects documents and things prepared in anticipation of litigation from 
compelled disclosure. Nevertheless, it does not render the facts themselves confidential, 
privileged, or non-discoverable. Thus, while reports, interview notes, and transcripts might 
not be discoverable under the privilege, the facts learned may have to be provided in response 
to properly phrased discovery requests. Similarly, the privilege does not prevent discovery of 
the identity of witnesses and the existence of interview notes, tapes, or transcripts. The extent 
to which interview notes, transcripts, and other factual reports prepared in anticipation of 
litigation are actually protected from discovery by a party opponent may vary between 
jurisdictions and may depend on the facts and circumstances of a given case.
