Waiver of Work Product Protection 
Like the attorney-client privilege, work product protection can be waived. Moreover, the 
Federal Rule of Evidence 502 expressly applies to disclosure of a communication or 
information covered by work product protection. Therefore, the examiner should abide by 
the same rules governing disclosure of materials protected by the attorney-client privilege.
