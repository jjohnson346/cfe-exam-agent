Diagrams 
A diagram  is a schematic or technical drawing that is used to help make something easier to 
understand. A diagram (on paper or some other tangible display) can be admitted as evidence 
with no more foundation than the assent of a witness: “Is this a fair representation of the 
suite where you work?” It does not have to be true to scale or particularly detailed. A diagram 
can be prepared before trial, during trial, or prepped outside the court and finished during 
questioning. If a party objects to the admission of a diagram, the offering party may need to 
establish that it is reliable. Diagrams can be used in tandem with photos or other 
representational evidence, or as assistance in demonstrations to the jury.
