COMPUTER RECORDS  
Courts typically accept computer files and documents as evidence. In fact, courts themselves 
are using more electronic resources because many aspects of litigation can now be conducted 
electronically. 
 
Traditionally, to be admitted as evidence, computerized records need only meet the usual 
business-records authentication, which requires that the computerized records be

accompanied by certification by a qualified person stating that (1) the records were prepared 
reasonably near the time of the event they describe, (2) the records were prepared as a usual 
part of doing business, and (3) the organization’s way of keeping records is demonstrably 
reliable.  
 
The required supporting material to authenticate computer records will include information 
on the computing machine used, any software, and the record-keeping process. A business 
record, electronic or otherwise, is legal as long as it’s kept in the normal course of business. 
When there are clear routines for compiling information, admitting the record into court will 
be routine.  
 
Recently, however, courts have recognized that authentication of computerized records may 
require greater scrutiny because, unlike other ESI evidence, the primary authentication issue 
regarding computerized records is what has, or may have, happened to the record in the time 
between when it was entered in the files and the time of trial. Based upon this view, the most 
likely methods of authenticating computerized records are: 
• Witness with personal knowledge (e.g., an authenticating witness attests to the process by 
which the computerized records are created, acquired, maintained, and preserved) 
• Circumstantial evidence of distinctive characteristics (e.g., a person’s business habit is 
consistent with the document) 
• Certified copies of business records (e.g., computerized records are accompanied by 
custodian’s written certification)
