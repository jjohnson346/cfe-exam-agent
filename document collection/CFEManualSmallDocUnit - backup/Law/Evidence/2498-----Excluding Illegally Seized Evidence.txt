Excluding Illegally Seized Evidence 
In general, evidence obtained improperly is tainted and unfit for trial. The Fourth 
Amendment sets out this cornerstone exclusionary rule, barring anything obtained by 
authorities without proper authorization from the owner or possessor, or through a court-ordered 
search warrant. Generally, this rule applies only in criminal cases, But it also applies 
to government employers. Therefore, a public employer cannot use illegally seized evidence 
to discipline an employee. There is no Fourth Amendment prohibition against a private  
employer using illegally seized evidence to discipline an employee, however. But if a private 
employer does use illegally seized evidence to discipline an employee, the employer might be 
exposing itself to litigation for invasion of privacy, trespass, or other common law causes of 
action, even though the evidence may still be admitted in court.
