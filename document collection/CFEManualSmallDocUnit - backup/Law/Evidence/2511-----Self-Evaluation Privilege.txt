Self-Evaluation Privilege 
The self-evaluation privilege (also referred to as the self-critical privilege) may provide some 
protection for the investigative work product. This privilege is based on the need to 
encourage voluntary internal reviews and compliance programs. It applies if an organization 
can demonstrate that it is attempting to police itself in an area of public interest, and that 
disclosure of the work product would prejudice such efforts. The privilege is a relatively new 
concept and is not recognized in all jurisdictions. It is much weaker than the attorney-client 
and attorney work product privileges.
