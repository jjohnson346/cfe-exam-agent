The McNulty Memorandum and the DOJ Guidelines 
On December 12, 2006, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued guidelines (in the form of 
the McNulty Memorandum) for federal investigation and prosecution of business 
organizations. The McNulty Memorandum, which addressed the practice of federal 
prosecutors investigating and charging business organization misconduct, revised the DOJ’s 
prior guidance outlined in the much maligned Thompson Memorandum, which provided that 
federal prosecutors could seek waiver of the attorney-client privileges and attorney work 
product protections as an element of a company’s cooperation. Specifically, the McNulty 
Memorandum provided specific criteria that prosecutors were required to consider and 
procedures they were required to follow before seeking waiver of privileges or work product 
protection. 
 
On August 28, 2008, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued guidelines, which revised the 
McNulty Memorandum, on how federal prosecutors investigate, charge, and prosecute 
corporate crimes. Unlike the McNulty Memorandum, the guidelines are a part of the U.S. 
attorney’s manual, which provides internal DOJ guidance but does not create any enforceable 
law. 
 
In an effort to stop congressional action, such that proposed by S. 445, the guidelines bar 
prosecutors from judging corporate cooperation for leniency on whether an entity is willing 
to waive the attorney-client privilege or work product protection. The guidelines also state 
that prosecutors can no longer seek disclosure of information that is either privileged or 
protected work product. In addition, the guidelines provide that when evaluating a 
corporation’s cooperation, prosecutors may no longer consider whether a company is

advancing legal fees for its employees, whether a corporation has sanctioned or retained 
culpable employees, or whether a corporation has entered into joint defense agreements.  
 
Even though most observers agree that the guidelines are a significant improvement over the 
McNulty Memorandum, many contend that comprehensive legislation is still needed to make 
the DOJ’s reforms permanent and prevent a relapse in department policy, as well as to bar 
similar waiver policies adopted by other federal agencies such as the Securities Exchange 
Commission and the Internal Revenue Service. For this reason, the DOJ’s guidelines may 
stop interested parties from supporting the enactment of legislation that would further 
protect corporations and their employees from government-coerced waiver.
