Relevance 
Although the admissibility of evidence depends on a number of factors, the most important 
factor is relevance. The general rule of evidence provides that all relevant evidence is 
admissible. Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence defines relevant evidence  as evidence 
“having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to 
determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the 
evidence.” In other words, evidence is relevant if it tends to make some fact in issue more or 
less likely than it would be without the evidence. The facts in issue, of course, vary according 
to the case, but generally can be said to be those that tend to prove the essential elements of 
the offense or claim, as well as related matters such as motive, opportunity, identity of the 
parties, and credibility. 
 
Whether a particular piece of evidence is relevant or not depends on what the evidence is 
offered to prove. An item of evidence might be relevant and admissible if offered to prove 
one thing, but not relevant and inadmissible if offered to prove something else. For example, 
under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts 
committed by the defendant would not be admissible if offered to prove that the defendant is 
generally a bad person, and therefore is likely to have committed the crime with which he is 
charged. However, evidence would be admissible if offered to prove motive, intent, identity, 
absence of mistake, or modus operandi, if such factors are at issue. If evidence of other 
wrongs or acts is admitted, the judge will instruct the jury that they may consider the evidence

only as it relates to the narrow issue for which it was admitted, and may not consider it for 
any other purpose.  
 
That evidence is relevant does not, however, automatically mean that it will be admitted. 
Under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, relevant evidence still might be excluded if 
it is unduly prejudicial, threatens to confuse or mislead the jury, threatens to cause 
unnecessary delay or waste of time, or is merely cumulative. Relevant evidence also might be 
excluded if it is subject to certain privileges as noted below. Thus, evidence of drug addiction 
technically might be relevant to prove motive for embezzlement or fraud, but the judge still 
might exclude the evidence if he believes that its probative value is outweighed by the danger 
of prejudice to the defendant. Evidence of other crimes and acts, as discussed above, that are 
otherwise relevant also might be excluded for the same reason.
