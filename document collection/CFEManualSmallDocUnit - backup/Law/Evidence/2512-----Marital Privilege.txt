Marital Privilege 
Additionally, the marital privilege protects communications between husbands and wives. 
There are two forms of the marital or spousal privilege: (1) the confidential communications 
privilege, enabling either spouse to prevent the other from testifying regarding a 
communication during marriage between the two that was intended to be in confidence, and 
(2) the adverse testimony privilege, protecting spouses from being compelled to testify against each 
other while they are married. Usually, the confidential communications privilege continues

after the termination of the marriage; the adverse testimony privilege does not.  
 
There is no privilege that permits a person not to testify against other family members, 
although, as a matter of policy, many law enforcement agencies will not compel testimony 
from immediate family members.
