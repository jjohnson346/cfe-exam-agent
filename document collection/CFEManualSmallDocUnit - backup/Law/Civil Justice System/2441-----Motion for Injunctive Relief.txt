Motion for Injunctive Relief 
As noted above, an injunction is a court order by which a party is required to perform, or is 
restrained from performing, a specific act. In a fraud case, the defendant is likely to have 
misappropriated assets, and there may be a substantial risk that he may try to hide or transfer 
the ill-gotten gains. If the money or assets taken can be located, the plaintiff can ask for a 
writ of attachment to secure the assets. However, there often are cases where the money 
may not be located yet. In these cases, the plaintiff or the prosecutor can ask the judge to 
issue an injunction.
