LITIGATION HOLD PROCEDURES  
Organizations should also create litigation hold procedures, which provide a process whereby a 
company issues a litigation hold communication that notifies employees to suspend the 
destruction of potentially relevant records when the duty to preserve relevant information 
arises. The duty to preserve relevant data begins when a lawsuit is “reasonably anticipated.”  
 
There are, however, certain attributes of ESI that make executing a timely litigation hold 
difficult, including: (1) ESI may only be available for a temporary time period, (2) business 
practices are often designed to free up storage space, and (3) ESI is particularly problematic 
because of its sheer volume.  
 
Timely imposing a litigation hold is necessary to avoid sanctions, including monetary fines 
and sanctions, adverse inference jury instruction sanctions, or dismissal of claims or 
defenses.
