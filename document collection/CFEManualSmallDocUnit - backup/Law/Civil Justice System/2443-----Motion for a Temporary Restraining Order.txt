Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order  
A temporary restraining order (TRO) is an emergency, temporary injunction ordering the 
defendant to perform, or not perform, some act. Like preliminary injunctions, TROs are 
ordered to prevent irreparable injury. Unlike preliminary injunctions, however, TROs can be 
entered without the defendant being present and are usually entered without notice to the 
other party. It is only good for up to 10 days until the defendant can appear before the judge.
