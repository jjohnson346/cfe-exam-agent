DOCUMENT RETENTION POLICIES  
Document retention policies that instruct employees on which documents to preserve or 
destroy are an important component of any risk management program. For this reason, 
organizations should adopt such policies, and management must effectively monitor and 
revise them. This is especially important given the growing amount, locations, and formats 
of ESI in today’s environment, which create additional risks and costs for companies that do 
not have such policies for both physical and digital data.
