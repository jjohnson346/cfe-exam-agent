Application for a Preliminary Injunction 
A preliminary injunction is a court order that the defendant perform, or not perform, some 
act while the suit is being contested. If a lawsuit between the parties is pending, a judge can 
issue a preliminary injunction, which freezes everything until a trial can be held. The 
injunction will prohibit the defendant from transferring or moving any assets unless first 
approved by the court. A preliminary injunction is usually issued only after the other party 
has been given an opportunity to respond
