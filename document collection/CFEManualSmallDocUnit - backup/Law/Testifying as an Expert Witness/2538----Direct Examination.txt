Testifying as an Expert Witness


:


Direct Examination  
Direct examinations are conducted by the attorney who retained the expert. Because experts 
are hired for their opinions, they are not subject to the usual restrictions about statements of 
judgment. Experts also have other leeway not given to ordinary witnesses. They may rely on 
documents or exchanges that would otherwise be inadmissible as hearsay. This allows them to 
use articles, academic papers, professional texts, and consultations in rendering their opinions 
of the case. These materials are admissible as long as they were used by the expert in 
developing his opinion.
