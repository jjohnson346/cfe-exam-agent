Witness Immunity for Experts 
Generally, federal and state courts grant fact witnesses immunity for their testimony at trial. 
There are three commonly cited public policy rationales for granting this immunity. First, the 
immunity rule prevents self-censorship of the witness. Second, without immunity, witnesses 
may be inclined to distort their testimony in fear of a retaliatory suit. Third, the cross-examination 
process ensures truthful and reliable testimony.  
 
Furthermore, courts have extended witness immunity to include adverse expert witnesses and 
court-appointed expert witnesses. This immunity generally applies to trial testimony, 
deposition testimony, and report preparation. Courts grant immunity to adverse and court-appointed 
experts for numerous reasons, including the long-standing common law witness 
immunity doctrine, the prevention of witness self-censorship, and the belief that the judicial 
system adequately ensures truthful and reliable testimony. However, even though immunity is 
the general rule for adverse and court-appointed experts, courts have denied immunity and 
permitted negligence claims where testifying experts breach their professional duty to act 
within the standard of care.  
 
Despite the witness immunity discussed above, recent cases indicate that expert witnesses may 
be liable to their retaining party for their pre-trial work or testimony, ruling that expert 
witnesses should not be immune from liability from their own clients. In fact, a growing 
number of states have allowed parties to sue their own experts for negligent testimony, 
including California, Connecticut, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, and 
Pennsylvania.  
 
The underlying bases for denying immunity to friendly experts are generally founded on the 
following rationales: (1) the common law grou nds for immunity are narrow; (2) potential 
liability encourages total and honest testimony; (3) experts should be held to the standard of 
their profession; (4) the role of the paid advisor and advocate warrants allowing claims; and (5) 
the judicial system does not adequately ensure truthful and reliable testimony from friendly 
experts.

Expert witnesses should be aware that the witness immunity defense for experts is eroding, 
and as a result, suits alleging that expert witnesses committed fraud or negligence are 
increasing. Moreover, the presence of expert witnesses in the legal system will not decrease in 
the near future. Therefore, it is important that expert witnesses understand the liabilities and 
protections placed upon them.
