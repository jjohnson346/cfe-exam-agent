Testifying as an Expert Witness


:


Sounding Board 
This method uses the witness as a sounding board to reacquaint the jury with the favorable 
aspects (to opposing counsel) of the case. This technique often uses the “is it not true?” and 
“would you agree with me?” approach. Constant agreement is useful to browbeat the expert. 
In the eyes of the judge and jury, agreement with various questions raised by the opposing 
counsel also might be assumed to be a general concurrence with the position of the opposing 
counsel.
