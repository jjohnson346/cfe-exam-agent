Conflicts of Interest 
When retained, experts must quickly determine if any conflicts of interest exist — or even 
appear to exist — in a particular case because a conflict might preclude participation. A conflict 
of interest exists when an expert’s ability to objectively evaluate and present an issue for a 
client will be impaired by any current, prior, or future relationship with parties to the litigation. 
 
There are several actions an expert can take to determine if any conflicts of interest exist. 
Before engagement, ask for the names of all parties involved. Review the names with your 
associates as well, requesting full disclosure of any connections, however remote. Prior or

loyalty to the cause and your client.  
 
Penalties for consulting or acting as an expert in a conflict of interest include expert 
disqualification, attorney disqualification, and inadmissibility of expert testimony.
