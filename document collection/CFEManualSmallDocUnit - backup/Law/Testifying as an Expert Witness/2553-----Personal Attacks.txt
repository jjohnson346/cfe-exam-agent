Testifying as an Expert Witness


:


Personal Attacks 
Another cross-examination tactic often used by attorneys is to “kill the messenger.” These 
attacks are of a more personal nature and generally include some of the following: 
• The witness is unqualified. 
• The witness displayed unprofessional behavior during the examination (such as asking 
personal or sexual questions during interviews). 
• The witness had a conflict of interest. 
• The witness was harassing (phone calls at home, threatening voice mails, etc.).
