Testifying as an Expert Witness


:


Contradiction 
Opposing counsel might use leading questions to force the witness into a hard or 
contradictory position. Alternately, counsel can establish the credibility in court of a 
potentially contradicting document or quote from other articles written by experts in the field. 
If these documents or articles are in contradiction to the expert, then an admission can be 
obtained from the expert as to that contradiction. If a contradiction exits, the expert might be 
drawn into an argument as to who is the most appropriate or experienced person. Instances 
also occur in which a witness has contradicted himself or his own article written several years 
prior merely because of his lack of memory or confusion due to the attack.
