Testifying as an Expert Witness


:


Depositions of Expert Witnesses 
A deposition is sworn testimony given by a party or witness upon questioning by counsel for 
one of the parties before trial and outside of court. A deposition serves as a powerful 
discovery device that may be used to compel anyone associated with the case to give oral 
testimony under oath. Although you cannot decline to testify, an expert may be allowed to 
specify a convenient time and place.  
 
Sometimes the party requesting the deposition pays the opposing expert’s fee — which consists 
of the time spent giving the deposition at his standard hourly rate or in half-day or full-day 
increments, plus travel time. This usually occurs in federal court. Most state courts require 
each side to pay the expenses of the expert’s they hire. An expert charges his client for the 
time spent preparing for deposition and for testifying. 
 
In addition to the required court reporter, the proceeding may be recorded by a camera or a 
voice recorder. A judge is not present during this question-and-answer session. For skilled 
investigators, deposition provides a golden opportunity to hear the other side’s case aloud. 
The opposition may set ulterior goals as well, including:

• To learn new information or confirm existing facts 
• To appraise the expert’s ability as a witness 
• To lock the expert into a hard-to-defend position 
• To create a written record for future impeachment 
 
Before testifying at a deposition or at trial, the expert should ensure that required graphic 
displays are ready and available, that all important discussions with the lawyer have been held, 
and that the expert has a complete understanding of the report and other relevant issues. The 
expert should ensure that he has agreement with counsel as to the sequence of evidence and 
the strategy for presenting it. It often is useful to have a “dry run” at the direct testimony, with 
all the questions posed by the counsel to the expert, to avoid surprises during trial. 
 
At pre-testimony meetings, it is appropriate to discuss the qualifications of the witness again 
to ensure that they are current, to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the case, and to 
discuss and agree on what parts of the expert’s reports, if any, are to be entered as exhibits.
