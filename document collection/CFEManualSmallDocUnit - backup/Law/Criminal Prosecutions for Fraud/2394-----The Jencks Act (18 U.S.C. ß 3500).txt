The Jencks Act (18 U.S.C. § 3500) 
The Jencks Act permits the defendant to obtain, prior to cross-examination, a government 
witness’s prior statements (or portions thereof) that relate to the subject matter of his 
testimony on direct examination. However, the statute also protects statements from 
discovery until after the direct examination has been completed. The statements that must be 
produced include not only the written statements signed by the witness, but also may include 
notes or memoranda of government agents or prosecutors which set forth what the witness 
said during interviews.
