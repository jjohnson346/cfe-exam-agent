DUE DILIGENCE 
The organization must take at least seven minimum steps to meet the requirement of due 
diligence: 
• Implement policies defining standards and procedures to be followed by the 
organization’s agents and employees 
• Assign specific high-level personnel ultimate responsibility to ensure compliance 
• Use due care not to delegate significant discretionary authority to people whom the 
organization knows or should have known had a propensity to engage in illegal activities 
• Communicate standards and procedures to all agents and employees and require 
participation in training programs 
• Take reasonable steps to achieve compliance, e.g., by the use of monitoring and auditing 
systems, and by having and publicizing a reporting system where employees can refer 
criminal conduct without fear of retribution (hot line or ombudsman program)
