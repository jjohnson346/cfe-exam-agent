Discovery Under Rule 16 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 identifies the information that each side must 
disclose. Generally, the defense is entitled to inspect and copy statements made by the 
defendant. The defense also may inspect the defendant’s prior record, material documents, 
tangible objects, and examination and test reports. 
 
If, and only if, the defendant requests discovery of documents and objects, or of 
examination and test reports, the government may seek similar kinds of materials from the 
defense. Any items that must be disclosed are required to be disclosed “as soon as 
reasonably possible.” The court may regulate the discovery process by entering protective 
orders or punishing the failure to timely provide the proper information.  
 
The rule allows the defense to obtain statements the defendant made to third parties, as well 
as government agents, if the statements were reduced to writing. Therefore, any written 
statements made by the defendant to the CFE investigating the case, if the statements were 
turned over to law enforcement or the government, must be produced. But oral statements 
made to third parties (i.e., nongovernmental agents) generally are protected from discovery.
