EFFECTIVE PROGRAM TO DETECT AND PREVENT VIOLATIONS OF LAW 
Under the guidelines, if a convicted organization has an effective compliance program in 
place at the time of the offense, the sentencing judge will consider the organization’s acts of 
due diligence in trying to prevent the illegality when deciding whether to increase or mitigate 
the sentence. The guidelines define effective compliance program  as one that is reasonably 
designed, implemented, and enforced so that it generally will be effective in preventing and 
detecting criminal conduct.  
 
The most significant change under the modified sentencing guidelines for organizations 
concerns the sentence reduction credit for having an effective compliance program. Before 
the guidelines were modified, organizations were disqualified from receiving a reduction in 
sentencing for maintaining an effective compliance program if a “high-level person” was 
involved with the fraudulent activity. Under the modified guidelines, however, involvement 
of a high-level person is no longer an automatic bar from effective compliance program 
credit, but the amendments impose several conditions to receive a reduction under these 
circumstances, including a direct reporting requirement to the governing authority (board or 
audit committee).  
 
See the chapter on “Fraud Prevention Programs” in the Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
section of the Fraud Examiners Manual for more information about developing a corporate 
compliance policy.
