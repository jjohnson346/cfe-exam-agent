Verdict of the Jury 
If the jury reaches a verdict, the foreperson or the bailiff announces the verdict in open 
court. Either party may request that the jury be polled, that is, that each juror be asked 
individually whether he concurred in the verdict. If any juror answers “no,” the jury must 
return for further deliberations or may be discharged.
