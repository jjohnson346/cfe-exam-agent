statutory rights to certain pre-trial discovery. The defendant may inspect copies of all 
relevant statements made by him (or, if a corporation, by its employees) in the custody of the 
government, a copy of the accused’s prior criminal record, and all documents, items, test 
results, and other evidence the government intends to introduce at a trial or that are 
necessary to the defense. But the defendant does not have an absolute right to see copies of 
prior statements made by a witness against him until such witness testifies at trial. In many 
cases, however, particularly fraud prosecutions where there is less risk of reprisal or 
tampering with witnesses, the government may voluntarily produce these statements before 
trial.
