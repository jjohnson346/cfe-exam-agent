Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud


:


Immunity 
In the course of a grand jury investigation or a criminal trial, the prosecution may apply for a 
court order compelling testimony from a witness under a grant of immunity. Because 
immunized testimony cannot be used against the witness in any criminal proceeding, such an 
order does not violate the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. 
 
An immunity order  protects the witness only from prosecution from past crimes about which 
testimony is compelled; other, undiscovered crimes are not covered, nor is the witness 
immune from prosecution for perjury based on the immunized testimony. Such testimony 
also may be used against the witness in a civil proceeding.  
 
Although it is legally permissible to prosecute an immunized witness on the basis of other 
testimony and evidence, as a matter of practice this is seldom done because of policy 
considerations and the difficulty of demonstrating — as the law requires — that the 
subsequent prosecution was not in any way based on the compelled testimony. 
 
A decision to immunize a witness is solely within the discretion of the prosecution. If the 
application meets statutory requirements, the court must grant the order. If the immunized

witness refuses to testify — out of fear of reprisal or for any other reason — the witness will be 
found in contempt and jailed until he agrees to testify or the grand jury term expires. The 
witness can then be summoned before a new grand jury and the process repeated indefinitely 
or until a judge decides that there is no possibility that further incarceration will induce 
cooperation.
