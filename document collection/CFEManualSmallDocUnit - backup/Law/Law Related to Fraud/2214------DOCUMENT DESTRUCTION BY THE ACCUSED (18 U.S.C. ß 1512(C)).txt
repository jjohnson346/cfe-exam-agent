DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION BY THE ACCUSED (18 U.S.C. § 1512(C)) 
Sarbanes-Oxley amended section 1512 of the U.S. Code to make it a criminal offense to 
corruptly alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal a record or document with the intent to impair 
its integrity or use in an official proceeding, or to otherwise obstruct, influence, or impede 
any official proceeding or attempt to do so. Until Congress amended section 1512, it was 
more narrowly focused on witness tampering. Violations of this section are punishable by 
fines up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to 20 years.
