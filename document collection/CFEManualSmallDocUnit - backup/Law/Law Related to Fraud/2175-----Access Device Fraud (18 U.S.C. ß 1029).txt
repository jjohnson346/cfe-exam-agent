Access Device Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1029) 
This statute criminalizes the production, use, trafficking, or possession of unauthorized or 
counterfeit access devices. Access devices are devices that allow access to account funds. 
Most importantly, section 1029 prohibits the fraudulent use of credit cards. However, 
because Congress broadly defined the term access devices, section 1029 also applies to crimes 
using other access device numbers, including debit cards, ATM cards, personal identification 
numbers (PINs), computer passwords, “or any other thing of value, or that can be used to 
initiate a transfer of funds (other than a transfer originated solely by paper instrument).”  
 
Section 1029 includes penalties of up to 15 years (up to 20 years for subsequent offenses) 
and/or fines. Additionally, forfeiture of personal property is available in many instances.
