Qui Tam Suits and the Civil False Claims Act 
A qui tam suit is one in which a private individual sues on behalf of the government to 
recover damages for criminal or fraudulent actions committed against the government. It is a 
civil not a criminal suit. Most qui tam actions are brought under the False Claims Act, 31 
U.S.C. § 3729 et seq. This statute provides, in part, that anyone who commits the following 
acts is liable to the government for three times the amount of damages it sustains, plus a civil 
penalty of $5,000 to $10,000 per false claim: 
• Knowingly presents or causes to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or 
approval (§ 3729(a)(1)) 
• Knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to get 
a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved (§ 3729(a)(2)) 
• Conspires to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or 
paid (§ 3729(a)(3)) 
• Making or delivering a document certifying receipt of property to be used by the 
government without completely knowing that the information on the receipt is true (§ 
3729(a)(5)) 
• Knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made  or used, a false record or statement to 
conceal, avoid, or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the 
government (§ 3729(a)(7))

Most qui tam actions seek to recover damages and statutory penalties for false claims made 
to the government by government contractors such as defense contractors and health care 
providers. 
 
Since 1986, when Congress substantially strengthened the civil False Claims Act, the United 
States has secured more than $24 billion in settlements and judgments ($2.4 billion in the 
2009 fiscal year alone).
