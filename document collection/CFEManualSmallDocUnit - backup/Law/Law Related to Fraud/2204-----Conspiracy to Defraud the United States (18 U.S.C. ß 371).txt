Conspiracy to Defraud the United States (18 U.S.C. § 371) 
Although numerous federal statutes make conspiracy a crime, the most commonly used 
federal conspiracy statute is the general conspiracy statute under section 371 of Title 18, U.S. 
Code. This statute renders it illegal to agree with another person, or to take joint action, to 
defraud the government. Section 371 provides: 
 
If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to 
defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or 
more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under 
this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. 
 
If, however, the offense, the commission of which is the object of the conspiracy, is a misdemeanor 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law

only, the punishment for such conspiracy shall not exceed the maximum punishment provided 
for such misdemeanor. 
 
The essential elements of this statute are: 
• Agreement to defraud 
• The defendant knew the purpose of the agreement and intentionally joined in the 
agreement 
• That at least one of the conspirators knowingly committed at least one overt act in 
furtherance of the conspiracy 
 
Under the first element, the government must prove that the defendant reached an 
agreement or understanding with at least one other person. The conspirators must agree 
about the precise fraud involved. An agreement to defraud the government, without further 
qualification about the nature of the fraud, is not sufficient to support a conviction under 
this statute.  
 
The government must also establish that the defendant knew of the conspiracy’s existence 
and its objective. The government, however, does not have to establish that the defendant 
knew all the details or objectives of the conspiracy, and they do not have to prove that the 
defendant knew the identity of all the participants in the conspiracy.  
 
Finally, the purpose of the conspiracy need not be accomplished for a violation to occur, but 
at least one of the co-conspirators must have carried out at least one overt act in furtherance 
of the conspiracy. The overt act need not be criminal and could be as innocuous as making a 
phone call or writing a letter. 
 
Conspiracy counts are favored by prosecutors because they provide evidentiary and pleading 
advantages. If a conspiracy is shown, the acts and statements of one co-conspirator may be 
admitted into evidence against all, and each co-conspirator may be convicted for the 
underlying substantive offense (e.g., destroying government property) committed by any one 
of its members.  
 
A corporation cannot conspire with one of its own employees to commit an offense because 
the employee and employer are legally viewed as one. A corporation, however, can conspire 
with other business entities or third parties to violate the statute.
