Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. § 3663A) 
The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA) expands the scope of mandatory 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.338  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
restitution on the federal level. It requires federal courts to order restitution for each 
defendant, without consideration of the defendant’s economic circumstances, who has been 
convicted or plead guilty to charges for certain categories of offenses, including fraud under 
Title 18, U.S. Code. Thus, victim corporations may be entitled to victim compensation, just 
like natural persons.  
 
Recently, courts have held that the MVRA third parties have the right to recover not only 
the losses suffered as a result of the wrongdoing, but also the costs associated with 
investigating the offense. Specifically, the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit agree that 
section 3663A(b)(4) of the MVRA provides for restitution of attorneys’ fees and certain out-of-pocket 
investigative expenses a victim company incurs as part of an internal investigation 
of suspected fraud.
