NATIONAL LICENSING SYSTEM FOR MORTGAGE LOAN OFFICERS  
In 2005, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and the American Association of 
Residential Mortgage Regulators (AARMR), along with state mortgage regulators, began 
creating a tool that would turn the table on criminals who exploit the complex mortgage 
origination system. State regulators agreed to a single set of uniform applications, including 
assigning a unique identifying number that tracks the entity or individual from state to state 
and over time. The resulting system—the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System 
(NMLS) — offers the industry a single location for ascertaining license status and finding any 
enforcement actions. The system began operating on January 2, 2008; by the end of 2010, 49 
of the U.S. states, as well as Puerto Rico, will have implemented use of the NMLS for 
mortgage licensing.
