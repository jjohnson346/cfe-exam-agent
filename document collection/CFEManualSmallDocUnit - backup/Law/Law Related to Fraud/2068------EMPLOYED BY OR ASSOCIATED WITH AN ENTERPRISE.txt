EMPLOYED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH AN ENTERPRISE 
Under this element, the government must show that the defendant was directly involved in 
the management of the enterprise as an employee, officer, director, owner, or other person 
with substantial management authority. An outside consultant, accountant, or attorney who 
does not have substantial management authority is not liable. 
 
An enterprise includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association or other legal 
entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact, although not a legal entity. 
The enterprise should be an entity distinct from the “person” or “persons” who violate the 
statute. An enterprise includes both a legitimate and an illegal organization.
