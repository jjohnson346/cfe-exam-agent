Employees of Defense Contractors (10 U.S.C. § 2409) 
Section 2409 of Title 10, U. S. Code, provides a measure of protection to employees of 
Defense contractors who report violations of laws or regulations relating to defense 
contracts. Under section 2409, an employee of a contractor may not be discharged, demoted, 
or discriminated against for reporting violations of law related to a contract awarded by the 
head of certain federal agencies (i.e., Department of Defense or Department of the Army). A 
person may submit a complaint to the Inspector General (IG) of the contracting agency. If 
an employee does not receive relief through the IG/agency head route, which is generally 
required within 180 days, the employee may bring a claim in federal court. Section 2409 does 
not contain any statute of limitations, and under a successful section 2409 claim, employees 
are entitled to reinstatement, compensatory damages, including back pay, and all costs and 
expenses, including attorneys’ fees, reasonably incurred by the employee in bringing the 
complaint.
