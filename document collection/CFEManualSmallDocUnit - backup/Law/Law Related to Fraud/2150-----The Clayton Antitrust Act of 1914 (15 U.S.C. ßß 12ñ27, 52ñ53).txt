The Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 (15 U.S.C. §§ 12–27, 52–53)  
Enacted as an amendment to the Sherman Antitrust Act, which was designed to combat 
anticompetitive practices, the Clayton Antitrust Act prohibits certain antitrust activities, 
including a prohibition on anticompetitive price discrimination and a prohibition against 
certain exclusive dealing practices. 
 
The Clayton Antitrust Act permits private parties injured by an antitrust violation to sue in 
federal court for three times their actual damages plus court costs and attorneys’ fees, and it 
authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil suits on behalf of injured consumers in their 
states. 
 
If successful, the plaintiff may recover damages of up to three times the actual loss incurred. 
The plaintiff need not prove the exact amount of damages sustained. A reasonable

approximation, based on the best evidence available, is sufficient. The court can award 
interest for the period of the lawsuit if it finds that the defendant unreasonably delayed the 
proceedings. A foreign country plaintiff may be limited to actual damages. 
 
A criminal prosecution for antitrust violations can be brought in addition to a civil action for 
the same conduct. The court may regulate such “parallel proceedings” to prevent undue 
prejudice to the defendant, and may stay (delay) the civil case or discovery in the case until 
the criminal prosecution is completed. A previous criminal conviction of the defendant 
involving the same facts and parties may be admissible to prove liability in a civil action, 
leaving only the amount of the damages to prove. 
 
To recover damages under this Act, the plaintiff must be a person, which includes any 
individual, business, or state government capable of holding a property interest, and the 
plaintiff must establish that his business or property was injured by an antitrust violation 
(e.g., agreement to fix prices, collusive bidding, dividing markets, price discrimination, 
predatory pricing, group boycotts or concerted refusals to deal, or commercial bribery).
