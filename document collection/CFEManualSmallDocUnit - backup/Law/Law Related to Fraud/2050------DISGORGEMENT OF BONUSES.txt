DISGORGEMENT OF BONUSES 
One of the most unique aspects of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is section 304, which states that 
if a publicly traded company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the 
company’s material noncompliance (as a result of “misconduct”) with any financial reporting 
requirement under securities laws, then the CEO and CFO must reimburse the company for: 
• Any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation received during the 
12 months after the initial filing of the report that requires restating; and  
• Any profits realized from the sale of the company’s securities during the same 12-month 
period. 
 
While the Act requires the CEO and CFO to disgorge their bonuses if the company’s 
financial statements have to be restated because of “misconduct,” it makes no mention of 
whose misconduct triggers this provision. There is certainly nothing in the text of Sarbanes-
 Oxley section 304 that limits the disgorgement provision to instances of misconduct by the 
CEO and CFO. Presumably, then, the CEO and CFO could be required to disgorge their 
bonuses and profits from the sale of company stock even if they had no knowledge of and 
took no part in the misconduct that made the restatement necessary.
