Larceny 
Larceny is defined as the unlawful taking of money or property of another with the intent to 
convert or to deprive the owner. Unlike in embezzlement, in larceny the defendant never has 
lawful possession of the property, but may have mere custody of it (e.g., a cashier has 
custody, not possession, of money in a register). The elements of larceny typically include: 
• Unlawfully taking or carrying away 
• Money or property of another 
• Without the consent of the owner 
• With the intent to permanently deprive the owner of its use or possession
