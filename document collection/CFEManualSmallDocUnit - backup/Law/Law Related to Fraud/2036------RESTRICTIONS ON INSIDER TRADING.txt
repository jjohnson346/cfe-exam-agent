requirements of blackout period notices that must be provided to directors and officers. 
Reports of changes in beneficial ownership by these persons must now be filed with the 
SEC by the end of the second business day following the transaction. 
 
Under Sarbanes-Oxley section 306, directors and officers are also prohibited from trading in 
the company’s securities during any pension fund blackout periods. This restriction only 
applies to securities that were acquired because of their employment or service to the 
company. A blackout period is defined as any period of more than three consecutive 
business days in which at least 50 percent of the participants in the company’s retirement 
plan are restricted from trading in the company’s securities. If a director or officer violates 
this provision, he can be forced to disgorge to the company all profits received from the sale 
of securities during the blackout period.
