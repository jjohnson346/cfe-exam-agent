The Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act passed in June 2002 made a number of important changes to 
securities law. One of the most significant changes was the addition of a criminal offense 
under section 807 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 13 48).  Section 1348 provides for fines up to 
$250,000, imprisonment for up to 25 years, or both.  
 
The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA), signed into law by President 
Obama on May 20, 2009, contains a number of measures intended to combat fraud. Among 
other provisions, the legislation expands the definition of securities fraud in section 1348 to 
include fraud schemes involving commodities for future delivery or options on commodities 
for future delivery.
