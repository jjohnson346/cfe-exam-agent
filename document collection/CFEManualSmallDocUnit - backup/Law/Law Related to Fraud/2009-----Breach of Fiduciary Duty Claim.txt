Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claim 
A breach of fiduciary duty claim is a civil action. The plaintiff may receive damages for lost 
profits and recover profits that the disloyal employee earned—in some instances even the 
salary paid to the employee or agent during the period of disloyalty. The plaintiff may 
recover profits earned by the disloyal agent even if the principal did not suffer an actual loss.
