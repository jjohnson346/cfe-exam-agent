Perjury 
Perjury (18 U.S.C. §§ 1621 and 1623)  is an intentional false statement given under oath on a 
material point. Under a related federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1623, the government may allege 
and prove perjury if the defendant makes two irreconcilable contradictory statements 
without proving which is true and which is false. False and fraudulent statements — orally or 
in writing — made to a government agency on a material matter also may be punished as a 
felony under a variety of statutes even if not given under oath.
