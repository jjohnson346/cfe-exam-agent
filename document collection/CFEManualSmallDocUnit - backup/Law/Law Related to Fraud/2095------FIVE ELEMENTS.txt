FIVE ELEMENTS  
There are five elements to a violation: (1) regulated party, (2) payment or offer, (3) foreign 
official, (4) corrupt intent, and (5) business purpose.  
 
First, under the FCPA, U.S. jurisdiction over corrupt payments to foreign officials depends 
upon whether the violator is a regulated party. Regulated persons include all of the following: 
• A domestic concern : Any citizen, national, or resident of the United States, or any business 
entity that has its principal place of business in the United States or that is organized 
under the laws of a state, territory, possession, or commonwealth of the United States 
• Issuer : A corporation that has issued securities that have been registered in the United 
States or who is required to file periodic reports with the SEC 
• The agents or other representatives of domestic concerns and issuers

• A foreign national or business that takes any act in furtherance of a corrupt payment 
within U.S. territory 
 
Second, the FCPA prohibits paying, offering, promising to pay, or authorizing to pay or 
offer money or anything of value. Under the FCPA, payments can include payments of 
money, gifts, charitable contributions or donation of benefit to foreign official, in-kind 
service, scholarship to foreign official’s relative, overpayments for shares, and loans at 
favorable interest rates. 
 
Third, the prohibition extends only to corrupt payments to a foreign official. The term 
foreign official is very broad and includes: 
• Any foreign department, instrumentality, or agency 
• Any entity owned or controlled by a foreign government 
• Any official or candidate of a foreign political party 
• Any public international organization  
• Any person acting in an official capacity on behalf of any of the above entities 
 
Fourth, the person making or authorizing the payment must have a corrupt intent. That is, 
the payment must be intended to influence the recipient to misuse his position.  
 
Finally, the payment must be related to a specific business purpose. Put differently, the 
payments must be related to obtaining business, retaining business, or directing business. 
The prohibition also covers payments to gain favorable tax or customs treatment or to 
obtain permits or licenses.
