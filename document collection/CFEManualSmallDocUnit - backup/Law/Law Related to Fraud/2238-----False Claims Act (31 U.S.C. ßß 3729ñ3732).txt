False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–3732) 
To counteract fraudulent billings turned in to the federal government, the False Claims Act 
(FCA) allows private individuals, on behalf of the federal government, to bring claims 
against federal contractors for committing fraud against the government. The FCA contains 
an anti-retaliation provision under Title 31 U.S.C. section 3730(h), which prohibits an 
employer from taking any adverse action (including discharge, demotion, or harassment) 
against an employee “because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the 
employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section, including the investigation 
or initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this 
section.” Federal courts have jurisdiction for section 3730(h) claims, and since section 
3730(h) does not contain any statute of limitations, courts generally borrow the most closely 
analogous state limitations period, which begins tolling when the cause of action accrued. 
 
If an employer takes adverse action against the employee, the employee can seek relief 
against the employer, including reinstatement at the same seniority status, an award of two 
times the employee’s back pay plus interest, and any other special damages required to make 
the employee whole. The employee also can receive reimbursement for all the costs of the 
litigation, including attorneys’ fees. 
 
The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act (FERA), a recently enacted law designed to 
combat fraud, makes significant changes to the False Claims Act. Among other significant 
changes, FERA expanded the anti-retaliation protections under the False Claims Act by 
making these retaliation claims available to government contractors and agents.
