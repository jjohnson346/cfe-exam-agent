MORTGAGE LENDERS  
Today, the secondary market has overtaken deposit gathering as the source of funding for 
mortgage lending. Loans are sold in the secondary market at origination, thereby providing 
the bank with a steady supply of capital needed to make additional loans. Without the need 
for a lot of capital (deposits on the books), mortgage lenders started to evolve.

Consequently, a smaller percentage of bankers are keeping their loans than in the past. Even 
large commercial banks with lending authority and capital now sell the mortgage loan 
transactions they originate and close. Few banks wish to rely on depositors’ money to fund 
mortgage loans.  
 
Additionally, many mortgage lenders are non-depository institutions rather than locally 
headquartered depository banks. Mortgage lenders do not take deposits. Instead they rely on 
the stability the secondary market has provided to purchase loans at origination, and to repay 
the bank monies to use for future mortgage loan originations.
