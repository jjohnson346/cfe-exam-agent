PRIVATE HEALTH INFORMATION 
In addition, certain businesses may need to consider adopting a set of policies and 
procedures to safeguard private health information, which includes any identifiable 
information that relates to a patient’s health, health care, or payment for health care. Federal 
privacy protections for consumers’ health care information are primarily located in the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information 
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act).
