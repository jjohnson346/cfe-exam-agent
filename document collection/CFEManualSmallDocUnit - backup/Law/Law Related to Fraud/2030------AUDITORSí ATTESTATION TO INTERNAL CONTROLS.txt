AUDITORS’ ATTESTATION TO INTERNAL CONTROLS 
As was stated previously, section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires every annual report 
to contain an internal control report which states that the company’s management is 
responsible for internal controls, and which also assesses the effectiveness of the internal 
control structures. Sarbanes-Oxley section 404 requires the company’s external auditors to 
attest to and issue a report on management’s assessment of internal controls.
