Data Breaches and Breach Notification Laws 
Businesses with inadequate security safeguards not only leave customers’ confidential data 
vulnerable to misuse or theft, but also increase their risk of regulatory or legal action, direct 
economic loss, and loss of consumer confidence. 
 
EXAMPLE  
In September 2009, TJX Companies (the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, 
HomeGoods, and other enterprises) agreed to pay $525,000 to settle a class-action suit filed by 
several banks related to the data breach of its computer system in which hackers compromised 
94 million credit and debit card numbers. According to investigations, inadequate security 
safeguards allowed hackers to access and steal this information. This settlement is one of several 
for TJX, which has estimated that it will spend more than $250 million to address network-security 
weaknesses and respond to lawsuits, investigations, and other claims stemming from the 
breach. 
 
EXAMPLE  
On November 20, 2009, the Hartford Courant reported that Health Net, a health insurance 
provider, lost a portable, external hard drive with unencrypted personal information of 
approximately 1.5 million customers. The missing data included Social Security numbers and 
bank account numbers of Health Net members in Arizona, Connecticut, New Jersey, and 
New York. Although the hard drive reportedly disappeared from Health Net’s office in May 
2009, the company waited six months before disclosing the breach. According to the 
Connecticut Attorney General, Health Net may be in violation of state notification laws that 
require companies to inform consumers of data breaches without unreasonable delay.

Data breaches are one of the largest contributors to the escalating problem of identity theft, 
which costs Americans more than $50 billion each year. In fact, the Identity Theft Resource 
Center, a nonprofit organization dedicated to understanding and preventing identity theft, 
estimates that in 2008, data breaches left more than 35 million personal records exposed. 
 
Although these cases and statistics illustrate why strengthening information-security practices 
should become a high priority for management in all types of organizations, complying with 
U.S. privacy laws and regulations is becoming increasingly complex. This is primarily because 
the United States uses a sectoral approach to protect information. This approach, which 
relies on a mix of legislation, regulation, and self-regulation, creates a system in which 
privacy standards emerge from a complex interplay of overlapping state and federal laws and 
regulations, as well as industry practices.  
 
In addition to a complex regulatory framework, organizations across various industries have 
experienced a significant increase in the number of information privacy laws and regulations 
affecting their operations. Particularly due to an onslaught of data-breach stories like the 
ones above, concerns about the privacy of personal information have escalated, and this has 
compelled government authorities to enact stronger consumer-protection legislation and 
enhance enforcement efforts to identify and prosecute violations of laws protecting private-
 consumer information. 
 
Although businesses have become subject to a growing number of privacy laws and 
regulations, information-privacy regulation in the United States is more prevalent in areas 
where abuses of personal information are most likely to occur, such as the financial and 
health care industries.  
 
This increasingly complex area of law poses significant compliance challenges for 
organizations operating in regulated industries. In this environment, management must 
understand the complicated and expanding area of privacy law and continually work to 
ensure that their organizations have and follow appropriate procedures and protocols 
addressing information privacy. 
 
This section seeks to provide a general overview on the subject by briefly examining some 
important laws, regulations, and standards designed to protect the privacy, security, and 
confidentiality of customer data. The discussion below is divided into the following

categories: financial privacy, private health in formation, and privacy protections applying to 
businesses in other industries.
