MAJOR FRAUD ACT OF 1988 (18 U.S.C. § 1031) 
The Major Fraud Act prohibits any scheme to de fraud the United States or obtain money or 
property from the United States by means of false or fraudulent pretenses involving 
procurement contracts worth $1 million or more.  
 
To establish a claim under the Major Fraud Act, the government must show the following 
elements:  
• The defendant knowingly executed or attempted to execute 
• Any scheme or artifice  
• With the intent to defraud the United States or to obtain money by false pretenses

2.274  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• On a contract with the United States valued at $1 million or more 
 
The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA), signed into law by President 
Obama on May 20, 2009, contains a number of measures intended to combat fraud. Among 
other significant changes, FERA amends section 1031 to cover fraud in connection with 
funds provided under the Troubled Asset Relief Program and other governmental economic 
stimulus or recovery programs.  
 
If convicted, the defendant may be imprisoned for up to 10 years and fined up to $10 
million or twice the amount of the gross loss or gain involved in the offense. The statute 
contains a special seven-year statute of limitations compared to the normal five-year statute 
applicable to federal crimes. 
 
The statute also contains a whistleblower protection clause. This clause provides that any 
individual who is discharged, demoted, harassed, or otherwise mistreated as a result of the 
individual’s cooperation in the prosecution of offenses under this section may obtain 
reinstatement, two times the amount of back pay due, and other damages, including litigation 
costs and attorney’s fees. 
 
Another provision authorizes the attorney general to pay up to $250,000 in certain 
circumstances for information regarding possible prosecutions under this section. This and 
the whistleblower provisions do not apply to people who participated in the offense.
