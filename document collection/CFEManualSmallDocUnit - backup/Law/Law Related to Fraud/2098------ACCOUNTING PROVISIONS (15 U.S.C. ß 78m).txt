ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS (15 U.S.C. § 78m) 
In addition to outlawing bribery payments, the FCPA also contains separate accounting 
provisions for certain entities already subject to the FCPA provisions. Congress enacted the 
FCPA’s accounting provisions as an additional deterrent to bribery based on its conclusion 
that U.S. companies concealed most bribes in their corporate books.  
 
Under the accounting provisions, issuers (i.e., companies with securities listed in the U.S. 
trading markets) must (1) maintain accurate books and records, and (2) adopt internal 
controls to prevent the improper use of corporate funds. 
 
In addition, the FCPA requires that a covered entity make a good-faith effort to ensure that 
any company, including joint ventures, in which the U.S. company or one of its subsidiaries 
holds 50 percent or less of the voting power comply with the FCPA accounting provisions.
