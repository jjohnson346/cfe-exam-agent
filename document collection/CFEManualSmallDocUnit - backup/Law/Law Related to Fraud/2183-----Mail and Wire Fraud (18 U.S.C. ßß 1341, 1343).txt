Mail and Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343) 
As noted above, a computer may be the tool used to commit traditional crimes, including 
mail and wire fraud. Due to the broad reach of the mail and wire fraud statutes, prosecutors 
may use these traditional criminal statutes to prosecute computer fraud. In basic terms, the 
laws prohibit the use of mail or wires, including the Internet, in furtherance of a fraudulent 
scheme designed to obtain money or property. In fact, several cases have held that the 
federal mail and wire fraud statues apply to computer fraud.
