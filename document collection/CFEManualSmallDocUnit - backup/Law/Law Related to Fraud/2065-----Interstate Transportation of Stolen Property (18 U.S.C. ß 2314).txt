Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property (18 U.S.C. § 2314) 
Section 2314 of Title 18, U.S. Code, regulates interstate transportation of stolen property. 
Popularly known as ITSP, section 2314 is often used in fraud prosecutions in conjunction 
with mail or wire fraud counts, or to provide federal jurisdiction in their absence when 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law

proceeds of a value of $5,000 or more obtained by fraud are transported across state lines. 
The statute also is violated if a defendant induces the victim to travel in interstate commerce 
as part of the scheme to defraud. Individual transportation of money or other items valued 
at less than $5,000 as part of the same sc heme may be aggregated to meet the value 
requirement. 
 
Also, prosecutors have attempted to charge defendants in violation of the ITSP statute in 
addition to or in lieu of the theft of commercial trade secrets or the theft of other 
proprietary information charges. It is clear that section 2314 applies when defendants steal 
tangible items, which qualify as goods, wares, or merchandise, that contain intellectual 
property. However, courts have had varying opinions on the characterization of intellectual 
property as “goods, wares, merchandise, securities, or money” when an individual steals 
intangible property through intangible means. For example, in United States v. Brown, 925 F.2d 
1301 (10th Cir. 1991), the Tenth Circuit held that the theft of intellectual property through 
intangible means does not implicate section 2314. Alternatively, the courts in United States v. 
Riggs, 739 F.Supp. 414 (N.D. Ill. 1990) and United States v. Farraj, 142 F. Supp. 2d 484 
(S.D.N.Y. 2001) reached the opposite result.  
 
Even though prosecutors may use the ITSP to prosecute theft of commercial trade secrets, 
proprietary information, or other types of intellectual property in certain situations, they 
cannot use the ITSP to prosecute copyright infringement cases unless the infringement 
involves the theft of a tangible piece of hardware. 
 
Finally, when patent infringement is the only theory for an individual to steal a piece of 
property, the ITSP does not allow prosecution for interstate transportation of patent-
 infringing goods.
