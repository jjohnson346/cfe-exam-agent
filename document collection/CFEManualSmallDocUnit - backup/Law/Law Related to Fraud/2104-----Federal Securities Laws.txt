Federal Securities Laws 
Because of several high profile corporate scandals in 2001 and 2002, Congress passed the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was discussed previously in this chapter. In addition to the 
numerous reporting and certification requirements for financial statements, the Act also 
created a criminal statute relating to securities fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1348) set forth below. In 
addition to this statute, there are also numerous other federal statutes which prohibit false 
statements and other fraudulent activity in connection with securities transactions. The most 
commonly used are section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (popularly known as the 1933 
Act) and Rule 10b-5, promulgated under section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (the 1934 Act). Both contain civil and administrative remedies (such as the power to 
initiate actions to enjoin further violations) enforced by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC), as well as criminal sanctions enforced by the Department of Justice 
(DOJ). Whether a particular violation is pros ecuted civilly or criminally depends in large 
measure on the degree of willfulness that can be proved.
