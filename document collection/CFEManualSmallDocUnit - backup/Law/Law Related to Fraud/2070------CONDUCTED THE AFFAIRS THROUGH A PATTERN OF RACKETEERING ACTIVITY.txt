CONDUCTED THE AFFAIRS THROUGH A PATTERN OF RACKETEERING ACTIVITY 
The defendant violates this element if he has some involvement in the management or 
operation of the enterprise and in the commission of two or more “racketeering offenses” 
through the enterprise. The term racketeering activity  includes a broad assortment of state and 
federal crimes, such as bribery, extortion, bankruptcy fraud, mail fraud, and securities fraud. 
 
Pattern means at least two acts of racketeering activity, the last of which occurred within 10 
years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after a prior act. Proof of a pattern requires 
that the acts be connected in some manner and not be separate, isolated, or random crimes. 
Each act must have “continuity plus relationship,” that is, the same or a similar purpose, 
result, participants, victims, methods of commission, or be otherwise related.
