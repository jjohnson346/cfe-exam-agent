Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) (12 U.S.C. § 1811, et. seq.) 
Following the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, Congress passed the Financial Institutions 
Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) to enhance the safety of savings 
institutions. Among other things, FIRREA greatly strengthened the government’s 
prosecutorial arm against insiders and outsiders. The law’s provisions are applicable to any 
institution-affiliated party, which includes (but is not limited to) directors, officers, 
employees, and controlling shareholders. Institution-affiliated parties can include attorneys, 
accountants, and appraisers. 
 
FIRREA provides for enhanced penalties for convictions of several bank-related statutes. 
Under FIRREA, civil penalties range from $1 million per day, a total of $5 million for 
continuing violations, or the amount of wrongful gain or loss.
