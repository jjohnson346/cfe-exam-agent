includes all surprise, trick, cunning or dissembling, and any unfair way by which another is 
cheated. 
  
Put more succinctly, fraud includes any intentional or deliberate act to deprive another of 
property or money by guile, deception, or other unfair means.

• Misrepresentation of material facts 
• Concealment of material facts 
• Bribery 
• Extortion 
• Conflicts of interest 
• Forgery 
• Theft of money or property
