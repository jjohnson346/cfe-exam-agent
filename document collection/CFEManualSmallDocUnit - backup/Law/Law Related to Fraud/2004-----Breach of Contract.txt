Breach of Contract 
If the fraudster has any kind of a contractual relationship with the victim, there may also be a 
breach of contract claim. Any non-performance of a contractual obligation or an announcement 
that a party cannot or will not perform constitutes a breach. In other words, a breach of 
contract occurs when one party fails to perform, or announces that it does not intend to 
perform, without just cause.  
 
A breach of contract claim can arise under an oral or written contract. Many states have 
recognized certain implied or unwritten duties as a part of almost every contract. For 
instance, some courts have held that it is an implicit part of a contract that each party will 
use their best efforts to fulfill their duties under the contract. A similar duty that has been 
recognized by some states is the duty to deal with each other in good faith. If a party to a 
contract, which includes an employment contract, steals from the other party or acts in bad 
faith, there may be a civil claim for breach of contract.
