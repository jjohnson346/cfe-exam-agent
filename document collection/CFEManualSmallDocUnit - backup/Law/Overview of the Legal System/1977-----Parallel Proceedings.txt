Parallel Proceedings 
Parallel proceedings are simultaneous criminal and civil actions against the same defendant that 
are based upon a single set of facts. The general rule is that criminal and civil actions for fraud 
may proceed simultaneously even though such “parallel proceedings” present a dilemma for 
the defendant. For example, a defendant lawfully may assert his Fifth Amendment right 
against self-incrimination to avoid answering questions or producing certain documents in the 
criminal investigation. He may not do so in the corresponding civil case, however, without 
suffering the possibility of sanctions that can include the dismissal of affirmative defenses or 
the striking of testimony. For example, if a defendant takes the stand in a civil case and 
testifies on his own behalf, he cannot later invoke the Fifth Amendment and refuse to answer 
questions concerning the same subject matter on cross-examination. If he does, the judge 
may order that his testimony on direct examination be stricken from the record. 
 
Generally, courts have not been sympathetic to the defendant’s dilemma and have allowed 
civil discovery to proceed even though criminal charges are pending. In some instances, the 
court or the parties may seal the civil record by agreement. In rare cases, the court may order 
that the civil case be stayed pending resolution of the criminal case. Normally, however, the 
court will allow the cases to proceed simultaneously despite the substantial prejudice to the 
defendant. In parallel civil and criminal cases in which the government is a party, the criminal 
process, including the use of grand jury subpoenas, may not be used to obtain evidence solely 
for a civil case.
