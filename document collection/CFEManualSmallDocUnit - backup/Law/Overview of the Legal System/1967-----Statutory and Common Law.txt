Statutory and Common Law 
There are two sources of substantive law: statutory law and common law. Statutory law  
includes statutes passed by the federal or state legislatures (and regulations passed by 
administrative bodies). The common law consists of the usages and customs of a society as 
interpreted by the judiciary; it often is referred to as “judge-made” law. Criminal law is 
statutory, while civil actions can be based on either statutory or common law. 
 
Although criminal fraud statutes outlaw certain behavior, they often contain provisions that 
do not have any obvious connection to basic principles of right and wrong. For example, a 
violation of the federal mail fraud statute can be charged only if the wrongdoers placed or 
received a letter in the U.S. mail, regardless of how serious the underlying fraud might be. 
Similarly, defendants are liable under the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations 
(RICO) statute only if they engage “in a pattern of racketeering activity” through “an

enterprise” that is engaged in interstate commerce, while violations of the federal money 
laundering statute occur only if the defendants have engaged in “specified unlawful activity” 
and have thereafter conducted a “prohibited financial transaction.” Certified Fraud 
Examiners preparing criminal cases must be familiar with the specific technical elements of 
the applicable statutes, and they must carefully review the evidence to make certain that all 
essential elements of proof are met. 
 
In contrast to criminal fraud statutes, civil cases brought under the common law usually 
contain fewer technical elements and incorporate traditional principles of fairness and 
morality. For example, a plaintiff may file a common law claim for fraud by alleging simply 
that the defendant misrepresented important facts upon which the plaintiff relied, resulting in 
loss to the plaintiff.  
 
The common law is based not on statutes passed by the legislatures, but upon “precedent” 
established by previously decided cases stretching back hundreds of years in U.S. and English 
courts. That is, decisions that establish particular legal principles are called precedent, and in a 
common law system, the decision in an individual case binds judges in later cases of a similar 
nature, until or unless the rule of law established is overturned by a higher court or the 
legislature. The body of judicial opinions is sometimes referred to as case law. There are an 
increasing number of civil statutes in the fraud area, including the federal Civil RICO and 
Civil False Claims statutes.
