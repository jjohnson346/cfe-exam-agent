Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress 
Intentional infliction of emotional distress refers to any unprivileged conduct that is so 
outrageous and egregious that it exceeds all bounds usually tolerated by civilized society and 
that is intended to cause injury (or was committed with reckless disregard for the likelihood 
of its causing injury) to another.  
 
For an employee to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, he must 
establish all of the following elements: 
• The employer engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct 
• The employer’s conduct was intended to cause severe emotional distress (or, if not 
intended, would cause severe emotional distress in a reasonable person) 
• The employee actually did suffer emotional or mental distress as a result of the 
employer’s conduct 
 
It is not enough that the employee is merely “upset” by the conduct. For example, 
questioning alone, even coupled with accusations and raised voices, probably will not give 
rise to such a claim.
