Monitoring Employees’ Internet Activity 
As with monitoring employees’ e-mail and blogging activity, employers should be aware of 
federal protections against monitoring employees’ Internet use, including an employee’s 
instant messages, website postings, etc. This is true even though federal law provides 
employees little protection from an employer’s electronic monitoring. For example, although 
the ECPA prohibits the intentional interception of electronic communications when 
employees have a reasonable expectation of privacy, an employer may monitor Internet use 
when there is employee consent, when there are legitimate business purposes, or when an 
employer has reason to believe that the company’s interests are at risk. In addition, the 
common law right to privacy also extends to employees in the workplace; however, the 
public nature of the workplace has led many courts to reject most invasion claims on the 
basis that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy.
