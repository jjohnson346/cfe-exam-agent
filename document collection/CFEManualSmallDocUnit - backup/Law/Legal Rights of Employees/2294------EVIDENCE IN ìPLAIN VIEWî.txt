EVIDENCE IN “PLAIN VIEW” 
Evidence in “plain view” of an officer who has a right to be in a position to observe it also 
may be seized without a warrant. This situation usually occurs when contraband or evidence 
of another crime is inadvertently discovered during a search or arrest for another offense. 
The discovery must be truly inadvertent; however, if discovery of the evidence is anticipated 
and no other exception applies, a warrant must first be obtained.
