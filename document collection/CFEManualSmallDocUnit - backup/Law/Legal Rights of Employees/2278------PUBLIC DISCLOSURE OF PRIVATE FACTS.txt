PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE FACTS 
The tort of public disclosure of private facts occurs when one party makes public statements 
about another party’s private life that are not of public concern. For instance, disclosing 
information obtained in an interview to individuals not involved in the investigation. 
 
Unlike defamation claims, which are discussed below, this cause of action can arise even if 
the statements are true. The key is that the information is private in nature and it is not a 
matter of public interest.
