Fair Credit Reporting Act 
One of the primary statutes limiting access to information is the federal Fair Credit 
Reporting Act (FCRA). This statute regulates the dissemination of consumer information to 
third parties by consumer reporting agencies. Historically, the FCRA only applied to 
consumer credit reports, but due to amendments in 1997, the FCRA now applies to the 
gathering of many other types of information about an individual through third parties.  
 
The FCRA prohibits consumer reporting agencies from releasing personal information 
about an individual (e.g., information about the consumer’s character, general reputation, 
personal characteristics, or mode of living) to third parties without authorization, and limits 
disclosure of credit information to third parties with a purpose permitted by the statute. 
 
The FCRA applies in the employment context when an employer contracts with a third party 
(e.g., a private investigator or an online public records service) to collect credit information 
on current or potential employees. The FCRA, however, does not apply if the person or 
organization seeking the information gathers it directly from the source.  
 
If the FCRA does apply, it generally means that an examiner cannot use a third party to 
obtain certain information about a person unless that person has received certain notices and 
signed a consent form. The failure to do so can mean civil penalties.
