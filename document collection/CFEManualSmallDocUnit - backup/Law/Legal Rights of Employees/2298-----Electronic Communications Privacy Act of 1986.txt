Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986   
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA), codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 
2510–2521, 2701–2710, 3121–3126, is the primary federal statute that offers workers 
protections in communications privacy. 
 
Under the ECPA, electronic communications are defined as “any transfer of signs, signals,

writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by 
a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photolectronic, or photooptical system that affects 
interstate or foreign commerce.” 
 
The ECPA is divided into three parts: the Wiretap Act, which governs the interception of 
electronic communications, the Stored Communications Act, which covers access to stored 
communications and records; and the Pen Regis ter Act, which regulates pen registers and 
trap and trace devices.  
 
THE WIRETAP ACT (18 U.S.C. §§ 2510–2521) 
In response to an increasing number of privacy breaches, Congress enacted the Wiretap Act, 
which prohibits anyone from intentionally intercepting or attempting to intercept any wire, 
oral, or electronic communication.  
 
Section 2511 prohibits covert spying on voice and data communications, extending 
protection from eavesdropping on mail and telephone communications to include digital 
data communications, such as e-mail and remote computing; it does not govern stored 
communications. Under the Wiretap Act, an interception occurs by the acquisition of the 
contents of any electronic communication through the use of any device. Most courts have 
held that interception occurs only when the protected communications are obtained 
contemporaneously with their transmission.  
 
Remedies for violating the Wiretap Act include criminal sanctions and civil relief. A criminal 
violation under the Act is a felony and is punishable by up to five years imprisonment 
and/or fines. Under a private cause of action, a court may award the plaintiff equitable relief, 
actual damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees.
