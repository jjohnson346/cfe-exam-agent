COMPLYING WITH THE FCRA 
Before employers can get a consumer report about a current or prospective employee, they 
must comply with certain requirements; however, employers that are gathering such 
information in connection with a workplace investigation of misconduct may be excluded 
from the FCRA (see the section “Workplace Investigations of Fraud and Misconduct” 
below).  
 
  
Law  Individual Rights During Examinations 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.441 
If the FCRA applies, the party seeking the information must comply with the following 
requirements:  
• Inform the consumer reporting agency that it will follow the FCRA. 
• Provide the individual with a separate written disclosure.  
• Obtain the individual’s written authorization.  
 
The disclosure and the authorization can be contained in the same document. 
 
If, however, an employer relies on a consumer report for an “adverse action” (e.g., denying a 
job application, reassigning or terminating an employee, or denying a promotion), it must 
provide the individual with a pre-adverse action disclosure before taking the adverse action. 
This disclosure must include a copy of the individual’s consumer report and a copy of “A 
Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act,” which is available from the FTC. 
 
After adverse action is taken, the employer must notify the individual via an adverse action 
notice that the action has been taken. That notice must include the following: 
• Name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting agency (CRA) that 
supplied the report 
• A statement that the CRA did not make the adverse action decision and cannot explain 
why the adverse action was taken 
• A notice of the individual’s right to di spute the accuracy or completeness of the 
information furnished, and his right to an additional free consumer report from the 
agency upon request within 60 days
