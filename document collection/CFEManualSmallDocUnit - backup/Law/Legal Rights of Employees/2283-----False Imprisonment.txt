False Imprisonment 
False imprisonment is restraint by one person of the physical liberty of another without consent 
or legal justification. A claim of false imprisonment might be made if an employee is 
detained in any way during a search either of the employee or of the employee’s desk, locker, 
etc. Generally, an employer is entitled to question an employee at work about a violation of 
company policy without incurring liability as long as the employee submits to the 
questioning voluntarily; that is, not as a result of threats or force. However, the length, 
nature, and manner of the interview will determine whether liability arises. 
 
False imprisonment factors include: 
• Size and nature of the room where an interview takes place (small, windowless, not easily 
accessible is a negative) 
• Lighting in room—soft versus severe 
• Requiring the employee’s presence or continued presence by any amount of force, 
including holding the employee’s arm to escort him 
• Violent behavior of any kind during the in terview, including yelling, pounding on desks, 
or kicking furniture or walls 
• Refusing to allow the employee to leave the room, such as by pushing the employee into 
a chair or locking the door 
• The number of people involved in the interview
