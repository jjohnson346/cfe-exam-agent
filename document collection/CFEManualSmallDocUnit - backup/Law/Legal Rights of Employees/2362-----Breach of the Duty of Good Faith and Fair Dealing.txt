Breach of the Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing 
A few states recognize a duty on the part of the employer to deal with its employees fairly 
and in good faith. This duty is implied in most contracts, including contracts of employment. 
The scope of this duty might also be shaped from specific obligations found in the 
provisions of an employee handbook or from company personnel policies or practices. 
Documenting that the employer had good cause to terminate the employee should defeat 
this claim.
