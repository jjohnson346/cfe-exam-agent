Common Law Protections in Connection with Searches and Surveillance 
Employees also enjoy common law privacy protections that limit an employer’s right to 
search and use surveillance techniques. These common law rights apply to private as well as 
government employers; no state action is required to trigger their protections. 
 
Some of the common law protections that applied in the interview setting also apply to an 
employer’s right to search and use surveillance techniques.
