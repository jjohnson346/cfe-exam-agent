ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS EXCEPTION 
Under the ordinary course of business exception, employers are permitted to monitor their 
employees’ wire or electronic communications, including phone calls, if done for a legitimate 
business purpose.  
 
This exception could apply in various scenarios. For example, it would apply where the 
employer routinely monitors phone communications for purposes of quality control (e.g., 
monitoring the phone calls of operators, telemarketers, customer service personnel, etc.). It 
may also apply where there is a legitimate business purpose for the monitoring, such as 
preventing business losses or employee misconduct. Keep in mind, however, that there must 
be a specific, legitimate business purpose for the interception. Blanket monitoring probably 
will be found to violate the act. In Sanders v. Robert Bosch, 38 F.3d 736 (4th Cir. 1994), an 
employer who used a “voice logger” to record all telephone conversations on certain 
company lines did not fall within the ordinary course of business exception because the 
employer was unable to state a legitimate business purpose for the interceptions.  
 
Even if a company has a legitimate business purpose for monitoring a phone call, the 
method used to intercept and monitor the call must be no more intrusive than necessary to 
achieve the purpose. In Deal v. Spears, 980 F.2d 1153 (8th Cir. 1992), an employer who tape-
 recorded and listened to all calls, including personal calls, was found to have violated the 
statute even though the employer had legitimate suspicions of theft. Once it becomes

apparent that a communication is personal and not otherwise unauthorized, the employer 
must immediately stop listening to the call. Overly broad efforts to monitor employee calls 
may give rise to a claim for invasion of privacy.
