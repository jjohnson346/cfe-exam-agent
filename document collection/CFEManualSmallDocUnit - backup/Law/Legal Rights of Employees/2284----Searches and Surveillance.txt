Searches and Surveillance 
Workplace privacy is a rapidly evolving area of law that can arise in numerous contexts 
involving the employer-employee relationship, such as surveillance and monitoring, searches, 
and polygraph testing. In most cases, an employer might investigate its workplace for 
wrongdoing by means of workplace searches and surveillance of workplace areas or 
employees. However, an employee’s privacy may be protected by the Constitution, state 
constitutions, federal and state statutes, or common law limitations.
