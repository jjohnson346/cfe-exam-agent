The Exclusionary Rule 
Under the exclusionary rule, which is in effect in all federal and state courts, evidence seized in 
violation of the Fourth Amendment will be suppressed — that is, it becomes inadmissible in 
any prosecution against the suspect except under a few limited exceptions. In addition, all 
evidence that is obtained as a result of the illegally obtained evidence will also be excluded. 
An unlawful search and seizure does not mean the suspect cannot be prosecuted, and it does 
not invalidate a conviction based on other evidence. But it does prevent the wrongfully 
obtained evidence and all evidence derived from it from being presented at trial. 
 
Generally, this rule applies only in criminal cases and does not apply to private individuals 
acting for their own purposes. However, the Fourth Amendment does apply to government

employers. Therefore, a public employer cannot use illegally seized evidence to discipline an 
employee.  
 
There is, however, no Fourth Amendment prohibition against a private employer using 
illegally seized evidence to discipline an employee. Thus, evidence illegally obtained by a 
private employer may be admitted in court, but the employer might be exposing itself to 
litigation for invasion of privacy, trespass or other common law causes of action described 
below. 
 
Furthermore, evidence that has been suppressed under the exclusionary rule might still be 
admissible in a civil trial or an administrative proceeding such as an employee disciplinary 
hearing. The primary goal of the exclusionary rule is to deter police  misconduct. If the 
deterrent effect of excluding the evidence from a civil or administrative proceeding is 
outweighed by the costs that would result from excluding the evidence, and if the party 
whose rights were violated has other forms of redress for the violation, then evidence that 
was suppressed in a criminal trial may be admissible in a noncriminal proceeding. However, 
there are some circumstances in which wrongfully obtained evidence will be excluded from 
civil proceedings, so public employers should not feel free to disregard their employees’ 
constitutional rights under the assumption that any illegally obtained evidence can still be 
used against an employee in a noncriminal matter.
