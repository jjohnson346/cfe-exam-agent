Employee’s Right to Due Process 
The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees the right to due process: 
 
All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are 
citizens of the United States and of  the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce 
any law, which shall abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States; nor 
shall any state deprive any person of life, libert y, or property without due process of law; nor 
deny to any person within its jurisdict ion the equal protection of the laws … 
 
In the context of a fraud investigation, the constitutional right to due process usually refers 
to procedural rights that must be observed before the employee suffers any adverse 
consequence. Again, the right to due process usually is not applicable to employees of 
private companies. State or federal employers, however, might be required to provide the 
wrongdoing employee with the following: 
• Written notice of the charges 
• Adequate opportunity to rebut any charges brought prior to any disciplinary action being 
taken, which might include the right to call witnesses and the right to be represented by 
an attorney 
 
Even in the absence of constitutional due process protections, similar procedures to ensure 
fundamental fairness may be required even of private employers because of contractual 
provisions, collective bargaining agreements, established company policies, or applicable 
labor or employment statutes. Thus, private employers might also wish to employ the above 
procedures to avoid a possible civil suit by the employee.
