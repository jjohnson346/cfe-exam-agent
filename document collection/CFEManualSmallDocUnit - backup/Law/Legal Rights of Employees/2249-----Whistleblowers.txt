Whistleblowers 
Federal law and many state laws provide protection to employees who report improper or 
illegal acts to government authorities. Most of these laws protect the employee from any 
adverse employment action or retaliatory action from the employer. For more information 
on whistleblower laws, see the Federal “Whistleblower” Statutes section in the “The Law 
Related to Fraud (Part 2)” chapter above.
