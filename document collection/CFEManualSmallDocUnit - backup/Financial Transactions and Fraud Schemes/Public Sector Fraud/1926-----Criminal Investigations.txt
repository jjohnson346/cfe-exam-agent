Criminal Investigations 
If, on the other hand, the high government official is the subject of an actual or potential 
criminal investigation, a totally different situation arises. As noted above, a public employee 
cannot be compelled to cooperate or face loss of his job. The first step may well be 
attempting to secure the voluntary  cooperation of the individual with clear and full knowledge 
on his part of the possible consequences. Many agencies have developed their own wording, 
but the “Beckwith” or “Civiletti” warning is often used: 
 
You have the right to remain silent if your answers may tend to incriminate you. 
 
Anything you say may be used as evidence both in an administrative proceeding or any 
future criminal procee ding involving you. 
 
If you refuse to answer the questions posed to you on the grounds that the answers may 
incriminate you, you cannot be discharged solely for remaining silent. However, your silence 
can be considered in an administrative proceeding for its evidentiary value that is warranted 
by the facts surrounding your case. 
 
This warning clearly discloses its voluntary nature and the possible adverse consequences of 
cooperation. But in reality, adverse consequences for failing to cooperate under these 
circumstances are negligible.
