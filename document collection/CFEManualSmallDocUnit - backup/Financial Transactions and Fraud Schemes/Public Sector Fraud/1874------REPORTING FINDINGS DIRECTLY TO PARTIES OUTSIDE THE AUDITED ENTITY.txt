REPORTING FINDINGS DIRECTLY TO PARTIES OUTSIDE THE AUDITED ENTITY 
8.24 Auditors should report known or likely fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of 
contracts or grant agreements, or abuse directly to parties outside the audited entity 
in the following two circumstances. 
a. When entity management fails to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements to 
report such information to external parties specified in law or regulation, auditors 
should first communicate the failure to report such information to those charged 
with governance. If the audited entity still does not report this information to the

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1911 
specified external parties as soon as practicable after the auditors’ 
communication with those charged with governance, then the auditors should 
report the information directly to the specified external parties. 
b. When entity management fails to take timely and appropriate steps to respond to 
known or likely fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant 
agreements, or abuse that (1) is significant to the findings and conclusions, and 
(2) involves funding received directly or indirectly from a government agency, 
auditors should first report management’s failure to take timely and appropriate 
steps to those charged with governance. If the audited entity still does not take 
timely and appropriate steps as soon as practicable after the auditors’ 
communication with those charged with governance, then the auditors should 
report the entity’s failure to take timely and appropriate steps directly to the 
funding agency. 
8.25 The reporting in paragraph 8.24 is in addition to any legal requirements to report 
such information directly to parties outside the audited entity. Auditors should 
comply with these requirements even if they have resigned or been dismissed from 
the audit prior to its completion. 
8.26 Auditors should obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence, such as confirmation from 
outside parties, to corroborate assertions by management of the audited entity that it 
has reported such findings in accordance with laws, regulations, and funding 
agreements. When auditors are unable to do so, they should report such information 
directly as discussed in paragraph 8.24.
