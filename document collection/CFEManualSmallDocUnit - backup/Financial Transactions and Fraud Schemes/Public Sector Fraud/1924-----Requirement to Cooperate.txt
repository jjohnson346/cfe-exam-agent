Requirement to Cooperate
 
Employees must furnish testimony, or fully disclose information in their knowledge or 
possession, concerning any matter of official interest, to any federal court, board, panel, 
tribunal, agent, or official authorized to conduct a particular inquiry, investigation, hearing, 
trial or other proceeding, or to act upon such testimony or information, when directed to do 
so by proper authority. In this regard, employees must answer any proper questions, under 
oath or affirmation if required, including furnishing or authorizing the release of 
information related to their financial affairs, which has reasonable relationship to matters of 
official interest. 
 
An agency’s table of offenses and penalties then delineates the punishment for failure  
to cooperate. 
 
However, before these rules can be utilized in a case where the official is suspected of 
wrongdoing, a threshold determination of whether or not the violation is potentially criminal 
(and not whether a prosecutor would in fact accept it), must be made. If the allegation is 
inherently administrative, i.e., noncriminal, in nature, such as a misuse of vehicles or giving 
the appearance of a conflict of interest, the Fifth Amendment does not come into play and 
the official must cooperate in the same fashion as if he were a third-party witness. Instructive 
is the Merit Systems Protection Board’s 1981 decision in Ashford v. Bureau of Prisons, 6 MSPB 389, MSPR 458, 81 FMSR 7044.
