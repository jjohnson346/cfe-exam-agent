Social Security Frauds 
 
EXAMPLE 
An Indiana woman was sentenced to 5-1/2 years incarceration, suspended, ordered to 
make restitution of $40,800, and fined $10, 000 for concealing her mother’s death and 
forging and cashing her Social Security benefits checks. An out-of-state relative had told 
police it was difficult to believe that her mother, who was in her seventies, was always 
indisposed when they called. Police found the woman’s remains in a padlocked mobile home 
next to the woman’s house. 
 
EXAMPLE 
A Washington D.C. woman was found to have wrongfully converted 34 Social Security 
widow’s benefit checks made payable to her de ceased mother, thereby improperly receiving 
$13,400 from the Social Security Administration. Aggravating circumstances were found 
in that she wrongfully converted an additional 190 Social Security checks and attempted to 
conceal her misconduct by lying to the SSA field representative regarding the whereabouts of 
her deceased mother. The Administrative Law Judge found that the woman was liable 
under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act for having submitted claims she knew were 
false. She therefore had to pay the maximum amount of penalties and assessments, which 
totaled $196,800.
