The Department of Justice 
The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) is the federal government’s executive 
department that is responsible for enforcing the law and administrating justice. The DOJ is 
headed by the United States Attorney General. United States Attorneys, which are under the 
direction of the Attorney General, serve as the nation’s litigators. They conduct most of the 
trial work in which the United States is a party, including the prosecution of fraud cases. 
They also indict individuals, negotiate settlements, and recover damages.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1921 
The DOJ and the federal government have increased their efforts to curb fraud and abuse in 
the federal spending. In 2006, for example, the Department of Justice (DOJ) formed the 
National Procurement Fraud Task Force to promote the early detection, prevention, and 
prosecution of procurement fraud. Since its creation, more than 300 procurement fraud 
cases have resulted in criminal convictions and the recovery of hundreds of millions of 
dollars in civil settlements and judgments. Also, President Obama recently clarified his 
position on procurement fraud by ordering an overhaul of the federal contracting system, 
vowing to “strengthen oversight to maximize transparency and accountability.” 
Furthermore, according to a report issued by the Office of the Attorney General (“National 
Priorities for the Investigation and Prosecution of White Collar Crime”), procurement fraud 
has been a primary area of investigative efforts by the DOJ since 1980. 
 
Such efforts are necessary because the federal government spends trillions of dollars each 
year on a wide variety of programs (e.g., national defense and homeland security, Social 
Security, Medicare and Medicaid, anti-poverty programs, interest on the national debt, 
education, veterans’ spending, unemployment  benefits, farm subsidies, etc.), and such 
expenditures create numerous opportunities for corrupt players to commit procurement 
fraud against the government. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), 
losses from fraud, misuse, and other types of improper payments are about $100 billion a 
year. 
 
Moreover, federal expenditures are increasing. During fiscal year (FY) 2009, the federal 
government spent about $3.52 trillion, up 18 percent from FY 2008, and the federal 
government is projected to spend $3.6 trillion in FY 2010. Thus, the threat of government 
fraud schemes is also increasing, and, as a result, there is a growing need to detect, prevent, 
and prosecute this type of fraud. 
 
The government’s message is clear: offenders will be prosecuted and punished to the full 
extent of the law.
