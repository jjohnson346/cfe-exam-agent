Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) 
The DCAA is essentially an audit agency that reviews procurement contracts. It has the 
authority to subpoena contractors’ records if fraud is suspected. Government suppliers with 
large contracts usually are assigned their own DCAA auditor. The Defense Contract Audit 
Manual explains fraud reporting procedures for DCAA auditors. Reports of fraud are passed 
to DCAA Counsel and the Assistant Director and, from there, to the appropriate DoD or 
federal investigative branch. DCAA auditors are trained to look for: 
• Poor internal controls 
• Bad financial situations 
• Inadequate accounting records 
• Poor timekeeping system 
• A mix of commercial, fixed-price, and cost-type contracts 
• A background of fraud 
• Management dominated by one or a few individuals 
• Individuals with lavish lifestyles beyond their incomes 
• No or few internal and external audits
