Other Federal Statutes 
The following federal laws are also commonly used in the prosecution of health care fraud 
cases. More detail on each of these statutes can be found in the “Law Related to Fraud” 
chapter in the Law section of the Fraud Examiners Manual. 
• Mail and Wire Fraud, Title 18, U.S.C., §§ 1341, 1343 : Mail and wire fraud makes it a crime 
to use the mails or wire communications to perpetrate a scheme to defraud a victim of 
money or property (e.g., present a false claim to Medicare, state health plan, or private 
insurer).  
• Conspiracy, Title 18, U.S.C., § 371, Title 18, U.S.C., § 286 : Section 286 makes it a crime for 
two or more people to agree or conspire to defraud the United States by obtaining, or 
aiding in obtaining, payment or allowance of any false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim. 
• Obstruction of Federal Audit, Title 18, U.S.C., § 1516 : This statute, originally passed in 1988, 
makes it a felony for anyone to influence, obstruct, or impede a federal auditor in the 
performance of his official duties. This statute is relevant to health care fraud because
