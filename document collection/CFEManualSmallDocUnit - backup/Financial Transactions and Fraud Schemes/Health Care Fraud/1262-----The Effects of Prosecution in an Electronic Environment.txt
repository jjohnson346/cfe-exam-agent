The Effects of Prosecution in an Electronic Environment 
EDI creates another type of legal evidence, but the basic legal principles regarding that 
evidence should remain intact. Therefore, the burden falls on the companies of the health 
care industry to demonstrate that its electronic system has proven safeguards that counteract 
fraud. If the system is proven to be reliable, the company can then show that it has created a 
reliable record of transactions. 
 
The greatest weakness within an EDI system is that in the prosecution, a defendant may 
claim that he did not enter the claim or that the claim was mishandled by the health care 
company. Thus, a health care company must maintain the integrity of its electronic records. 
The health care company must have in place several ways to uncover fraud, from automatic 
red flags to intricate fraud analysis programs that pick up on familiar patterns that may 
ultimately lead to fraud. 
 
A health care company must prove the origin of all electronic communication and the 
original content of the transaction. They must also reduce the possibility that the original 
claim’s content can be intentionally or unintentionally compromised. By doing these things, 
the health care industry can effectively use EDI without substantially raising the possibility 
of fraudulent activity.
