Red Flags of Rent-A-Patient Schemes 
• Large influx of out-of-state patients to a particular clinic; including clusters of patients 
from a particular location. 
• Several non-related procedures on a patient in a short period of time (e.g., a colonoscopy 
and circumcision on one patient within a few days or even weeks). 
• Numerous claims by a particular clinic for the following procedures: colonoscopies, 
endoscopies, septoplasties, circumcisions, and thoracoscopies with sympathectomy 
(a.k.a., “sweaty palms surgery”). 
• Parallel procedures on families (husbands, wives, and children) on the same day. 
• Extremely high staff salaries. 
• Charging beyond the average market price for procedures, medical equipment,  
and devices. 
• Frequent patients with out-of-network coverage.
