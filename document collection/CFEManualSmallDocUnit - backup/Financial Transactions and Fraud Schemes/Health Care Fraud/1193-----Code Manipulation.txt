Code Manipulation 
Code manipulation is a problem that is faced by all health insurers. Each service is identified 
using the American Medical Association’s uniformly accepted coding system, called the 
Physicians’ Current Procedural Terminology (CPT). Medicare and most private insurers have 
developed fee schedules that use CPT codes and their accompanying narrative descriptions 
as the basis for paying providers.  
 
However, because the coding system is complicated, providers and insurers often have 
difficulty identifying the codes that most accurately describe the services provided. The 
coding system is difficult to use because it attempts to identify codes for all accepted medical 
procedures, including codes to describe minor procedures that are components of more 
comprehensive procedures. Payment policies add to the difficulty. For example, the fee for 
surgery often includes the cost of related services for the global service period, that is, for a 
set number of days before and after the surgery. To prevent overpayment in these cases, 
insurers need to identify when claims for surgery include codes that represent related 
services and reduce the payment accordingly.

It is difficult for providers and insurers to maintain proficiency in proper coding practices 
because a substantial number of the codes are changed each year. These complexities can 
inadvertently lead providers to submit improperly coded claims. They also make insurers 
vulnerable to abuse from providers or billing services that attempt to maximize 
reimbursements by intentionally submitting claims containing inappropriate combinations  
of codes.
