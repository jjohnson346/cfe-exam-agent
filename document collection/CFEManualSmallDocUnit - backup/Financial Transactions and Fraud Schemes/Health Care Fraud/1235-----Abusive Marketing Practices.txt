Abusive Marketing Practices 
Many hospitals rely on marketing as a means of encouraging treatment and generating 
referrals. Overly aggressive marketing methods include: 
• Paying bonuses to employees to persuade or pressure prospective patients to undergo a 
psychiatric evaluation and to admit themselves for treatment. 
• Encouraging patients to admit themselves by offering financial incentives such as 
payment of plane fare, child care, COBRA payments, and waivers of patient co-
 payments or deductibles.
