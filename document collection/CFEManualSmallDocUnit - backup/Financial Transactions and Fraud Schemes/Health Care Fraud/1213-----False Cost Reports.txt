False Cost Reports 
Cost reports sometimes include noncovered items such as golf outings, parties, and exotic 
trips disguised as covered items. For example, an investigation disclosed that a hospital 
recovered silver from the processing of x-ray film, sold it, gave it to the candy stripers, only 
to have it “donated” back to the hospital. Since Medicare doesn’t consider donations as 
revenue, the hospital was able to claim higher expenses, thus more money from Medicare.
