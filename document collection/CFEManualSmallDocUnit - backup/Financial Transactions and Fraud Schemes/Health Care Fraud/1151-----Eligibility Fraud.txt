Eligibility Fraud 
A broker may seek to add ineligible family members, girlfriends, or associates to a group 
policy by representing them as employees.  
 
Another eligibility fraud is where a broker may sell a low-cost group policy to an 
organization that employs a small percentage of people with serious health problems. A 
better rate can be obtained by separating healthy people from sick people. The broker splits 
off the unhealthy people in their own group, placing the coverage with an insurer of last 
resort such as a carrier that is given favorable tax status in exchange for issuing coverage  
to anyone.
