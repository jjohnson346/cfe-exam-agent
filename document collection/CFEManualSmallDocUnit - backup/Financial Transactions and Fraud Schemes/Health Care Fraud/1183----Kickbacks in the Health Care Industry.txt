Kickbacks in the Health Care Industry 
Kickbacks in the health care industry can come from several sources. The medical 
community is facing competition that it has not faced in the past, and monetary offers to 
prospective patients have been difficult to refuse. For example, in one South Florida 
community, incentives such as free transportation to medical facilities, shopping centers, and 
refreshments are common. 
 
Examples of kickbacks are: 
• Payment for referral of patients 
• Waiver of deductible and co-payments 
• Payment for insurance contracts 
• Payment for vendor contracts
