State Level Enforcement 
In 1977, Congress devised the Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCU) program, to help 
states counter Medicaid fraud. MFCUs are state law enforcement agencies that investigate 
and prosecute cases involving Medicaid fraud, investigate and act on complaints of abuse or 
neglect of patients in facilities receiving Medica id funding, and refer cases, which will not be 
prosecuted, to the state Medicaid agency or other authority for administrative action. The 
only way a state can keep from establishing an MFCU is by certifying that there is no fraud 
in their state. 
 
Under MFCU program, each state is to implement its own MFCU. The federal government 
subsidizes each state’s program with 90 percent of the monies necessary to get that state’s 
MFCU up and rolling. Three years thereafter, the federal government provides the state’s 
MFCU with 75 percent of its operating costs. The only way a state can keep from 
establishing an MFCU is by certifying that there is no fraud in their state. 
 
Federal initiatives such as this have helped states effectively curb Medicaid fraud on state and 
local levels. According to the United States Government Accountability Office, for FY 2008, 
state MFCUs recovered more than $1.3 billion in  legal restitution, obtained more than 1,314 
convictions, and excluded 971 individuals from participating in the Medicaid and Medicare 
programs. 
 
To identify and detect Medicaid fraud at any level, fraud examiners must be apprised of 
various Medicaid fraud schemes because such schemes are, often, more stringently regulated 
at the state level.
