The Stark Law (Physician Self-Referrals) 
The Stark Law (also known as the physician self -referral law) attempts to limit the ability of 
physicians to profit from their referrals by prohibiting physicians from referring 
Medicare/Medicaid patients for designated health services (DHS) entities with which the 
Health Care Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1204                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
physician or his immediate family member has a financial relationship. The law was passed in 
two phases.   
 
Stark I was enacted as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989; it prohibited 
a physician from referring a patient to a clinical laboratory with which he (or an immediate 
family member) has a financial relationship. 
 
Stark II provided additional amendments and expanded the referral and billing prohibitions 
to additional “designated health services.” It strengthened Stark I’s prohibitions on physician 
referrals from certain designated health services (DHS) entities with which the physician or 
his immediate family member has a financial relationship. 
 
As related to Medicaid, Stark II prohibits a physician, in exchange for a payment of equity or 
reduction of debt, without an exception, to make: 
• A Medicaid referral;  
• A Medicaid claim; or  
• Compensation arrangement.  
 
In addition to these codified requirements, states often supplement the federal requirements 
with more stringent state requirements. For example, in Pennsylvania, physicians are 
prohibited from making any automatic referrals, whether they are enunciated in direct or 
indirect agreements with other health providers.  
 
Despite the general rule that physicians cannot profit from their referrals, there are several 
exceptions and safe harbor provisions to protect physicians from making certain referrals. In 
part, these exceptions include: referrals to and from physicians in the same group practice, 
same in-office ancillary services, prepaid plans, legitimate personal services arrangements, 
and physician recruitment. 
 
Although Stark II appears to mimic the Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute, the 
two laws are different. First, unlike the Anti-Kickback Act, which applies to all individuals, 
Stark II only applies to physicians and their family members. Second, where the Medicare 
and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute provides criminal penalties for its violations, Stark II is 
codified as a civil statute, and therefore only imposes monetary penalties, suspension, and 
termination. Finally, under Stark II, each Medi caid entity providing items or services for

payment must comply with reporting requirements and disclose information relating to the 
entity’s ownership, investment, and compensation arrangements. 
 
Violations of Stark II may subject a defendant to  $15,000 for each service improperly billed 
or claimed, $100,000 for participation in a circumvention arrangement or scheme, exclusion 
from participating as a provider in Medicaid programs, and/or a penalty of $10,000 each day 
reporting is delinquent.
