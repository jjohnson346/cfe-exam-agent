Failure of the Nursing Facility to Monitor Outside Providers 
Although nursing homes are required to perform numerous tasks to monitor patients and 
meet their needs, there are no requirements that nursing homes monitor the services or 
supplies provided to their patients. These providers are allowed to bill directly without 
adequate confirmation that the care or items were necessary or were delivered as claimed. 
 
Most nursing facilities do not have the in-house capability to provide all the services and 
supplies their patients need. Accordingly, outside providers market their services and 
supplies to nursing homes to meet the needs of their patients. Typically, provider 
representatives enter the home and offer to handle the entire transaction—from reviewing 
medical records to identify those patients who need their services, to billing—with no 
involvement by the nursing facility. Some homes allow providers or their representatives to 
review patient medical records contrary to federal regulations. By doing so, these providers 
can obtain all the information necessary to order, bill, and be reimbursed for services and 
supplies that are, in many instances, not necessary or even provided.
