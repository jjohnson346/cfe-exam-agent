PPOs 
PPO, or Preferred Provider Organization, is  a managed care arrangement in which the 
patient chooses a provider from a list of participating providers in the PPO network. Their 
care is not managed by one provider as in the HMO, and they may see any provider in the 
network. The patient is penalized for going outside the network, although not as severely as 
in an HMO network. Providers usually must bill the third-party payer and claims are 
assigned.
