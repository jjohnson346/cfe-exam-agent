CORPORATE GERRYMANDERING 
The risk pool assigned to an employer will accept any business no matter what the claim 
experience is. However, it does not have to accept any employer that owes premiums. Some 
employers will create a new corporate entity in order to obtain coverage or to avoid higher 
premiums due to past heavy losses. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Fireman’s Fund Insurance was awarded a $15 million judgment against a Hollywood 
entertainment company in a suit involving a workers’ compensation fraud scheme. The 
entertainment company set up a shell corporation to pose as a start-up production company 
needing insurance. The ruse allowed the company to get workers’ compensation at much 
lower rates than if Fireman’s Fund had known who they were actually insuring. The 
entertainment company then manipulated the coverage to other films in which it had an 
interest, again at significantly lower rates.
