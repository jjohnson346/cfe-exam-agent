Insurance Fraud


:


Cash, Loan, and Dividend Checks 
A company employee without the knowledge of an insured or contract holder requests cash, 
a loan, or a dividend check, and either deposits the check into his bank account or into a 
fictitious account. The employee, in order to minimize his chances of being detected 
committing a fraudulent act, might change the company policyholder’s address of record to 
either his address or a fictitious address. Once the check is issued, the address is then 
changed back to the previous address.
