Fraudulent Death Claims 
To obtain reimbursement for life insurance, a death certificate is required. However, phony 
death certificates are not that difficult to obtain. The person might be very much alive and 
missing or the person might be dead, and the death is past posted. With small settlements, 
death claims are not closely scrutinized and paid relatively easily.
