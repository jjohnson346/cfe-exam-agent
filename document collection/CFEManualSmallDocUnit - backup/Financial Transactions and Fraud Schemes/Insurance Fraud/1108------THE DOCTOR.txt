THE DOCTOR 
Doctors may be organizers or players in the scheme, but must be a part of it in order for it 
to work properly. Doctors are used to lend authenticity to the scheme, and they are well 
compensated for their efforts. The doctors bill for services that they may or may not render 
as well as for unnecessary services. In addition, if patients have regular health insurance, 
doctors may double bill for the services. If an injury is the result of an automobile accident 
that occurred while the patient was on the job, the doctor may bill all three insurance 
companies: the workers’ compensation carrier, the employee’s health insurance, and the 
automobile carrier. 
 
Because of coordination of benefit clauses in most insurance contracts, the insurance 
companies will coordinate the benefits to the extent that the maximum amount paid will be 
100 percent of the injuries. However, the doctors will not let the patient’s health insurance 
company know that the injury is work-related or accident-related and thus the claim may be 
overpaid, since both claims are paid at their full liability.  
 
Most of the treatment rendered will be office visits, x-rays, vascular studies, physical therapy, 
and spinal manipulations. In some cases hospital employees will be part of the scheme and 
allow the use of the facility fraudulently.
