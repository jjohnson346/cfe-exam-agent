Surety and Performance Bond Schemes 
Surety and performance bonds guarantee that certain events will or will not occur. An agent 
issues worthless bonds to the insured for high-risk coverage in hopes that a claim is never 
made. If a claim is made, the agent might pay it off from agency funds, delay the payment, or 
skip town.
