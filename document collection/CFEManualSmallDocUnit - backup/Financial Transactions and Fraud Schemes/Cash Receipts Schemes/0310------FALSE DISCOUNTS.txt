FALSE DISCOUNTS 
Those employees with the authority to grant discounts may utilize this authority to skim 
sales and receivables. In a false discount skimming scheme, an employee accepts full 
payment for an item, but records the transaction as if the customer had been given a 
discount. The employee skims the amount of the discount. For example, on a $100 
purchase, if an employee granted a false discount of 20 percent, he could skim $20 and leave 
the company’s books in balance.
