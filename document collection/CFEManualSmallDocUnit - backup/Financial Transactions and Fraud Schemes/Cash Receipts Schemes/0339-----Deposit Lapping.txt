Deposit Lapping   
One method that fraudsters sometimes use to conceal cash larceny from the deposit is 
lapping. Lapping occurs when an employee steals the deposit from day one, then replaces it 
with day two’s deposit. Day two is replaced with day three, and so on. The perpetrator is 
always one day behind, but as long as no one demands an up-to-the minute reconciliation of 
the deposits to the bank statement—and if daily receipts do not drop precipitously — he may 
be able to avoid detection for a period of time. Lapping is discussed in more detail in the 
Skimming section.
