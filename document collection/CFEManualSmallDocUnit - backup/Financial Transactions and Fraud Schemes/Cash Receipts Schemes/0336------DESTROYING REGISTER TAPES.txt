DESTROYING REGISTER TAPES   
If the fraudster cannot make the cash and the tape balance, the next best thing is to prevent 
others from computing the totals and discovering the imbalance. Employees who are 
stealing from the register sometimes destroy detail tapes that would implicate them in a 
crime. When detail tapes are missing or defaced, it may be because someone is trying to 
conceal a fraud.
