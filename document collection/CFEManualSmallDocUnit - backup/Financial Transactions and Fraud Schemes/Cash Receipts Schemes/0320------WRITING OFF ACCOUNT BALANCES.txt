WRITING OFF ACCOUNT BALANCES 
Some employees cover their skimming by posting entries to contra revenue accounts such as 
“discounts and allowances.” If, for instance, an employee intercepts a $1,000 payment, he 
would create a $1,000 “discount” on the acco unt to compensate for the missing money. 
Another account that might be used in this type of concealment is the bad debts expense 
account.  
 
EXAMPLE 
A billing manager was author ized to write off certain patient balances as hardship 
allowances. This employee accepted payments from  patients, then instructed billing personnel 
to write off the balance in question. The payments were never posted; they were intercepted 
by the billing manager. She covered approximately $30,000 in stolen funds by using her 
authority to write off patients’ balances.
