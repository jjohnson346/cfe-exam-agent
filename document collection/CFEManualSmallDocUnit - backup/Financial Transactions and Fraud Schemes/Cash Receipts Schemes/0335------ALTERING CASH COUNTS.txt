ALTERING CASH COUNTS 
Another method for concealing cash larceny is to alter the cash counts on registers. When 
cash from a register is totaled and prepared for deposit, an employee simply records the 
wrong amount so that the cash on hand appears to balance with the total on the register 
tape. Obviously, employees who deal with the receipt of cash should not be charged with 
verifying the amount of cash on hand in their own register, but this control is often 
overlooked.
