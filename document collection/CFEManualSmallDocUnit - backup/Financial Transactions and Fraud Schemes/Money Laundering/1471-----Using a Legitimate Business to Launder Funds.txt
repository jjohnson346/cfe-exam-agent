Using a Legitimate Business to Launder Funds 
One of the most comm on methods of laundering funds is to filter the money through a 
legitimate business, otherwise known as a “front” business. A front business can be a very 
effective way to launder money because it provides a safe place for organizing and managing 
criminal activity, where the comings and goings of large numbers of people will not arouse 
undue suspicion. In addition, a front that does legitimate business provides cover for 
delivery and transportation related to illegal activity. The expenses from illegal activity can be 
attributed to the legitimate enterprise, and illegal revenues can be easily placed into the 
enterprise. 
 
The three methods most commonly used to hide assets or launder money through a front 
business are: overstatement of reported revenues, overstatement of reported expenses, and 
balance sheet laundering.
