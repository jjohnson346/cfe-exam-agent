The Real Estate Industry 
Money launderers often use the real estate industry to launder illicitly obtained money. 
Generally, the real estate industry is attractive to money launderers for various reasons. For 
example, the vast array of financial transactions linked to real estate provides money 
launderers an exceptional range of options for abusing these procedures to launder and use 
illegally obtained funds. In addition, real estate transactions often involve multiple parties 
(such as brokers, agents, and appraisers), which can obscure the source of investment funds 
and the identity of the true owner. Finally, money launderers may earn additional profits 
from introducing illicit funds into the real estate industry, especially in vibrant real  
estate markets.   
 
Although there is a vast number of methods to launder money in the real estate industry, 
there are a few common schemes that warrant identification and discussion, including: 
• Loan-back schemes 
• Back-to-back loan schemes 
• Shell companies 
• Appraisal fraud
