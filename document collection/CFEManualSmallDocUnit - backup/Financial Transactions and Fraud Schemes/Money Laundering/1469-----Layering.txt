Layering 
If the placement of the initial funds goes undetected, financial transactions can be designed 
in complex patterns in order to prevent detection. This stage of the process is referred to as 
layering  and represents the most difficult area of detection. Once the funds have been 
deposited into a financial institution, a launderer can move the funds around by using layers 
of financial transactions designed to confuse the audit trail. The money can even be 
transported out of the country through wire transfers.
