Title II — Reporting and Recordkeeping 
Title II of the Bank Secrecy Act is codified as 31, U.S.C., §§ 5311–5330. The purpose of 
these sections is to require certain reports or records to be filed or kept by “financial 
institutions.” Section 5312(a)(2) defines “financial institution” very broadly to include not 
only banks, but also securities brokers; currency exchange houses; insurance companies; loan 
companies; travel agencies; telegraph companies; issuers or cashiers of checks or money 
orders; auto, boat, and airplane dealers; casinos; and persons involved in real estate closings 
and settlements. Only recently has the Treasury Department begun to reign in much of the 
non-financial institution transaction business in the U.S. by requiring registration of these 
diverse enterprises (see the “Money Services Business” excerpt below). 
 
The regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department are contained primarily in 
Chapter 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations at Part 103, Subpart B and require the 
following reports: 
 
CURRENCY TRANSACTION REPORT (CTR) — FINCEN FORM 104 
All banks, and certain other financial institutions, are required to fill out currency transaction 
reports (CTR) whenever there is a currency transaction (deposit, withdrawal, exchange, or 
cashing of checks) of $10,000 or more.  The easiest way to summarize the filing requirement is 
to remember: if currency in excess of $10,000 is brought into a financial institution to conduct 
a transaction, or if as the result of a transaction, $10,000 in currency leaves the financial 
institution, a CTR must be filed.  
 
FinCEN Form 104 (formerly named IRS Form 4789) is prepared by the financial institution 
and contains the name(s) of the individual(s) conducting the transaction(s) or the name(s) of 
the person(s) or organization(s) on whose behalf the transaction is being conducted, as well as 
all identifying data of these individuals or entities. It also requires the details of the transaction 
and identifying data of the financial institution preparing the form. For purposes of reporting, 
multiple transactions must be treated as a single transaction if the financial institution has 
knowledge that the transactions are by or on behalf of the same person and the amounts total 
more than $10,000 during any one business day. 
 
Under Title 31, U.S.C., section 5313, the Treasury Department publishes a “mandatory 
exemption” list that specifically identifies entities whose transactions with a financial 
institution are exempt from these reporting requirements. The exempted entities include 
banks, departments or agencies of state or federal government, and other businesses “whose 
Money Laundering  Financial Transactions   
1.1624                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
reports have little or no value for law enforcement purposes.” The exempt list must be 
published periodically in the Federal Register.  
 
The Treasury Department can also provide “discretionary exemptions” for “qualified business 
customers,” which are defined as businesses that  (1) maintain transaction accounts (as defined 
by the Federal Reserve Act) at the particular institution; (2) frequently engage in transactions 
with the institution that are subject to the reporting requirements; and (3) meet the guidelines 
and criteria established by the Treasury Department to ensure that the failure to file reports on 
these entities will not interfere with the purposes of the Act. 
 
A copy of Form 104 is included at the end of this chapter. 
 
CURRENCY REPORTS BY CASINOS — FINCEN FORM 102 
Form 102 (formerly named IRS Form 8362) is required to be filed by casinos licensed by 
state or local government and having an annual gross revenue in excess of $1,000,000. 
Nevada casinos are exempt from filing these forms because of a strict state law that requires 
reporting for currency transactions. The filing requirements and transaction details for this 
form are almost identical to Form 104. 
 
CURRENCY REPORTS BY NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESSES — IRS FORM 8300 
The PATRIOT Act created Title 31, section 5331, of the U.S. Code, which requires persons 
engaged in any trade or business to file a report with FinCEN when, in the course of their 
business, they receive more than $10,000 in coins or currency, either in one transaction or in 
two or more related transactions. For purposes of computing the amount of multiple related 
transactions, the recipient must aggregate all payments made within one year of the first 
payment. Transactions covered by this Section must be reported within 15 days of receipt of 
payments in excess of $10,000. The rules govern ing these reports are codified at 31, CFR, § 
103.30. 
 
This section does not apply to financial institutions, which are already covered by 31, U.S.C., 
§ 5313 as described above. It also does not apply to transactions occurring entirely outside 
the United States. In addition, the rules exempt certain loans, installment sales, and down 
payment plans.  
 
The information required to be reported under section 5331 is very similar to the 
information that was already required by the IRS under section 6050I of the Internal 
Financial Transactions  Money Laundering 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1625 
Revenue Code. Because of the similarity between the two statutes, the reports are to be 
made on the same Form 8300, which is filed jointly with FinCEN and the IRS. Essentially, 
the rule imposes no new record-keeping burden (since Form 8300 already had to be filed 
with the IRS). 
 
Under the Internal Revenue Code, there are both civil and criminal penalties for failure to 
file Form 8300 or filing a false form. Criminal sanctions include imprisonment of up to five 
years (for a willful failure to file) and fines of up to $500,000 (for organizations knowingly 
filing a false return). 
 
REPORTS OF INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORTATION OF CURRENCY OR MONETARY INSTRUMENT CUSTOMS (CMIR) — FINCEN FORM 105 
Pursuant to Title 31, U.S.C., § 5316, a person shall file a report if he transports or is about to 
transport monetary instruments of more than $10,000 into or out of the United States at one 
time or if he receives by transport, mail, or shipment monetary instruments in excess of 
$10,000 at one time transported into the United Sates from a place outside the United States. 
FinCEN Form 105 (formerly named Customs Form 4790) is to be filed at the time of 
transportation or within 15 days of receipt. 
 
For the purposes of this statute, the term “monetary instrument” means United States and 
foreign coin and currency; bearer instruments such as business, bank, or personal checks; 
money orders; promissory notes; bearer stocks; and bonds. 
 
There are exemptions from the CMIR filin g requirements that extend to banks for  
transfers of funds through normal banking procedures, the Federal Reserve, and certain 
common carriers. 
 
A copy of this form is included at the end of this chapter. 
 
REPORT OF FOREIGN BANK AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS (FBAR)—TREASURY FORM 90-22.1 
Treasury Department regulations require citizens of the United States and resident aliens to 
file a report when they maintain a financial interest or signature authority over a foreign bank 
account with a balance of more than $10,000 during the calendar year. Accounts in different 
foreign countries have to be aggregated.
