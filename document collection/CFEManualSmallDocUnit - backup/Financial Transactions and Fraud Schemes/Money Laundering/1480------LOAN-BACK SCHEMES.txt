LOAN-BACK SCHEMES 
Money launderers often use loan-back schemes to finance the purchase of properties directly 
or indirectly through purchasing shares in property investment funds. In a typical loan-back 
scheme, money launderers will deposit illicit funds in an overseas entity that they own and 
then the entity loans the funds back to the launderers. The purpose of the loan is to make 
the money source appear legitimate and to conceal the parties’ identities or the nature of the 
financial transactions associated with the loans.
