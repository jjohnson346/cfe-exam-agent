State Laws 
Approximately 30 states have enacted statutes that criminalize money laundering, most of 
which apply to businesspeople and professionals. Some of the state statutes are broader than

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1639 
the federal statutes, and they are often enforced more aggressively than their federal 
counterparts.  
 
Many states have criminalized attempted  money laundering with the same penalties as the 
completed crime. Some states contain a “sting provision,” which enables the prosecution of 
activity even though the laundered money is not actually derived from criminal activity, but 
rather supplied by government agents as part of a sting operation. Several states have also 
enacted legislation requiring financial institutions and businesses to file currency transaction 
reports that mirror the federal reports. Some require duplicate filing with the states; others 
are satisfied with the federal filing.
