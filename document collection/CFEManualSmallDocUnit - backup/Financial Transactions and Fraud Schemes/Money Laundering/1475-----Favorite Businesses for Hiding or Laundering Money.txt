Favorite Businesses for Hiding or Laundering Money 
In general terms, the businesses chosen for money laundering possess one or more of the 
following characteristics:  
• Revenue — A revenue base that is difficult to measure because most revenue comes from 
cash transactions with a highly variable amount per customer. This allows extra money 
to be brought into the business and disguised as revenue. 
• Expense — Expenses that are variable and difficult to measure can enable the launderer 
to extract money from the front business without giving rise to undue suspicion.  
• History — Historical ties either with the ethnic base of a particular criminal group or with 
industries that have traditionally served as a base for criminal activity.
