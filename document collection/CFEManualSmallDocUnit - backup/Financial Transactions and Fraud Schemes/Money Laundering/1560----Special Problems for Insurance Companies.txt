Special Problems for Insurance Companies 
Although financial institutions such as banks are primarily associated with money laundering 
activities, insurance companies have become major targets of money laundering operations 
because of the variety of services and investment vehicles they offer that can be used to 
conceal the source of funds. 
 
The most common form of money laundering that insurance companies face involves single 
premium contracts or policies. Examples include purchases of annuities, lump sum top-ups 
to an existing life insurance contract, and lump sum contributions to personal pension 
contracts.

Insurance companies, like other financial institutions, should educate their employees to look 
out for transactions that appear to be inconsistent with a customer’s known legitimate 
business or personal activities or the normal transactions for that type of account. To that 
end, insurance companies should institute “Know Your Customer” programs such as those 
described above.
