Sharing Information Between Financial Institutions 
Pursuant to section 314(b) of the PATRIOT Act, the Treasury Department issued a rule 
allowing financial institutions to share customer information with one another. The term 
“financial institution” includes any entity that is required to have an anti-money laundering 
program under the Bank Secrecy Act (see above). In order to share information with another 
financial institution, the sharing institution must follow these steps: 
• File a prescribed notice form with FinCEN stating that it intends to share customer 
information with other financial institutions (the notice remains effective for one year); 
• The institution may then share the information with another institution provided that it 
has verified that the other institution has also filed a notice with FinCEN (FinCEN will 
periodically release a list of institutions who have submitted notices; if an institution is 
on the list, then the sharing institution will be considered to have fulfilled its 
“verification” duty); 
• The institution must ensure that the shared information is secure and not used for any 
purpose other than to identify and, where appropriate, report on money laundering or 
terrorist activities; determine whether to establish or maintain an account or conduct a 
transaction; or assist the other sharing institution with its compliance of BSA regulations;  
• The institution must also file a Suspicious Activity Report if, based on the shared 
information, the institution suspects that the individual or entity may be involved in 
money laundering or terrorist activity. 
 
Section 355 of the Act also permits insured depository institutions to share information in 
written employment references about known or suspected  unlawful activity of their current or 
former directors, officers, employees, agents, or other persons affiliated with the institution. 
This provision, which is codified at 12, U.S.C., § 1828(w) does not make it mandatory for 
banks to disclose this information, but it does protect them from liability if they voluntarily 
make such disclosures, as long as the disclosures are not made with malicious intent.
