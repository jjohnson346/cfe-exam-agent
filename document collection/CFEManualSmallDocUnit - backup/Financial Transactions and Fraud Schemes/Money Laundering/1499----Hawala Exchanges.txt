Hawala Exchanges 
Although the theoretical workings of hawala have been around for at least a century, only 
recently has the United States publicly recognized it as a threat to homeland security. 
Hawala, often referred to as hundi, is an informal remittance system primarily exploited in 
Asia and the Middle East. Because the system is unregulated and leaves virtually no paper 
trail, it is ripe for money laundering.
