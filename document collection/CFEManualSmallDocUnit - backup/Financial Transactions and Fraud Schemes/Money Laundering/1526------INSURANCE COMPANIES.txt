INSURANCE COMPANIES 
Although insurance companies have always fallen under the definition of a “financial 
institution” under the BSA, the Treasury Department had never issued any rules pertaining 
to the industry. The PATRIOT Act, however, requires that all “financial institutions” 
establish anti-money laundering programs, and it gives the Secretary of the Treasury the 
discretion to determine which institutions would be required to file SARs. 
 
In November 2005, FinCEN published rules pertaining to insurance companies that sell 
certain types of insurance products. The rules apply only to companies that sell “covered 
products” that FinCEN deemed to be more at risk for money laundering activities than 
other types of insurance products. Companies that sell these covered products are required 
to file SARs and to implement anti-money laundering programs. The rules define “covered 
products” as any of the following: 
• A permanent life insurance policy (other than a group policy); 
• An annuity contract (other than a group annuity contract); or 
• Any other insurance product with cash value or investment features. 
 
Group insurance products, term life, property, casualty, health, and title insurance policies 
are not considered “covered products.”

Also, insurance companies must report suspicious activities to FinCEN. FinCEN Form 
108—Suspicious Activity Report by Insurance Companies—has been proposed; however, 
until the Form is approved, insurance companies should use the Suspicious Activity 
Reporting Form used by the securities and futures industries (FinCEN Form 101) to report 
suspicious activities.
