Depositing Cash and Writing Checks in Excess of Reported Revenues and Expenses (Balance Sheet Laundering) 
Rather than attempting to disguise money as normal business revenue, excess funds can 
simply be deposited into the bank account of the business. This technique is known as 
Financial Transactions  Money Laundering 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1605 
balance sheet laundering because it is independent of the money that flows in and out of  
the business. 
 
EXAMPLE 
ABC Used Cars deposits an additional $30,000 per month in its account although 
there are no recorded sales for this amount. At the end of the year, the company has an 
extra $360,000 in cash in its account. 
 
This type of scheme can be detected by examining the revenue records of the business. 
Every legitimate asset in a company’s possession had to have come from somewhere — if not 
from revenues then from a limited number of other credible alternatives. The basic 
alternative sources are loans, sale of property or equipment, and capital investments from 
shareholders. All of these transactions require significant documentary evidence, which the 
examiner should seek out to explain any suspicious infusion of cash into a suspect business.
