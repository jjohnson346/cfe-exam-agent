MUTUAL FUNDS 
As part of the PATRIOT Act, mutual funds are also required to establish anti-money 
laundering programs. In May 2003, the Department of Treasury and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a regulation requiring mutual funds to implement 
“reasonable measures” to establish customer identification procedures and to verify whether 
customers appear on lists of any known or suspected terrorists.  
 
In May 2006, the Treasury Department issued fi nal approval to regulations that require 
mutual funds to report suspicious activities to FinCEN. Under these regulations, mutual 
funds are required to report suspicious currency and non-currency transactions (or 
attempted transactions) of $5,000 or more. The report would be filed on the “SAR-SF” 
(Suspicious Activity for Securities and Futures Industries) Form 101.

The Rule states that four categories of transactions will require reporting. These are the same 
four categories that trigger reporting requirements for money service businesses and 
currency exchanges: 
• Transactions involving funds derived from criminal activity, or intended or conducted to 
hide or disguise funds from criminal activity; 
• Transactions designed to evade Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requirements; 
• Transactions appearing to serve no business or apparent lawful purpose; or 
• Transactions involving the use of the mutual fund to facilitate criminal activity.
