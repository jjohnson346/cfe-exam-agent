CASINOS AND CARD CLUBS 
Effective March 25, 2003, casinos and card clubs with gross revenue over $1,000,000 must 
file suspicious activity reports on form SAR-C. Under the rule, casinos and card clubs must 
report suspicious activity if a transaction involves or aggregates at least $5,000 in funds and if 
it meets one of the four categories that generally trigger SARs. (See previous sections on 
Financial Institutions, Money Service Businesses, Mutual Funds, etc.) 
 
Some possible examples of suspicious activity, according to FinCEN, include: 
• Using wire transfers and cashier’s checks to deposit funds into casino accounts and using 
the money for little or no gaming activity before cashing out; and 
• Transferring chips to other individuals to cash out, or redeeming chips for casino checks 
that total “significantly more” than the amount deposited with “no apparent winnings to 
account for the excess amount.” 
 
Casinos are also required to file Currency Transaction Reports via FinCEN Form 102 or the 
Nevada state form (see above).
