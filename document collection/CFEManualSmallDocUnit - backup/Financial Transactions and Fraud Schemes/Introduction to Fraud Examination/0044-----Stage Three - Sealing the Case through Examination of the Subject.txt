Stage Three: Sealing the Case through Examination of the Subject 
Circumstantial evidence might be explained away, and direct testimony impeached or 
rebutted. The best witness against the suspect might be himself. The suspect’s admissions 
might provide otherwise missing elements. “False exculpatories” — lies offered to explain or 
justify conduct — might be the best evidence of intent. False denials of cash deposits in a 
corruption case might indicate an illicit source; false explanations for fraudulent 
representations might help prove that the original misstatements were intentional. 
 
To be effective, impeachment must show real, not apparent or explainable contradictions, 
and must focus on central, not tangential or trivial points. Attempted impeachment fails 
many times because the plaintiff  has not laid a sufficient foundation to show that the 
defendant’s statements were knowingly false. 
 
To adequately prepare the fraud examiner to understand and respond to the complex nature 
of fraud, the remaining material is divided into four sections: Financial Transactions and 
Fraud Schemes, Law, Investigation, and Fraud Prevention and Deterrence.
