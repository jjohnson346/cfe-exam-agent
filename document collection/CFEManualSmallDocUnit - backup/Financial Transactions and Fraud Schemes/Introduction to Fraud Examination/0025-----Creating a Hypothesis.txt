Creating a Hypothesis 
The hypothesis is invariably a “worst-case” scenario. That is, based on the allegation, what is 
the worst possible outcome? In this case, for Bailey Books, it would be that one of its 
purchasing agents was accepting kickbacks to steer business to a particular vendor. A 
hypothesis can be created for any specific allegation, i.e., a bribery or kickback scheme, 
embezzlement, conflict of interest, financial statement fraud, etc. In furtherance of the 
hypotheses, fraud examiners know that each specific scheme has its own unique 
characteristics that constitute the badges or “red flags” of fraud. 
 
Testing the Hypothesis 
Testing a hypothesis involves creating a “what-if” scenario. If, as part of the hypothesis, a 
bribery of a purchasing agent existed, the fraud examiner likely would find some or all of the 
following facts: 
• A personal relationship between the buyer and vendor 
• Ability of the purchasing agent to steer business toward a favored vendor 
• Higher prices and/or lower quality for the product or service being purchased 
• Excessive spending by the purchasing agent 
 
In the hypothetical case of Linda Reed Collins, the Certified Fraud Examiner—using Bailey 
Books’ own records—can readily establish whether or not one vendor is receiving a larger 
proportional share of the business than similar vendors. Bridges could ascertain whether or 
not Bailey Books was paying too much for a particular product, such as paper, by simply 
calling other vendors and determining competitive pricing. A personal relationship with any 
suspected vendor and the buyer could be confirmed by discreet observation or inquiry. 
Whether or not a particular purchasing agent had the ability to steer business toward a 
favored vendor could be determined by reviewing the company’s internal controls to 
ascertain who is involved in the decision-making process. The purchasing agent’s lifestyle 
could be discreetly determined through examination of public documents such as real estate 
records and vehicle titles.
