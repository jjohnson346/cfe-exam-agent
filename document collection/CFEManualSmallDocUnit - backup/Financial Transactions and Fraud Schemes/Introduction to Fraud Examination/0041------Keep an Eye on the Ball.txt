Introduction to Fraud Examination


:


Keep an Eye on the Ball 
Examiners must remember the importance of the fraud theory and keep in mind exactly 
what they are attempting to prove at all times. If examiners lose track of the objective, they 
should review and reorganize the evidence, develop an alternate theory, and refocus efforts. 
The examiner always is trying to prove or disprove something — even if merely a hunch — 
but never merely collecting information.
