The Fraud Examiner’s Tool Kit 
Essentially three tools are available to the fraud examiner regardless of the nature of the 
fraud examination. First is interviewing, which is the process of obtaining relevant information 
about the matter from those with knowledge of it. For example, in developing 
information about Linda Reed Collins, it might be necessary to interview her co-workers, 
superiors, and subordinates. 
 
Second, the fraud examiner must be skilled in the examination of financial statements, books 
and records, and supporting documents. The examiner must know the legal ramifications of 
evidence and how to maintain the chain of custody over documents. For example, checks 
and other financial records to prove the case must be lawfully obtained, analyzed, and 
conclusions must be drawn, if it is determined that Linda Reed Collins was taking payoffs 
from a supplier. 
 
Finally, fraud examiners are often placed in a position where they must observe behavior, 
search for displays of wealth, and in some instances, observe specific offenses. A Certified 
Fraud Examiner, for example, might recommend a video surveillance of a company’s 
cashiers department to witness a defalcation being committed. Or, the fraud examiner might 
establish a visual surveillance in a public place to determine the patterns or activities of the 
subject.
