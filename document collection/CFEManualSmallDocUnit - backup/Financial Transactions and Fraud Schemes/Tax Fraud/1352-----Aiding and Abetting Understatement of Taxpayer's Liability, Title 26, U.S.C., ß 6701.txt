Aiding and Abetting Understatement of Taxpayer's Liability, Title 26, U.S.C., § 6701 
The Code imposes a civil penalty on any person who aids or assists, or procures or advises, 
in the preparation or presentation of any tax-related document if the person knows or has 
reason to believe that the document will be used in connection with a material tax matter 
and will result in the understatement of a taxpayer’s liability. The penalty may also be 
imposed if the person acts through an employee or agent by ordering or causing his 
subordinate to act or by failing to prevent his subordinate from acting.  
 
The amount of the penalty is $1,000 for each un derstating taxpayer ($10,000 in the case of a 
corporate client return) per period.
