Claim of Right Doctrine 
In the United States, a taxpayer must recognize income if he receives the income, even if he 
does not have a fixed right to the income. Thus, a taxpayer may seek to evade paying their 
income tax by claiming that he does not have an unrestricted right to the money at issue.
