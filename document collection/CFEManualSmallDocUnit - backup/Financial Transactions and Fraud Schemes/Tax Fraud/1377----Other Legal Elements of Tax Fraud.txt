Other Legal Elements of Tax Fraud 
Embezzled Money is immediately income to the embezzler even though he is under a duty 
to repay it, but upon repayment, the embezzler gets a deduction for the repayment. For 
example, in Stephens v. Commissioner, 905 F2d 667 (7th Cir. 1990), a taxpayer embezzled about 
$530,000 from his employer (Raytheon) and recorded it on his tax return as “consulting 
income.” The taxpayer was ordered to pay restitution to Raytheon plus interest. He was 
allowed deductions under IRS Code section 165 (c)(2), relating to ordinary and necessary 
business expense for the restitution amount in the year paid. But the court did not allow a 
deduction for the interest.
