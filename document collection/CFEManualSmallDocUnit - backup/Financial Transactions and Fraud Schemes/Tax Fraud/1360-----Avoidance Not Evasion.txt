Tax Fraud


:


Avoidance Not Evasion 
In contrast to tax fraud, which refers to illegal methods of tax reduction, tax avoidance refers 
to a legal means of lowering one’s tax bill through legitimate deductions, credits, and 
shelters. Thus, establishing that the taxpayer was engaging in tax avoidance and not evasion 
provides a defense to tax fraud.
