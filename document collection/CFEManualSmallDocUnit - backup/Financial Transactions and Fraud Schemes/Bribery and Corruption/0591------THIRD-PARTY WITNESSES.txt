THIRD-PARTY WITNESSES 
Potential third-party sources include business colleagues, personal associates, bankers, 
brokers, real estate agents, accountants and tax preparers, ex-spouses, and romantic interests 
(particularly former romantic interests). Subjects often boast to their close associates of their 
new wealth, or entertain them with the fruits thereof. Casual remarks by a subject to a 
colleague (and repeated to an examiner) have undone the suspect, even when intensive 
audits have failed. Follow the Financial/Behavioral Profile format to the extent feasible. Of 
course, no single third-party witness is likely to possess all this information, but a complete 
picture can be assembled from bits and pieces provided by a number of such sources. 
 
TRACING ILLICIT TRANSACTIONS 
Other techniques for tracing illicit payments can be found in the “Tracing Illicit 
Transactions” chapter in the Investigation section of the Fraud Examiners Manual.
