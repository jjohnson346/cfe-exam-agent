Bribery and Corruption

The Corrupt Payer 
Like the recipients of bribery payments, the payer will also demonstrate certain identifiable 
characteristics: 
• The Gift Bearer — The businessperson who routinely offers inappropriate gifts, provides 
lavish business entertainment, or otherwise tries to ingratiate himself is often the one 
offering still more valuable inducements. 
• The Sleaze Factor — The corrupt payer is frequently a person known or suspected in the 
industry to be involved in payoffs or other fraudulent activities. 
• The Too-Successful Bidder — A supplier who is consistently awarded work, without any 
apparent competitive advantage, might be providing under-the-table incentives. 
• Poor Quality, Higher Prices — Particularly after the corrupt relationship has been sealed, the 
quality of product and service provided by the payer might deteriorate and prices 
increase. 
• The One-Person Operation — In certain industries, small, closely held companies that do not 
have the reporting and internal control requirements of their larger, publicly held 
competitors resort to payoffs as a means of marketing advantage. Be alert for 
independent sales representatives, consultants, or other middlemen, because they are 
favored conduits for funneling and concealing illegal payments.
