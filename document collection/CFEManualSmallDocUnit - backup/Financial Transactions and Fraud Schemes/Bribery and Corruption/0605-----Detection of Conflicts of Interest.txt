Detection of Conflicts of Interest 
Conflicts of interest are probably one of the most difficult schemes to uncover. Therefore, 
no fast and easy detection methods exist for this type of fraud. Some of the more common 
methods that can be used are tips and complaints, comparisons of vendor addresses with 
employee addresses, review of vendor ownership files, review of exit interviews, 
comparisons of vendor addresses to addresses of subsequent employers, policies requiring 
certain employees to provide the names and employers of immediate family members, and 
interviews with purchasing personnel for favorable treatment of one or more vendors.
