The Business Profile — Analysis 
The business profile  begins the examination process. It identifies prospective witnesses and 
targets, as well as relevant documents and transactions, and should provide leads as to 
whether an on-book or off-book scheme is being used. 
 
Information of the suspect business should be obtained about the organization, personnel, 
money flow pattern (source of available funds, related expenditures, etc.), location of bank 
accounts, financial condition, and recordkeeping system. This information can be obtained 
through interviews of employees, customers, and competitors; business bank account and 
loan records; financial statements; tax returns; business reporting companies; and business 
public filings.
