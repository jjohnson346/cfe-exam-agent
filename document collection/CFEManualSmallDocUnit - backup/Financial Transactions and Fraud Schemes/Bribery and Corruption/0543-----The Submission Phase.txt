The Submission Phase 
In the actual submission phase of the process, where bids are proffered to the buyer, several 
schemes may be used to win a contract for a particular supplier. The principal offense tends 
to be abuse of the sealed bid process. Competitive bids are confidential; they are, of course, 
supposed to remain sealed until a specified date at which all bids are opened and reviewed by 
the purchasing company. The person or persons who have access to sealed bids are often 
the targets of unethical vendors seeking an advantage in the process.

EXAMPLE 
Gifts and cash payments were given to a majority owner of a company in exchange for 
preferential treatment during the bidding process. The supplier who paid the bribes was 
allowed to submit his bids last, knowing what prices his competitors had quoted, or in the 
alternative, he was allowed to actually see his competitors’ bids and adjust his own 
accordingly.  
 
Vendors also bribe employees of the purchaser for confidential information that will help 
them prepare their bid. Other reasons to bribe employees of the purchaser include ensuring 
receipt of a late bid or falsify the bid log, to extend the bid opening date, and to control bid 
openings.
