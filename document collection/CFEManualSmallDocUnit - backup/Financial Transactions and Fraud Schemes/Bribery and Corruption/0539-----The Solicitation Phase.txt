The Solicitation Phase 
In the solicitation phase of the competitive bidding process, fraudsters attempt to influence 
the selection of a contractor by restricting the pool of competitors from whom bids are 
sought. In other words, a corrupt vendor pays an employee of the purchasing company to 
ensure that one or more of the vendor’s competitors do not get to bid on the contract. In 
this manner, the corrupt vendor is able to improve his chances of winning the job.  
 
One type of scheme involves the sales representative who deals on behalf of a number of 
potential bidders. The sales representative bribes a contracting official to rig the solicitation, 
ensuring that only those companies represented by him get to submit bids. It is not 
uncommon in some sectors for buyers to “require” bidders to be represented by certain sales 
or manufacturing representatives. These representatives pay a kickback to the buyer to 
protect their clients’ interests. The result of this transaction is that the purchasing company is 
deprived of the ability to get the best price on its contract. Typically, the group of 
“protected” vendors will not actually compete against each other for the purchaser’s 
contracts, but instead engage in “bid pooling.”
