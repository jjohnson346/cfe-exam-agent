Bribery and Corruption

Other Kickback Schemes 
Bribes are not always paid to employees to process phony invoices. Some outsiders seek 
other fraudulent assistance from employees of the victim organization. For instance, 
inspectors are sometimes paid off to accept substandard materials, or to accept short 
shipments of goods.  
 
Representatives of companies wishing to purchase goods or services from the victim 
organization at unauthorized discounts sometimes bribe employees with billing authority. 
The corrupt employees make sales to their accomplices at greatly reduced rates?sometimes 
even selling items at a loss?and in return they receive a portion of the discount.
