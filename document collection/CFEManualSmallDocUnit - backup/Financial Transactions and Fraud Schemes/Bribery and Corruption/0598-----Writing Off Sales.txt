Writing Off Sales 
The other type of sales scheme involves tampering with the books of the victim company to 
decrease or write off the amount owed by the company in which the employee has a hidden 
interest. For instance, after an employee’s company purchases goods or services from the 
victim organization, credit memos may be issued against the sale, causing it to be written off 
to contra accounts such as Discounts and Allowances. A large number of reversing entries to 
sales may be a sign that fraud is occurring in an organization.  
 
EXAMPLE  
A plant manager assisted favored clients by delaying billing on their purchases for up to 60 
days. When the receivable on these clients’ accounts became delinquent, the perpetrator 
issued credit memos against the sales to delete them. The plant manager issued new invoices 
on the sales after the “old” receivables were taken off the books. In this way, the receivables 
could be carried indefinitely on the books without ever becoming past due.
