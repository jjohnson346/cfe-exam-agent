Targeted Information 
Recruits are typically instructed to provide a specific piece or category of information, rather 
than being allowed to indiscriminately retrieve whatever secret information they happen to 
come in contact with. The reason is that most recruits lack the technical expertise to identify 
truly important intelligence data. Furthermore, most recruits are not sophisticated 
intelligence-gatherers, so the more information they attempt to retrieve, the more likely it is 
that they will be detected. Therefore, the control (the spy who recruited the mole and directs 
her activities) typically assigns the recruit a narrowly defined information goal. If the mole 
successfully completes this task, her objective might be expanded to include other items.
