The Power Broker 
In another common scheme, the attacker contacts the help desk and claims to be a high-
 ranking company official, an influential client, or some other imposing figure. Background 
searches of securities filings, government filings, company websites, or annual reports are 
used to choose the fake identity the spy will use. The spy uses his false credentials to bully 
the help desk into handing out passwords, remote-access software, or even some key piece 
of business information.
