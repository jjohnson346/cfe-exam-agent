MAGNETIC AND ELECTRET MICROPHONES 
Magnetic or dynamic microphones can be very  small. They are useful when a microphone 
needs to be close to the speakers and hidden inside something small. Electret microphones 
also provide good close range coverage. Both types of microphones are smaller than the 
standard carbon microphone, though they tend to offer a lower range of coverage.
