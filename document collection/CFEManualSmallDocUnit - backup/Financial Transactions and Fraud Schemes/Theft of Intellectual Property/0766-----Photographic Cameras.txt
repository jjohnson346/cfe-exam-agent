Photographic Cameras 
Almost as ubiquitous as the bug, the miniature camera plays a lead role in the canon of 
spycraft. Many a motion picture has shown the spy, whether af ter military or industrial

today, industrial spies can sneak out of a company’s premises with numerous secrets tucked 
away in a purse or shirt pocket.
