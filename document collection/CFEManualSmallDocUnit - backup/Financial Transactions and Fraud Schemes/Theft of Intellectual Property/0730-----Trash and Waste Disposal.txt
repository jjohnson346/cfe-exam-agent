Trash and Waste Disposal 
Trash and waste disposal are excellent places to start. Adding a consistent amount of 
shredded, non-sensitive paper to sensitive document waste greatly diminishes the chance of 
traffic analysis. Non-documentary waste should be secured in a locked holding area. From 
there, it can be sorted into uniform shipment modules before release to the waste disposal 
vendor. When the contents of waste shipments are fairly uniform, deciphering plant 
operations from them becomes much more difficult.
