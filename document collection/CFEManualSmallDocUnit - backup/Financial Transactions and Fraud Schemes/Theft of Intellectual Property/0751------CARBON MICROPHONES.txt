CARBON MICROPHONES 
Carbon microphones, while larger than most spy audio devices, provide good pick-up if 
properly hidden and located. They offer excellent coverage of fixed locations: smoke rooms, 
employee lounges, and other gathering spots. As with other forms of listening equipment, 
these microphones are usually equipped with a transmitter that relays intercepted 
conversations off-site to a recorder. This is much safer, from the spy’s perspective, than 
maintaining a recorder on-site. With a remote transmitter, even if the microphone is 
detected, the recorded material cannot be located or recovered by the target.
