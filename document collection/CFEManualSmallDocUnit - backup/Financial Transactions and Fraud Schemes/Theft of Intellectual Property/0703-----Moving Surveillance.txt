Moving Surveillance 
The spy has to be flexible and imaginative in conducting a moving surveillance. For example, 
placing a reflective stripe on the back of the subject’s car makes it more distinctive at night. 
Laying a cheap wristwatch under the rear tire  of the subject’s car will establish when he 
leaves; the broken face will stop the watch at the time they depart. If a subject goes into a 
bar or restaurant, the spy knows to order food or drink and pay for it immediately so that he 
can blend in and to be ready to leave at a moment’s notice.
