Meeting Rooms 
Paging systems, background music speakers, and unused wiring can be used for eaves-
 dropping. Any electronic items and wiring that are not essential should be removed. A 
mirror and a light affixed to a flexible handle can be used to search for recording and 
transmitting devices in air ducts. After the search, when the duct grills are replaced, their 
orientation and screw-head positions can be designated with ultra-violet markers. By shining 
an ultra-violet light on the screws, it is easy to tell if the panels have been removed. Meeting 
rooms should be locked when not in use. If blackboards or flip charts are used, they should 
not face the windows, or the blinds should be closed to prevent observation from telescopes 
or binoculars.
