Recruiting by Justification 
If a spy understands basic psychology, he may be able to convince a recruit that spying is not 
amoral or immoral in his circumstance.  When recruiting by justification, the spy looks for a 
person who thinks of himself as a victim. An employee who is bitter at having been passed 
over for a promotion, for example, provides an excellent prospect for a recruit. Other typical 
targets include employees who feel they have been underpaid or unrecognized by their 
employer, and who harbor a great deal of resentment because of it. Under the right 
conditions, these employees may agree with a spy that the time is ripe for them to look after 
themselves.
