CHECKING FOR UNSECURED WORK AREAS 
Security personnel should also study the way employees’ work areas are maintained. Are 
sensitive documents locked up at night? Are the copy machines electronically locked down 
so a special access card is needed to use them? Do sensitive areas such as research labs and 
computer media libraries have their own separate alarm systems and access controls? Are 
filing cabinets locked at night? Does security do random patrols of the office areas and the 
plant at night? Are all persons in sensit ive areas challenged for proper credentials?
