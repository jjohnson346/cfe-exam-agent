Headhunter Scams 
In a variation on the fake employment ad scheme, a spy calls a key employee of the target 
while posing as a headhunter with a client who is interested in that employee. The 
“headhunter” asks for a résumé and information about projects on which the employee is 
currently working. An in-depth interview by the “client” can provide additional details. This 
method allows the spy to target key employees more directly than simply running fake 
employment ads.
