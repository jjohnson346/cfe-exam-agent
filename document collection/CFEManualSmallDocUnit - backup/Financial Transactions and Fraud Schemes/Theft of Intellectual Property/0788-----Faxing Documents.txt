Faxing Documents 
Sensitive documents should not be sent through the fax machine unless both machines are 
equipped with a high-level encryption device. Some fax machines are equipped with a 
storage and retrieval system similar to that of voicemail systems. From a remote number, 
you enter a PIN number and stored faxes can be sent to another machine. This allows a 
competitor to be able to retrieve those faxes as well.
