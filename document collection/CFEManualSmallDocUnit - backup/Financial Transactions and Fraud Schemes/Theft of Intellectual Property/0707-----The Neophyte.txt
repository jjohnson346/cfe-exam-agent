The Neophyte
In one of the most common social engineering schemes, the spy calls the help desk of a 
target company and claims to be a new employee on his first day at work. The spy complains 
that he has not yet been given a password and so he has been unable to start his computer 
and begin working. The help desk employee gives the spy a password, thereby enabling him 
to enter the company’s system. Typically, the spy does not call the help desk directly in this 
type of scheme. Instead, he calls another department and asks to be transferred to the help 
desk so the call appears to be internal.
