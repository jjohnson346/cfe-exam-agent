INDUSTRIAL REPORTS AND STUDIES 
State and federal governments periodically issue industrial reports and studies on various 
industries ranging from appliance manufacturers to high technology companies. These 
studies provide statistical benchmarks useful to establish where a company stands in its 
industry. In addition, they help delineate the standards for evaluating successful companies 
in that industry. State industrial directories, special industry issues in magazines like Fortune 
and Forbes, and directories from trade associations serve the same function.
