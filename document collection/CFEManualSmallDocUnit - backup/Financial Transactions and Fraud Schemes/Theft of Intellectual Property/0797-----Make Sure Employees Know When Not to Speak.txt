Make Sure Employees Know When Not to Speak 
Often, employees are willing to abide by nondisclosure agreements, but they do not 
understand that the information they are communicating may be confidential. For instance, a 
software company employee who worked on product updates attended a trade association 
meeting and entertained the other attendees with war stories about the development process 
and what things worked and what didn’t. The employee was later reprimanded, and seemed 
genuinely unaware that the information he had provided was proprietary information of 
great value to the company’s competitors.
