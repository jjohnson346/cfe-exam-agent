ABOVE THE CEILING 
If an open space exists above the ceiling in your offices, access that area and look around 
with a flashlight. Be on the lookout for everything from sophisticated transmitters to tape 
recorders that are crudely hooked into telephone lines. If listening devices have been placed 
in an attic or in a crawl space above the ceiling, they probably have not been elaborately 
camouflaged. It should not be exceedingly difficult to spot surveillance equipment in these 
areas.  
 
It is a good idea to have the lights turned on in the room below while you search overhead. 
If someone has drilled holes in the ceiling to insert a microphone, the light should shine 
through the ceiling and you will be able to detect the holes. Surveillance personnel frequently 
drill multiple holes before selecting just one as a listening spot or inserting a miniature video 
camera.
