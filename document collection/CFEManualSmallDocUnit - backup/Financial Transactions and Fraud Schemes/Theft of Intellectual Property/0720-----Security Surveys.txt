Security Surveys  
Frequent security surveys help reveal potential weaknesses and new threats to any 
organization. They offer insight on where and how attacks might happen, and if a company 
suspects that it has already been infiltrated by a spy, a security survey can help determine 
how that infiltration could have occurred and help focus the investigation on the most 
probable techniques. These surveys provide the security professional with a chance to see 
the business through the eyes of an information thief. A perceptive security manager 
analyzes the company’s business in a creative way, looking through a spy’s eyes for pathways 
to information that might otherwise have been overlooked. If a manager wishes to deceive 
potential information thieves, security surveys can tell where the pickings for a thief are best 
and where to leave the bait.
