Environmental Impact Statements 
Environmental impact statements contain large amounts of historical, financial, and 
operational information. The company filing the statement not only has to supply this 
background data on itself, but it also has to explain its proposed project in detail. Those 
details on emissions, hazardous materials used, and possible accidents stemming from 
operations provide a wealth of facts for analysis by an expert. From such analysis a CI 
professional can develop an excellent picture on the size and operational capability of a plant 
or company. Very often, this kind of information can allow one’s competitors to establish 
the date operations will begin at a targeted plant.
