Exit Interviews
One of the most effective ways to protect a company’s trade secrets and confidential 
business information is to conduct an exit interview. During the exit interview, the departing 
employee should be specifically advised about the company’s trade secrets and confidential 
business information and the obligation not to disclose or use such information for her own 
benefit or the benefit of others without the express written consent of the company. The 
employee should be given a form to sign stating that during the exit interview the employee 
was once again informed that any proprietary information should not be disclosed and that 
the employee agrees not to disclose any such information without the consent of the 
company.
