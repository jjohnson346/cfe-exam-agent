SPIKE AND CAVITY MICROPHONES 
Spike and cavity microphones work best when the spy has access to an adjoining area and 
needs to penetrate his surveillance into the next room. For example, if a spy has free range in 
a utility room next door or in an adjacent hotel or motel room, a spike microphone can be 
inserted through the adjoining wall to monitor conversations in the target’s room. This type 
of microphone is so small at its insertion point that it is virtually undetectable to the casual 
observer.
