Overhead 
Overhead costs such as advertising derive from manuals discussed earlier such as the 
Standard Rate and Data Service. Calculating utility costs is as simple as calling the local 
electric, gas, or water company. While a utility company may not reveal what the target 
consumes directly, it will disclose what an average company of that size in that industry 
purchases annually. Newspaper ads and real estate brokers serve as sources on the costs of 
leased plant facilities. The local tax assessor can supply the value of property owned by the 
target. Mortgage information will be available from real estate records at the county clerk’s 
office. 
 
Debts of the targeted business emerge from researching UCC filings, bond rating manuals, 
state economic commission records (if the target is big enough), and from the state securities 
board file of privately placed prospectuses.
