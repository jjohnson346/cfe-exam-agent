MULTIPLE LAYERS OF SECURITY 
There should be multiple layers of security protecting the most sensitive information. The 
layers should become progressively harder to penetrate as one gets closer to the most 
sensitive information. Does the organization have more than one layer of protection for its 
information, and is each layer effective? Or is perimeter security the only real impediment? If 
multiple layers exist, do they offer real impediments to spies, or are they minor hurdles?
