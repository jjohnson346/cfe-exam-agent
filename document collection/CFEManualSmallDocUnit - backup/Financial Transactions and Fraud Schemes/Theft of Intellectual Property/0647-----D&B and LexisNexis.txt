D&B and LexisNexis 
D&B’s and LexisNexis’s business and marketing databases employ conventional search 
technologies that both fall in the upper tier due to their vastness. A starting point for 
researching almost any business is a D&B report.  If the report is lacking, there is probably 
not much out there on that company. With millions of records, these databases are useful in 
developing histories and backgrounds on companies and officers. LexisNexis has so many 
periodicals and transcripts on its database that it is one of the best commercial intelligence 
databases in the world.
