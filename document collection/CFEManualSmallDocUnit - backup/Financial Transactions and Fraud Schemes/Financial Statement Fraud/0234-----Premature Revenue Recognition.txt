Financial Statement Fraud


:


Premature Revenue Recognition)  
Financial statement fraud might also involve timing differences, that is, the recording of 
revenues or expenses in improper periods. This can be done to shift revenues or expenses 
between one period and the next, increasing or decreasing earnings as desired. 
 
Premature Revenue Recognition 
As previously mentioned, revenue should be recognized in the accounting records when the 
following four criteria as set out in FASB ASC 605-10-S99 have been satisfied: 
• Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 
• Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 
• The seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and 
• Collectibility is reasonably assured. 
 
One or more of these criteria is typically  not met when managers recognize revenues 
prematurely. Examples of common problems with premature revenue recognition are set 
out below.
