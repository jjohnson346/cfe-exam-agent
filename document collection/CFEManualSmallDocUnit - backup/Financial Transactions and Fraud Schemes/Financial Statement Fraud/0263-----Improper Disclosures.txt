Improper Disclosures 
Accounting principles require that financial statements include all the information necessary 
to prevent a reasonably discerning user of the financial statements from being misled. The 
notes should include narrative disclosures, supporting schedules, and any other information 
required to avoid misleading potential investors, creditors, or any other users of the financial 
statements.  
 
Management has an obligation to disclose all significant information appropriately in the 
financial statements and in management’s discussion and analysis. In addition, the disclosed
