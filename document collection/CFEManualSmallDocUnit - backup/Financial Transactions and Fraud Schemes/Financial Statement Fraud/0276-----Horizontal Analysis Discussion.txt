Horizontal Analysis Discussion 
Horizontal statement analysis uses percentage comparison from one accounting period to the 
next. The percentage change is calculated by dividing the amount of increase or decrease for 
each item by the base period amount. The resulting percentages are then studied in detail. It 
is important to consider the amount of change as well as the percentage in horizontal 
comparisons. A 5 percent change in an account with a very large dollar amount may actually 
be much more of a change than a 50 percent change in an account with much less activity. 
 
In the above example, it is obvious that the 80 percent increase in sales has a much greater 
corresponding increase in cost of goods sold, which rose 140 percent. These accounts are 
often used to hide fraudulent expenses, withdrawals, or other illegal transactions.
