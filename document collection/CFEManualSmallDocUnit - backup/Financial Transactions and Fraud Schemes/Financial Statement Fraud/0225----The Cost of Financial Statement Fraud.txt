The Cost of Financial Statement Fraud 
Financial statement fraud frequently has a devastating impact on the reputation and the 
financial position of organizations and people involved. The stock market capitalization of 
companies affected by financial statement fraud may fall substantially almost overnight, 
losing billions of dollars for investors. A 2006 report by the United States Government 
Accountability Office (GAO-06-678) found that in the three trading days surrounding the 
initial announcement of a restatement, the companies studied lost an adjusted amount of $36 
billion in market capitalization.

Many jobs may be lost as companies restructu re to try to restore profitability. As media 
interviews of former Enron employees showed, financial statement fraud can exert a high 
toll on the well-being of employees, who may lose their jobs, their pensions, their savings 
invested in their employer’s stock, and health care and other benefits. The company’s 
auditors are likely to be sued for the amount of investors’ losses, which these days may mean 
tens of billions of dollars for large public companies. For large and small companies alike, 
financial statement fraud can be hugely costly and, potentially, a corporate deathblow.
