Financial Statement Fraud


:


MISREPRESENTING THE VALUE OF FIXED ASSETS 
Fixed assets should be recorded at cost. Although assets may appreciate in value, this 
increase in value should not be recognized on company financial statements. Many financial 
statement frauds have involved the reporting of fixed assets at market values instead of the 
lower acquisition costs, or at even higher inflated values with phony valuations to support 
them. Further, companies may falsely inflate the value of fixed assets by failing to record 
impairments of long-lived assets (as required by FASB ASC 350-30-35) and of goodwill (as 
required by FASB ASC 350-20-35). Misrepresentat ion of asset values frequently goes hand 
in hand with other schemes.  
 
EXAMPLE 
In October 2002, the SEC filed a civil enforcement action against former Enron CFO 
Andrew S. Fastow, who also faced criminal charges, relating to an alleged self-enriching 
scheme to defraud Enron’s security holders through the use of  certain off-balance-sheet 
entities. One of the six transactions in the SEC’s complaint against Andrew Fastow 
involved Raptor I and Avici. According to the complaint, Enron and the Fastow-
 controlled partnership LJM2 engaged in complex transactions with an entity called Raptor 
I. Raptor I was used to manipulate Enron’s balance sheet and income statement and to 
generate profits for LJM2 and Fastow at Enron’s expense. In September 2000, Fastow 
and others used Raptor I to effectuate a fraudulent hedging transact ion and thus avoid a 
decrease in the value of Enron’s investment in  the stock of a public company called Avici 
Systems Inc. Specifically, Fastow and others back-dated documents to make it appear that 
Enron had locked in the value of its investment in Avici in August of 2000, when Avici’s 
stock was trading at its all time high price.
