Financial Statement Fraud

Subsequent Events 
Events occurring or becoming known after the close of the period may have a significant 
effect on the financial statements and should be disclosed. Fraudsters typically avoid 
disclosing court judgments and regulatory decisions that undermine the reported values of 
assets, that indicate unrecorded liabilities, or that adversely reflect upon management 
integrity. Public record searches can reveal this information.
