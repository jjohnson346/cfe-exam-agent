FINANCIAL STATEMENT FRAUD 
 
Financial statement schemes are one of a large category of frauds that fall under the heading 
of Occupational Fraud and Abuse, which is defined as “the use of one’s occupation for personal 
enrichment through the deliberate misuse or misapplication of the employing organization’s 
resources or assets.” Simply stated, occupational frauds are those in which an employee, 
manager, officer, or owner of an organization commits fraud to the detriment of that 
organization. The three major types of occupational fraud are: Corruption, Asset 
Misappropriation, and Fraudulent Statements (which include financial statement schemes). 
The complete classification of occupational fraud is shown below:
