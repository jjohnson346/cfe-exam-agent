Long-Term Contracts 
Long-term contracts pose special problems for revenue recognition. Long-term construction 
contracts, for example, use either the completed-contract method or the percentage-of-completion 
method, depending partly on the circumstances. The completed-contract 
method does not record revenue until the project is 100 percent complete. Construction 
costs are held in an inventory account until completion of the project. The percentage-of-completion 
method recognizes revenues and expenses as measurable progress on a project is 
made, but this method is particularly vulnerable to manipulation. Managers can often easily 
manipulate the percentage-of-completion and the estimated costs to complete a construction 
project in order to recognize revenues prematurely and conceal contract overruns.
