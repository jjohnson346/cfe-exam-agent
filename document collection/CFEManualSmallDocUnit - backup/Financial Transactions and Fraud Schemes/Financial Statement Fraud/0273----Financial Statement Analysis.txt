Financial Statement Analysis  
Comparative financial statements provide information for current and past accounting 
periods. Accounts expressed in whole dollar amounts yield a limited amount of information. 
The conversion of these numbers into ratios or percentages allows the reader of the 
statements to analyze them based on their relationship to each other; in addition, it allows 
the reader to more readily compare current performance with past performance. In fraud 
detection and investigation, the determination of the reasons for relationships and changes 
in amounts can be important. These determinations are the red flags that point an examiner 
in the direction of possible fraud. If large enough, a fraudulent misstatement will affect the 
financial statements in such a way that relationships between the numbers become 
questionable. Many schemes are detected because  the financial statements, when analyzed 
closely, do not make sense. Financial statement analysis includes the following: 
• Vertical analysis 
• Horizontal analysis 
• Ratio analysis
