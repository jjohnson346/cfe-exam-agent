Fictitious Sales and Accounts Receivable 
When the perpetrator makes an adjusting entry to the perpetual inventory and cost of sales 
accounts as discussed above, there is no sales transaction on the books that corresponds to 
these entries. In order to fix this problem, a perpetrator might enter a debit to accounts 
receivable and a corresponding credit to the sales account so that it appears the missing 
goods have been sold.  
 
Of course, the problem of payment then arises, because no one is going to pay for the goods 
that were “sold” in this transaction. There are two routes that a fraudster might take in this 
circumstance. The first is to charge the sale to an existing account. In some cases, employees

charge fake sales to existing receivables that are so large that the addition of the assets that 
the perpetrator has stolen will not be noticed. Other corrupt employees charge the “sales” to 
accounts that are already aging and will soon be written off. When these accounts are 
removed from the books, the perpetrator’s stolen  inventory effectively disappears. The other 
adjustment that is typically made is a write-off to discounts and allowances or bad debt expense.
