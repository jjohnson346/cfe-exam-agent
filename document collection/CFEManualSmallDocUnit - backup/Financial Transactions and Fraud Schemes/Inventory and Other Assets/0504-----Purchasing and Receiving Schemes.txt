Purchasing and Receiving Schemes 
Dishonest employees can also manipulate the purchasing and receiving functions of a 
company to facilitate the theft of inventory and other assets. It might seem that any 
purchasing scheme should fall under the heading of false billings, which were discussed 
earlier. There is, however, a distinction between the purchasing schemes that are classified as 
false billings and those that are classified as non-cash misappropriations.  
 
Financial Transactions  Asset Misappro priation: Inventory and Other Assets 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.607 
If an employee causes his company to purchase merchandise that the company does not 
need, this is a false billing scheme. The harm to the company comes in paying for assets for 
which it has no use. On the other hand, if the assets were intentionally purchased by the 
company and later misappropriated by the perpetrator, this is classified as an inventory 
larceny scheme. Here the company loses both the value of the merchandise and the use of 
the merchandise.
