Computer Viruses 
Viruses are hidden computer programs that use all the computer’s resources, thereby 
shutting down the system or slowing it down significantly. Computer viruses typically use 
the infected computer’s resources to replicate itself and spread the infection to other 
computer systems on a network or through the Internet via e-mail. Computer viruses range 
from the relatively harmless (displaying a message or greeting) to shut-downs of entire 
computer networks for extended periods. 
 
A computer virus is a program that contains instruction codes to attack software. The attack 
might erase data or display a message on the screen. The computer virus can copy itself to 
other programs. This copy ability can affect large networks. In recent years, viruses have 
disrupted large networks and caused the expenditure of millions of dollars in staff and 
machine hours to remove these viruses and restore normal operations.
