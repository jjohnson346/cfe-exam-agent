Encrypted Files 
Should the fraud examiner come across files that have been encrypted during the analysis of 
seized computer media, several considerations arise. 
 
First of all, utility programs exist to decrypt documents encrypted by many of the more 
common business software applications, such as Microsoft Word and WordPerfect. There 
are also several companies who specialize in this type of decryption. 
 
Secondly, there is precedent for forcing the suspect to divulge the decryption code through a 
court order. Consider once again that the computer is only a container and that the 
encryption is an additional “lock” that is prohibiting the fraud examiner from reviewing the 
contents for potential evidence. If a valid search warrant exists authorizing the examination 
of the data, this would be no different than a court ordering a suspect to unlock a file cabinet 
to allow the inspection of its contents.
