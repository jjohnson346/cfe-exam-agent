Boot Sector Viruses 
The boot sector is the first logical sector of a hard disk or floppy disk. Seventy-five to 90 
percent of viruses have been boot sector viruses. These viruses use system BIOS, replace the 
boot sector, and move the boot sector to another location. It then writes a copy of its own 
program code that will run every time the system is booted or when programs are being run. 
A boot sector cannot infect a computer if it is introduced after the machine is running the 
operating system. An example of a boot sector virus is Parity Boot. This virus’s payload 
displays the message “Parity Check” and fr eezes the operating system, rendering the 
computer useless. This virus message is taken from an actual error message that is displayed 
to users when a computer’s memory is faulty. As a result, a user whose computer is infected 
with the Parity Boot virus is led to believe that the machine has a memory fault rather than a 
disruptive virus infection.
