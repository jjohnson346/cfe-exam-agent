Conventional Disk Scanners 
This is the standard virus check program. It is run when the user requests it, and it scans the 
contents of the disk, directories, or files that the user wants, for any boot sectors and/or files 
that contain viruses that it recognizes based on the virus description information in its virus 
definition files. Usually run manually by the user either as a preventative maintenance activity 
or when a virus is suspected, scanning can also be automated through the use of a program 
scheduler.
