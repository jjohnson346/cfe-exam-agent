Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1030) 
Most computer crimes are prosecuted under traditional fraud, theft, and embezzlement 
statutes. A statute enacted in 1984, Title 18, U.S. Code, section 1030, makes certain 
computer-related activity a specific federal offense. More information on section 1030 is set 
out in the “Law Related to Fraud” chapter in the Law section of the Fraud Examiners  Manual. 
 
In brief, section 1030(a) prohibits seven acts involving “protected computers.”  
 
A protected computer, under this section, includes: 
• A computer that is used exclusively by a financial institution or the United States 
government. 
• Any computer the use of which affects a computer used by a financial institution or the 
federal government. 
• A computer that is used in interstate or foreign commerce or communication. 
 
Briefly, section 1030(a) prohibits using a protected computer:

• To commit espionage (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(1));  
• To obtain, without authorization, certain government, financial institution, or 
commercial information (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2)); 
• To access, without authorization, a government computer (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(3)); 
• To commit fraud ((18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4));  
• To transmit a program, code, or command to damage a protected computer or to access 
a protected computer that results in damage (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)) 
• For trafficking in passwords (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(6)); 
• To transmit extortionate threats (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(7).  
 
Sections 1030(a)(5) and 1030(a)(4) are discussed in further detail below.  
 
COMPUTER FRAUD (TITLE 18, U.S. CODE, SECTION 1030(a)(4)) 
As noted above, section 1030(a)(4) outlaws fraud involving protected computers. There are 
three elements of the crime, which include: 
• Knowingly accessing a protected computer without authorization (or exceeding 
authorization); 
• With the intent to defraud; and  
• Thereby obtaining anything of value (more than $5,000 over the course of a year). 
 
CAUSING COMPUTER DAMAGE (TITLE 18, U.S. CODE SECTION 1030(a)(5)) 
Section 1030(a)(5), which applies to computers used in interstate or foreign commerce or 
communication, outlaws causing computer damage. But it contains two categories of 
offense, depending on intent. The first category provides that it is illegal to knowingly 
transmit a program, code, or command that intentionally causes damage a protected 
computer. This offense applies even if the individual had authorization to access the 
computer.  
 
The second category provides that it is illegal to access a protected computer, without 
authorization, that results in damage. Unlike the first category, this offense does not require 
intent to damage, only the intent to access the information.  
 
Unlawful actions under the first category of section 1030(a)(5) violations include 
imprisonment up to one year and/or a fine. Violators under the second category of section 
1030(a)(5) may receive up to five years imprisonment (not more than 10 years for repeat

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1865 
offenders) and/or a fine. Both categories provide a civil remedy for any person who suffers 
damage as a result of a violation of section 1030(a)(5).  
 
To apply, section 1030(a)(5) requires that the defendant’s conduct “cause” damage to a 
computer. Due to its broadness, the definition allows section 1030(a)(5) to apply in various 
situations, including instances where an act causes information to be deleted or changed, 
where an intruder alters the way a computer operates, or where an act makes information 
unavailable. Even if an intruder did not make any alterations and the computer system works 
as it did before, some courts have ruled that accessing and copying private data from 
protected computers may cause damage to the data under section 1035(a)(5).
