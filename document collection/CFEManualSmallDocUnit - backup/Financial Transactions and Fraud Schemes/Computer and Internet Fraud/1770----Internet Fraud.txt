Internet Fraud 
A booming segment of computer fraud, Internet fraud has become a growing concern to the 
law enforcement community. This type of fraud has proliferated and will continue to 
proliferate because of the ripe conditions that exist on the World Wide Web for fraudulent 
activities. The Internet is still a developing technology for much of international business 
and thus has not been subjected to much litigation or policing. The laws that do currently 
apply to the Internet are difficult to enforce, since the Internet crosses virtually every 
international border on the planet. The lack of international laws and the difficulty enforcing 
those laws gives Internet fraudsters a better than average chance of avoiding capture  
and punishment.  
 
For consumers to retain their confidence in Internet transactions, the perception that the 
Internet is a safe way to shop and do business must be fostered. Consumer awareness of 
online fraud must be raised without causing a loss of consumer confidence. This difficult 
endeavor may require an unprecedented effort by the private sector in conjunction with law 
enforcement. Consequently, private investigative resources may be called upon in greater 
numbers than ever, given law enforcement’s deficiencies in the area of computer fraud.
