Criminal Infringement of a Copyright (Title 17, U.S. Code, Section 506 and Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 2319) 
Title 17, U.S. Code, section 506, criminalizes willful copyright infringement and defines what 
conduct is prohibited, while Title 18, U.S. Code, section 2319, imposes the criminal 
punishment for a copyright infringement conviction, which is to be added to any other 
penalties imposed by other provisions or laws. 
 
Copyright law grants copyright holders six exclusive rights to their works, including the right 
to reproduction. Generally, infringement occurs if an individual exercises any one of the 
copyright holder’s exclusive rights without authorization or other legal authority. However, 
not all infringements are criminal offenses. Instead, section 506 provides that copyright 
infringement is criminal if an individual willfully reproduces or distributes, for commercial 
advantage or private financial gain, one or more copies of copyrighted works totaling in 
retail value $1,000 or more.  
 
Section 2319 imposes punishment for both felony and misdemeanor crimes. Felony 
penalties attach when the infringement consists of the reproduction or distribution of 10 or 
more copies of copyrighted works within 180 days that, taken together, are worth more than 
$2,500, or when the violation involves distribution of a “work being prepared for 
commercial distribution” over “a computer network accessible to members of the public.” 
Alternatively, misdemeanor crimes attach when the infringement consisted of any of  
the following: 
• Infringement of reproduction or distribution rights for private financial gain or 
commercial advantage, regardless of the exact volume or value of the infringement;  
• Infringement of reproduction or distribution rights of one or more copies of 
copyrighted works within 180 days that are worth a total retail value of $1,000 or more, 
and it does not involve private financial gain or commercial advantage; or  
• Infringement of rights other than reproduction or distribution for private financial gain 
or commercial advantage 
 
In 1997, President Clinton signed The No Electronic Theft Act into law, which amended the 
copyright laws to prohibit electronic infringements and extended the copyright infringement 
to include acts that do not necessarily give rise to a profit.
