Keyword Search 
Due to the tremendous storage capacity of contemporary computer media, it might be more 
cost effective for the fraud examiner to conduct a “keyword search” of the media, searching 
for key words, names, dates, account numbers, etc. that are material to the fraud case. This 
will minimize the amount of time used to complete the analysis, and also protects the fraud 
examiner from possible allegations that their search was overly broad.
