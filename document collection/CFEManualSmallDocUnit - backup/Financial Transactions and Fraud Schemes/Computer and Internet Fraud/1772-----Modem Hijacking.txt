Modem Hijacking 
According to the Federal Trade Commission, this scheme is designed to exploit Internet 
users. While users are online, their computer modems are secretly disconnected from their 
ISP and reconnected to the Internet, only this time through an expensive international line. 
Victims have usually downloaded a special “viewer” program from a website offering free 
computer images. Once activated, the downloaded material began the hijacking 
disconnection and reconnection process. Long-distance charges continued to mount until 
victims shut down their computers, even if their Internet connection had already been 
terminated.
