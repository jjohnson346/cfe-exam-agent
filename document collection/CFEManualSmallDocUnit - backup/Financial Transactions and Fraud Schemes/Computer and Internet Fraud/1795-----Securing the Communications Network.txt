Securing the Communications Network 
Some communications networks are very large, very complex, and technically demanding. 
The task of effectively securing these networks is demanding and requires the close 
cooperation of both network and security administration. The objective of data and voice 
networks is to provide connectivity with acceptable response times, user-friendly access, and 
a secure mode at an acceptable cost to the organization.
