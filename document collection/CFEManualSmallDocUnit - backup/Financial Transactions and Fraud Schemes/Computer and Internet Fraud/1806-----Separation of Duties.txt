Separation of Duties 
Separation of duties is a key element in a well-designed internal control system. It is also 
fundamental to detecting and preventing fraud. Programmers should not operate the 
computer, have unsupervised access to production programs, or have access to production 
data sets (data files). Users should not have access to the production program code. 
Computer operators should not perform computer programming. Adequate supervision 
should be provided by personnel who do not actually perform the work.
