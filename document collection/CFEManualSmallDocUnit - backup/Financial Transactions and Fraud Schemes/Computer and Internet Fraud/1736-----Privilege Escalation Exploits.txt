Privilege Escalation Exploits 
Privilege escalation exploits grant administrator or root-level access to users who previously 
did not have such access. For example, an account exists on all Windows NT and 2000 
servers called “Guest.” This account, by default, has no password. Anyone can log-in to the 
server using this “Guest” account and then use a common privilege escalation exploit called 
“GetAdmin” to gain administrator-level access to the system. Many other privilege escalation 
exploits exist, such as HackDLL and others. These exploits are very useful, since they allow 
anyone who has any level of access to a system to easily elevate their privilege level and 
perform any activities they desire.
