Mutation Engine Viruses 
This modern day virus uses a special language-driven algorithm generator that enables it to 
create an infinite variety of original encryption algorithms. It avoids the checksum detection 
method, like stealth viruses, by not changing the infected file size. Each time they replicate, 
they produce a new and different code.
