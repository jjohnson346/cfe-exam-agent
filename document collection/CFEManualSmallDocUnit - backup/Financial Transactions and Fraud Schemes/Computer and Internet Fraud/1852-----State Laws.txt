State Laws 
At the state level, statutes that might be of use in prosecuting computer crimes would 
include the penal code violations of larceny (in its many forms), false pretenses, forgery, 
fraud, embezzlement, vandalism, property destruction, malicious mischief, proprietary 
information, theft, commercial bribery, and extortion. But most states now expressly provide 
penalties for crimes perpetrated by use of computers or perpetrated against computers. See 
the Law section for a complete listing of state computer fraud statutes.
