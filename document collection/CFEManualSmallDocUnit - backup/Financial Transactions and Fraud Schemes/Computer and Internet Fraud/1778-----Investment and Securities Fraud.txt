Computer and Internet Fraud

Investment and Securities Fraud 
Websites that offer investment or securities advice are not in short supply. Many of these 
sites are reputable, but an illicit cottage industry has been born on many of these sites. A 
fraudulent website will claim to have insider information about the value of a given stock, 
suggesting that something unexpected will soon happen to that company. When the 
unknowing stock investor takes the advice of the supposedly knowledgeable investment 
advisor, the advisor manipulates the stock price to his advantage.
