The Risk Assessment Process 
As organizations grow, their information technology and data change both in type and 
quantity. Assumptions made about security need to be updated. The vehicle for updating is 
the risk assessment. This is a zero-based process that should be performed periodically. A 
risk assessment is an analysis of the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity,  
and availability. 
 
Each data element should be examined to determine the impact if it is disclosed, lost, or 
entered incorrectly. Once this information is collected, the security measures in place should 
be reviewed to determine whether they provide necessary safeguards. The risk assessment 
process is a time-consuming process to undertake and many organizations employ outside 
security consultants to reduce its impact on day-to-day operations.
