Limitations on Exclusive Rights: Computer Programs (Title 17, U.S. Code, Section 117) 
Although copyright laws provide copyright holders the exclusive right to reproduction, this 
right is subject to a number of limitations, including section 117, which allows the copying of 
copyrighted software in limited circumstances. Under section 117, the owner of a copy of a 
computer program is allowed to make additional copies of such program in two instances. 
First, owners may copy a computer program if it is necessary for the use of the computer 
program. Second, users may make a copy for archival purposes to prevent loss due to hard 
drive failures and the like.  
 
Even though the law authorizes copies made under section 117’s limitations, there are 
restrictions. All copies must be destroyed when the possession of a computer program 
ceases to be deemed rightful. Furthermore, any copies made in accordance with this section 
may be transferred but must be accompanied by the original program from which copies 
were made and with all rights in the program.
