Parasitic Viruses 
Parasitic viruses attach themselves to programs known as executables. When a user launches 
a program that has a parasitic virus, the virus is surreptitiously launched first. To cloak its 
presence from the user, the virus then triggers the original program to open. The parasitic 
virus, because the operating system understands it to be part of the program, is given the 
same rights as the program to which the virus is attached. These rights allow the virus to 
replicate, install itself into memory, or release its payload. In the absence of antivirus 
software, only the payload might raise the normal user’s suspicions. A famous parasitic virus 
called Jerusalem has a payload of slowing down the sy stem and eventually deleting every 
program the user launches.
