Passwords 
Passwords are the predominant form of authenticating valid users. Effective password 
administration is essential for maintaining security. Passwords should be of sufficient length 
(usually a minimum of eight characters) and a combination of letters, numbers, and other 
characters, such as punctuation marks to avoid guessing. Group passwords and sharing of 
passwords should be prohibited so as to maintain individual accountability. Passwords of all 
terminated employees should be revoked immediately. Security administration often 
coordinates the notification of terminated employees with the personnel function. 
Employees who have changed job functions or transferred should have their old passwords 
canceled and new ones issued, if appropriate.
