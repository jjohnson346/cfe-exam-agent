Systems Maintenance 
All program and system changes should be approved in writing. Programmers should not 
have access to the production library, but only to “test” libraries. All programs that are to be 
modified should be moved into a test library by someone other than a programmer. All 
completed program changes should be tested and the results approved by both data center 
and user personnel before being placed into production. Adequate program documentation 
should be approved for all program changes. User personnel should be notified when 
modified programs will be placed into production.
