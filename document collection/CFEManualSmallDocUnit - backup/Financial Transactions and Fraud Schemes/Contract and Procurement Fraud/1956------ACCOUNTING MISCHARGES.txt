ACCOUNTING MISCHARGES 
Accounting mischarges  are defined as knowingly charging unallowable costs to the buyer, 
concealing or misrepresenting them as allowable costs, or hiding them in accounts (such as 
office supplies) that are not usually audited closely. Another common variation involves 
charging types of costs or independent research and development to other cost categories.
