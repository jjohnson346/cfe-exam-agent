Bid Specifications 
Bid specifications and statements of work detailing the types and amounts of goods and 
services to be provided are prepared to assist in the selection process. They are intended to 
provide both potential bidders and the selecting officials with a firm basis for making and 
accepting bids. 
 
A well-written contract will contain specifications, standards, and statements of work that 
clearly detail the rights and entitlements of the contractor. Carelessly written specifications, 
standards, and statements of work make it easier for a contractor to claim at a later time that 
he is entitled to more money than the buyer intended to pay. 
 
Sometimes, the buyer’s personnel and the contractor deliberately collude to write vague 
specifications. At other times, there is an agreement to amend the contract to increase the 
price immediately after the award. One contractor actually developed a “cost enhancement 
plan,” which identified all the changes he would make in order to double the cost of the 
contract, before it was even signed.
