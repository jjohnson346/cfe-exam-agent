DETECTION - BID SPECIFICATIONS  
The following is a list of potential red flags for frauds involving specifications: 
• Providing the contractor with information or advice on a preferential basis. 
• Using statements of work, specification, or sole source justifications developed by, or in 
consultation with, a contractor who will be permitted to bid. 
• Permitting consultants who assisted in the preparation of the statements of work, 
specifications, or design to perform on the contract as subcontractors or consultants. 
• Splitting costs into separate categories to avoid review. 
• Writing specifications not consistent with past similar procurement.
