Financial Institution Fraud


:


Crime Control Act of 1990, Title 12, U.S. Code, § 1821(d)(17)-(19) 
This Act defines a host of crimes and increases the maximum penalties on other offenses. 
For example, the maximum prison term for financial crimes was increased from 5 years to 
20 years. These penalties, however, do not become effective for offenses committed prior to 
the effective date of this law. Thus far, no court decisions have been made regarding these 
increased penalties. This statute amended the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization 
law (RICO), making bank fraud a predicate offense under RICO.
