Moving Money from Customers’ Dormant or Inactive Accounts 
Persons with apparent authority create journal entries or transfer orders not initiated by 
customers to move money among accounts. Dormant or inactive accounts are those that show 
little or no activity. Often contact with the account holder by confirmation, letter, or 
telephone contact is not possible. Such accounts are to be transferred to dual control and 
recorded in an inactive accounts ledger. State statutes usually provide for escheat or 
forfeiture to the state after a period of years.
