Advanced Fee Fraud  
Banks find deals that seem “too good to be true” to gain access to large amounts of money 
(deposits) at below-market interest rates. The catch is that the bank must pay an up-front 
finder’s fee to a person claiming to have access to the money. In some cases, desperate 
institutions are offered access to illegal money, and they typically do not report the loss of 
the advance fee when the deal falls through. More information on advance fee swindles can 
be found in the “Consumer Fraud” chapter. 
 
EXAMPLE 
The bank is contacted by an agent (such as a broker, advisor, consultant, promoter, lawyer, 
or bank customer) offering to provide money at a below-market interest rate for a long 
period of time (e.g., 10–20 years). The agent asks for a large fee to close the deal. The 
agent takes the fee and disappears. The deposits might or might not exist; and if they do, 
they seldom equate to the agent’s representations.
