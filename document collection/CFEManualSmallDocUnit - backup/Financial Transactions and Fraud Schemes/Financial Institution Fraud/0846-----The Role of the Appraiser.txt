The Role of the Appraiser 
The appraiser performs an independent property valuation for the new (or old) owner. 
Appraisers should be licensed. They should also be certified by an independent professional 
association. There are several professional associations for real estate appraisers. A list of 
these organizations can be found at the end of this section. It is important, particularly in 
regard to complex commercial property, that the appraisers’ experience and credentials be 
carefully scrutinized.
