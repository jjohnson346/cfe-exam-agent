Automated Loan Processing 
The growth of automated loan processing contributed to the increase in mortgage fraud 
because the nature of such transactions is faceless. The use of the Internet to receive and 
process loan applications has grown, and, in such cases, the lenders never meet the 
borrowers. This process creates an environment susceptible to fraudulent activity.
