Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Fraud 
An ATM is a dispensing facility from which the holder of a debit card can draw cash. The 
facility can also perform other services such as depositing funds and checking account 
balances, but the most popular use has been to dispense funds. Fraud schemes have been 
perpetrated involving the unauthorized use of ATM facilities. Schemes include: 
• Theft of card and/or unauthorized access to PIN numbers and account codes for ATM 
transactions by unauthorized persons 
• Employee manipulation 
• Counterfeit ATM cards

EXAMPLE 
A former Citibank employee was sentenced to 41 months in  prison for masterminding a 
scheme to steal $200,000 in cash from several of the bank’s ATMs. The computer expert 
was the No. 2 official in Citibank’s ATM security department, and programmed the 
bank’s money machines to issue money and not leave any record of the transactions. This 
was done by remotely accessing  the company’s mainframe comput er and instructing it to put 
particular machines in “test mode.”
