Embezzlement Schemes 
Embezzlement  is defined as the wrongful taking or conversion of the property of another for 
the wrongdoer’s benefit. Misapplication often accompanies embezzlement, but is a separate 
and distinct offense. Misapplication is the  wrongful taking or conversion of another’s 
property for the benefit of someone else.
