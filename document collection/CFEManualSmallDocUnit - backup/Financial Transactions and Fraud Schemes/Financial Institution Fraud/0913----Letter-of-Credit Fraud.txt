Letter-of-Credit Fraud 
Most letter-of-credit fraud arises from foreig n trade and contracting. Letter-of-credit fraud 
can be perpetrated by beneficiaries using forged or fraudulent documents presented to the 
issuing bank with a demand for payment. The documents, however, must conform to the 
terms of the letter-of-credit agreement. 
 
EXAMPLE 
An American exporter might offer to sell goods to an overseas importer. When terms are 
arranged, a letter of credit is obtained in the exporter’s favor, confirmed by a bank near the 
exporter’s location. (The actual export never occurs, and the request for payment is bogus.)
