Personal Accounts Using Fraudulent Checks 
A similar scheme is to open a new personal account with two checks drawn by other people. 
The checks are either forged or stolen. The fraudster then deposits one, and takes cash for 
the other. Shortly thereafter, the fraudster writes checks to overdraw the deposited amount.
