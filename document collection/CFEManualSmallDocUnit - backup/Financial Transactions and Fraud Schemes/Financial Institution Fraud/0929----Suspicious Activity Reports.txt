Suspicious Activity Reports 
Effective April 1, 1996, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) requires 
national banks to submit a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) under certain circumstances (12 
C.F.R. § 21.11, as amended). SARs are required in each of the following instances: 
• There is a known or suspected criminal violation involving the bank and the bank has a

substantial basis for identifying responsible bank personnel. 
• There is a known or suspected criminal violation involving the bank, the amount 
involved is $5,000 or more, and the bank has a substantial basis for identifying a possible 
suspect. 
• There is a known or suspected criminal violation involving the bank and the amount 
involved is $25,000 or more (if the amount in volved is $25,000 or more, even if the bank 
does not have a substantial basis for identifying a suspect). 
• Any transaction aggregating $5,000 or more that was conducted or attempted to be 
conducted through the bank when the bank has reason to suspect that the funds involve 
potential money laundering, are designed to evade any regulations under the Bank 
Secrecy Act, or involve computer intrusions.  
• Any transaction aggregating $5,000 or more that was conducted or attempted to be 
conducted through the bank when the bank knows that the customer is operating as an 
unlicensed money services business. 
 
In most cases, the SAR must be filed within 30 days of the date of detection. Other financial 
institutions have similar reporting requirements, including: 
• Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) - 12 C.F.R. § 353 
• Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) - 12 C.F.R. § 563.180 
• National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) - 12 C.F.R. § 748
