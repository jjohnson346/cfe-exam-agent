Mortgage Fraud 
Fraud has always been a constant presence in the mortgage industry, and it appears to be on 
the rise. There are a number of likely factors contributing to this apparent increase, including 
a rapid decline in the rate of home price appreciation, an increase in unemployment, and an 
increase in aggressive lending practices. All of these factors either reduced incentives or 
made it more difficult for borrowers to meet their mortgage obligations, which ultimately led 
to an increase in loan defaults.

The recent mortgage crisis has led to an increase in fraud for several reasons. One reason is 
that the declining housing market affects many in the mortgage industry (especially those 
paid by commission). During such declines, individuals are more likely to commit fraudulent 
acts to maintain their current standard of living. In addition, the declining market provides 
an ideal environment for perpetrators to employ numerous schemes that fit perfectly with 
down market (i.e., an increasing number of foreclosures, declining housing prices, and 
decreasing demand). Such down market characteristics place pressure on home builders, 
sellers, and lenders, which fraud perpetrators will attempt to exploit.
