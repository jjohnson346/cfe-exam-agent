High Turnover in Developer’s Personnel 
One of the first signs to look for, particularly  in construction lending, is whether or not the 
real estate developer is experiencing a higher-than-normal employee turnover. Typically, 
when a developer experiences a high degree of turnover, something is wrong with the 
internal operation. This is often a preamble for other problems to come.
