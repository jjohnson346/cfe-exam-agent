Identity Theft 
An identity theft scheme is defined as the assumption of someone else’s identity for fraudulent 
purposes. Identity theft is recognized as one of the fastest growing crimes in the U.S. Recent 
identity theft reports from credit reporting companies, corporate databases, and commercial 
data brokers indicate a substantial rise in cases of identity theft in conjunction with mortgage 
loan fraud.  
 
Two examples of identity theft schemes involving mortgage fraud include the fraudulent 
acquisition of a person’s home and the fraudulent origination of a loan on a property 
belonging to another person.
