Employee Training 
Fellow employees are generally the first people to recognize unusual transactions or behavior 
changes of other employees. These might be early indicators that a fraud has or will soon 
begin. Employees and managers should be properly trained to recognize these symptoms. 
For example, bank tellers should be adequately schooled in split deposit schemes; new 
account officers in new account schemes and so on.
