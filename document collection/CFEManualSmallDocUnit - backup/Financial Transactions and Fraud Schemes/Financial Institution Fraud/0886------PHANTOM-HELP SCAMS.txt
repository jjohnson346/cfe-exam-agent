PHANTOM-HELP SCAMS 
In a phantom-help scam, the scammer promises to save the homeowner’s credit or get him low 
monthly payments. Instead, the homeowner pays thousands of dollars in fees, and the 
scammer either does nothing or files bankruptcy on behalf of the borrower and absconds 
with the fees.
