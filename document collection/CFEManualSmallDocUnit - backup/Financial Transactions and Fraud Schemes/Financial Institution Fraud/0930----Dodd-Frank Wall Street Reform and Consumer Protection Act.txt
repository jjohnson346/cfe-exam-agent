Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
In the summer of 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
became law, adding new regulations for companies that extend credit to consumers, 
exempting small public companies from Sarbanes-Oxley section 404(b), making auditors of 
broker-dealers subject to PCAOB regulation, and changing registration requirements for 
investment bankers.   
 
New regulations for companies that extend credit to consumers include: 
• Mortgage lenders must make a reasonable effort to ensure the ability to repay before 
issuing a loan to consumers.

• Non-bank entities will be regulated by the Federal Reserve if they believe that the 
entities would have a negative effect on the financial system if the company failed or 
its activities would pose a risk to the financial stability of the US  
• Prohibits the financial incentives for subprime loans that encourage lenders to steer 
borrowers into more costly loans, including the bonuses known as "yield spread 
premiums" that lenders pay to brokers to inflate the cost of loans. Prohibits pre-
 payment penalties that trapped so many borrowers into unaffordable loans.  
• Allows consumers free access to their credit score if their score negatively affects 
them in a financial transaction or a hiring decision. Gives consumers access to credit 
score disclosures as part of an adverse action and risk-based pricing notice.  
 
Additionally, the Act, created the Financial Stability Oversight Council to regulate risk in the 
financial institution industry. It is chaired by the Treasury secretary and includes the Federal 
Reserve chairman, FDIC, and SEC as members of the Council. The Council will have 
authority to break up large firms or veto rules created by another new regulator called the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Bureau consolidates most federal regulation of 
financial services offered to consumers and sits on the FDIC board.
