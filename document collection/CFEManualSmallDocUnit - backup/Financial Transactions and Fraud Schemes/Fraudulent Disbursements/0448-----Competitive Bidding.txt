Competitive Bidding 
Ensure that bid policies and procedures are thoroughly reviewed. Whenever possible, 
enforce competitive bidding. After the bidding process has been completed, a questionnaire 
can be sent to successful and unsuccessful bidders. This questionnaire can reveal areas to not 
only make the bidding process more effective but it also can provide a forum for bidders to 
express concerns over questionable or fraudulent activities.
