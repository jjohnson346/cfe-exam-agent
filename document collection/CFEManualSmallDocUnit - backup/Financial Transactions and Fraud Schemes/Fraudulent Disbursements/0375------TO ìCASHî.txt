TO “CASH”   
The perpetrator may also write checks payable to “cash” in order to avoid listing himself as 
the payee. Checks made payable to cash, however, must still be endorsed. The perpetrator 
will have to sign his own name or forge the name of another in order to convert the check. 
Checks payable to “cash” are usually viewed more  skeptically than checks payable to persons 
or businesses. Some institutions may refuse to cash checks made payable to “cash.”
