Prevention of Billing Schemes 
The preventing of purchasing fraud can be especially difficult. Purchasing personnel are 
often held to a different standard than other employees of a company. For example, sales 
people often are given inducements or perquisites in order to persuade potential customers. 
These same inducements are offered to the purchasing personnel of the company from the 
company’s vendors. And yet, the company ex pects the purchasing personnel to perform 
their function without bias and to make decisions that are in the best interest of the 
company, without regard to the inducements offered by suppliers. Additionally, the 
personnel involved in the purchasing and payment functions are generally not compensated 
on a basis commensurate with their performance, as are salespeople. Therefore, there is a 
reverse incentive to perform in the best interest of the company. 
 
Probably the most effective purchasing fraud prevention measure is education (training) of 
the purchasing and payable personnel. The second most effective purchasing fraud 
prevention measure is an objective compensation arrangement with people responsible for 
purchasing decisions.
