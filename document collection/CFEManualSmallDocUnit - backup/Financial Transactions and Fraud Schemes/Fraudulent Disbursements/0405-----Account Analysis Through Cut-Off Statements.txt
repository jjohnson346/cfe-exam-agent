Account Analysis Through Cut-Off Statements 
Bank cut-off statements should be requested for 10 to 15 days after the closing date of the 
balance sheet. These statements may be used to detect cash fraud during periods between 
monthly bank statements. Cut-off statements are often used by auditors to ensure that 
income and expenses are reported in the proper period. If employees know that at any time 
during the month a cut-off statement may be ordered and reviewed independently, cash 
fraud will be less likely. 
 
A cut-off statement is generally ordered from the bank, delivered unopened to the auditor 
(or outsider), and reconciled. It can be ordered at any time during the accounting cycle. If 
cut-off bank statements are not ordered or received, obtain the following period bank 
statement and perform account analysis and investigation.
