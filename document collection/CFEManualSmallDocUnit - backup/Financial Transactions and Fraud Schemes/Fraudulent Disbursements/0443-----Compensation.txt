Compensation 
People responsible for the purchasing decisions (buyers) should be paid well enough to 
reduce the motive and rationalization for fraud. Auditors can examine the compensation of 
purchasers and determine if any buyers were recently passed over for raises. This might be 
an indication of discontent that could lead to the formation of a fraudulent scheme against 
the employer.
