Altered Sales  
The second way for a fraudster to overstate the amount of sales he has made is to alter the 
prices listed on sales documents. In other words, the perpetrator charges one price to a 
customer, but records a higher price in the company books. This causes the victim company 
to pay a larger commission than the perpetrator deserves. To make these schemes work, the 
employee might have to intercept and alter the invoices that are sent to the customer. (The 
invoices the company sends out will reflect a higher purchase price than the customer agreed 
to, so if the customer receives these invoices he is likely to complain about the discrepancy.) 
The employee may also overstate the revenue received from his customers.
