Personal Purchases Through False Invoicing 
Employees who undertake purchases schemes may do so by running unsanctioned invoices 
through the accounts payable system. The perpetrator in this type of scheme buys an item 
and submits the bill to his employer as if it represented a legitimate company expense. The 
victim company ends up unknowingly buying goods or services for a dishonest employee. 
(See “Invoice Purchasing Schemes” flowchart.)
