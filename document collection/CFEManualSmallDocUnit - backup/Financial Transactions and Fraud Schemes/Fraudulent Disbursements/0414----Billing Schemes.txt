Billing Schemes 
The asset misappropriation schemes discussed up to this point—skimming, larceny, register 
schemes, and check tampering—all require the perpetrator of the scheme to physically take 
cash or checks from his employer. The next three sections will cover a different kind of asset 
misappropriation scheme, one which allows the perpetrator to misappropriate company 
funds without ever actually handling cash or checks while at work. These succeed by making 
a false claim for payment upon the victim organization. This group consists of billing schemes  
(which attack the purchasing function of a company), payroll schemes, and expense reimbursement 
schemes. The most common of these is the billing scheme.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.535 
Billing schemes are a popular form of employee fraud mainly because they offer the 
prospect of large rewards. Since the majority of most businesses’ disbursements are made in 
the purchasing cycle, larger thefts can be hidden through false-billing schemes than through 
other kinds of fraudulent disbursements. There are three principal types of billing schemes: 
false invoicing via shell companies, false invoicing via non-accomplice vendors, and personal 
purchases made with company funds.
