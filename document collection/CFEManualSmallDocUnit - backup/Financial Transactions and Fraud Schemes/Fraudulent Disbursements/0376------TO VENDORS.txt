Fraudulent Disbursements

TO VENDORS 
Not all fraudsters forge company checks to obtain cash. Some employees use forged maker 
schemes to purchase goods or services for their own benefit. These fraudulent checks are 
made payable to third-party vendors who are uninvolved in the fraud. For instance, an 
employee might forge a company check to buy a computer for his home. The computer 
vendor is not involved in the fraud at all. Furthermore, if the victim organization regularly 
does business with this vendor, the person who reconciles the company’s accounts may 
assume that the check was used for a legitimate business expense.
