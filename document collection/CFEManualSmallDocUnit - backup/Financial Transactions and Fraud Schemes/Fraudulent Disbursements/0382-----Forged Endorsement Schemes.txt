Forged Endorsement Schemes 
Forged endorsements are those check tampering schemes in which an employee intercepts a 
company check intended to pay a third party and converts the check by endorsing it in the 
third-party’s name. In some cases the employee also signs his own name as a second 
endorser. (See “Forged Endorsement Schemes” flowchart.) 
 
A fraudster’s main dilemma in a forged endorsement scheme (and in all intercepted check 
schemes, for that matter) is gaining access to a check after it has been signed. The fraudster 
must either steal the check between the point where it is signed and the point where it is 
delivered, or he must re-route the check, causing it to be delivered to a location where he can 
retrieve it. The manner used to steal a check depends largely upon the way the company 
handles outgoing disbursements. Anyone who is allowed to handle signed checks may be in 
a good position to intercept them.
