TO AN ACCOMPLICE  
If a fraudster is working with an accomplice, he can make the forged check payable to that 
person. The accomplice then cashes the check and splits the money with the employee-fraudster. 
Because the check is payable to the accomplice in his true identity, it is easily 
converted. An additional benefit to using an accomplice is that a canceled check payable to a 
third-party accomplice is not as likely to raise suspicion as a canceled check to an employee. 
The obvious drawback to using an accomplice in a scheme is that the employee-fraudster 
usually has to share the proceeds of the scheme.
