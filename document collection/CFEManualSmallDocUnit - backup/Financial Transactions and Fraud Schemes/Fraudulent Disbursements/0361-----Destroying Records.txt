Destroying Records 
One final means of concealing a register scheme, as with many kinds of fraud, is to destroy 
all records of the transaction. Most concealment methods are concerned with keeping 
management from realizing that fraud has occurred. When an employee resorts to destroying 
records, however, he typically has conceded that management will discover his theft. The 
purpose of destroying records is usually to prevent management from determining who the 
thief is.
