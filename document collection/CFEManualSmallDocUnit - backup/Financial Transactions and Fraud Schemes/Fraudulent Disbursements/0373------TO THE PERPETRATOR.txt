TO THE PERPETRATOR 
Once a blank check has been obtained, the perpetrator must decide to whom it should be 
made payable. In most instances forged checks are made payable to the perpetrator himself 
so that they can be easily converted. Canceled checks that are payable to an employee should 
be closely scrutinized for the possibility of fraud.  
 
If the perpetrator owns his own business or has established a shell company, he will usually 
write fraudulent checks to these entities rather than himself. These checks are not as 
obviously fraudulent on their faces as checks made payable to an employee. At the same 
time, these checks are easy to convert because the perpetrator owns the entity to which the 
checks are payable.
