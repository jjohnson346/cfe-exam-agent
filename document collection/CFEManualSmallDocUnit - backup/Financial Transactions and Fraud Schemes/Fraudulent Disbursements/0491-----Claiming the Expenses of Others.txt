Claiming the Expenses of Others 
Another way perpetrators use actual receipts to generate unwarranted reimbursements is by 
submitting expense reports for expenses that were paid by others. For instance, an employee 
might save the receipt from a meal that was paid for by another party, then request 
reimbursement for the meal himself.
