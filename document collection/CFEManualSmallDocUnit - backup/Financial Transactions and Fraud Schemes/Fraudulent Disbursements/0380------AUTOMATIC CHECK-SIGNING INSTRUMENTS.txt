AUTOMATIC CHECK-SIGNING INSTRUMENTS 
Companies that issue a large number of checks sometimes utilize automatic check-signing 
instruments. Automated signatures are either produced with manual instruments like 
signature stamps or they are printed by computer. Obviously, an employee who has access to 
an automatic check-signing instrument will have no trouble forging the signatures of 
authorized makers. Even the most rudimentary control procedures should severely limit 
access to these instruments.  
 
EXAMPLE 
A fiscal officer maintained a set of manual checks that were unknown to other persons in 
the company. The company used an automated check signer and the custodian of the signer 
let the officer have uncontrolled access to it. Using the manual checks and the company’s 
check signer, the fiscal officer was able to write over $90,000 worth of fraudulent checks to 
himself over a period of approximately four years.  
 
The same principle applies to computer-generated signatures. Access to the password or 
program that prints signed checks should be restricted, specifically excluding those who 
prepare checks and those who reconcile the bank statement.
