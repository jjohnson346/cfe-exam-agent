Altered Receipts 
The most fundamental example of an overstated expense reimbursement scheme occurs 
when an employee doctors a receipt or other supporting documentation to reflect a higher 
cost than what he actually paid. The employee may use white-out, a ballpoint pen, or some 
other method to change the price reflected on the receipt before submitting his expense 
report. If the company does not require original documents as support, the perpetrator 
generally attaches a copy of the receipt to his expense report. Alterations are usually less 
noticeable on a photocopy than on an original document. For precisely this reason, 
businesses should require original receipts and ink signatures on expense reports. 
 
As with other expense frauds, overstated expense reimbursement schemes often succeed 
because of poor controls. In companies where supporting documents are not required, for 
example, fraudsters simply lie about how much they paid for a business expense. With no 
support available, it may be very difficult to disprove an employee’s false expense claims.
