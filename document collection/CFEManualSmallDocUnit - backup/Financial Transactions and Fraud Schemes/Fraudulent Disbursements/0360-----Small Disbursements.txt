Small Disbursements 
Another way for employees to avoid detection in a refund scheme is to keep the sizes of the 
disbursements low. Many companies set limits below which management review of a refund 
is not required. Where this is the case, employees simply process copious numbers of 
refunds that are small enough that they do not have to be reviewed.  
 
EXAMPLE 
An employee created over 1,000 false refunds, all under the review limit of $15. He was 
eventually caught because he began processing refunds before store hours and another 
employee noticed that refunds were appearing on the system before the store opened. 
Nevertheless, before his scheme was detected the man made off with over $11,000 of his 
employer’s money.
