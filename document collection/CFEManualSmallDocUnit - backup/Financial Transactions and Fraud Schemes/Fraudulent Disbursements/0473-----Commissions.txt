Commissions 
Commission schemes can often be detected with the following techniques: 
• Compare commission expenses to sales figures to verify linear correlation. 
• Prepare a comparative analysis of commission earned by salesperson, verifying rates and 
calculation accuracy. Inordinately high earnings by an individual could signal fraud. 
• Analyze sales by salesperson for uncollected sales amounts. 
• Determine proper segregation of duties in calculation of commission amounts. 
Commissions should be independently provided by personnel outside the sales 
department. 
• Contact a random sample of customers to confirm sales.
