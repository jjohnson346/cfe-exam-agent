Holograms  
Holograms have been used by issuers as security devices since the early 1980s. Not long after 
implementation of this feature, however, it was found that a very accurate counterfeiting 
industry was emerging in Asia. If one assesses the average credit limit of fraudulent cards at a 
conservative $2,000, it takes few in circulation to  add up to considerable losses to the issuer.
