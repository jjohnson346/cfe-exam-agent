Advanced Authorization 
Visa recently unveiled technology for analyzing card transactions both individually and 
collectively across its network in order to detect emerging fraud patterns. When a credit card 
is swiped, Advanced Authorization provides an instantaneous rating of the transaction’s 
potential for fraud to the card-issuing financial institution, including whether the card 
number was among those lost or stolen in a data-security incident. The system is designed to 
spot situations where multiple accounts are associated with fraudulent testing or some other 
type of coordinated attack involving multiple accounts.
