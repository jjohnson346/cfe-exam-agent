Types of Fraud 
There are several ways in which fraud may be perpetrated through EBPP and P2P systems 
since passwords that allow access into customer bank accounts must be made available to 
third parties. Also, bills that contain significant information about customers must be passed 
through multiple parties. Potential sources of fraud include the following: 
• A biller may send a bill for services not rendered or for goods never sent. 
• A person who has obtained information about another person’s bank account may  
instruct a biller to obtain payment from the other person’s account. 
• A hacker could obtain passwords and usernames from an aggregator and use that  
information to direct transfers from a consumer’s bank account. 
• An employee at the site providing EBPP services that has been provided a consumer’s 
usernames and passwords for screen scraping purposes could use that information to 
direct transfers from the consumer’s bank account. 
• A bank employee may use customer information to direct transfers from a  
customer’s account.

Unfortunately, the financial institution that offers electronic fund transfers to its customers 
will have difficulty determining the source of any leak of customer information necessary to 
initiate a transfer. Therefore, in order to maintain good relations with its customer and to 
avoid further liability, a bank may accept responsibility for them. Thus, the best strategy for 
the bank will be to take measures that reduce the probability that fraud will materialize in the 
first place.
