Check and Credit Card Fraud


:


Stop Payment Orders 
This scheme is quite simple. A “customer” purc hases an expensive item with a check, and 
then notifies his bank to stop payment. Savvy check passers may even contact the merchant, 
saying the item was defective, and that they should expect to hear from the customer’s 
attorney. Meanwhile, the check passer sells the item for a tidy profit.  
 
Another scenario is that, after purchasing the item and notifying the bank to stop payment, 
the fraudster goes back to the store, wishing to return the item and receive a full refund. The 
merchant refunds the amount in cash and the scheme is successful.
