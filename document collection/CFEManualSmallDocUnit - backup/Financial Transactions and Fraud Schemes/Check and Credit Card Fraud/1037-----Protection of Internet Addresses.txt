false domain names to attract the bank’s customers and get them to provide information that 
will then be used for illicit purposes. This activity, known as cybercloning, involves the creation 
of a “spoof” site, complete with a domain name close to the domain name of a legitimate 
bank and containing the real bank’s logo. An e-mail may be sent asking customers and 
potential customers to log on to the false domain name. Those who respond may be asked 
for information such as account numbers and credit card numbers. Alternately, individuals 
may register domain names close to the domain name of actual banks and use those sites to 
market goods or services with which the bank would not want to be associated. For instance, 
Citigroup had a battle with an individual who registered the name citicard.com and directed 
users who logged in to this site to an online gambling site.
