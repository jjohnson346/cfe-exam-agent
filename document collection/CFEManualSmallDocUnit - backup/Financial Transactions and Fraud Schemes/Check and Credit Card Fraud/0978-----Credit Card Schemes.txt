Credit Card Schemes 
There are many different types of credit card schemes including selling the cards to thieves, 
family members using the credit cards without authorization, and fraudulently obtaining a 
card. Statutes relating to the misuse of credit cards generally prohibit the obtaining of 
property or services through the use of a credit card if the use of the card is for any reason 
unauthorized. The federal statute prohibiting the use of fraudulent credit cards is found at 15 
U.S.C. § 1664. This statute prohibits using a fraudulently obtained credit card to obtain 
anything of value aggregating $1,000 or more, and it prohibits receiving anything of value 
purchased with an illegal credit card. A violator may be fined up to $10,000 and/or 
imprisoned for up to 10 years.
