:


Unauthorized Use of a Lost or Stolen Card 
Fraudulent activity normally occurs within hours of the loss or theft, before most victims 
have called to report the loss. Increasingly, victims aren’t even aware that their credit cards 
are being fraudulently used until they receive their monthly statement. It is extremely 
important that victims report the loss or theft of their card within 60 days of receiving the 
statement with the fraudulent charges, as they will not be held responsible for any charges 
(beyond $50) that occur during that time frame.  If the credit card company is not notified of 
the theft and the card is used, the customer will be liable.
