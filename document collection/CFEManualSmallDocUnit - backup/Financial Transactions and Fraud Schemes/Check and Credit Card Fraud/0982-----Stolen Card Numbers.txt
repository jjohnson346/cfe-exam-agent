Stolen Card Numbers 
The Internet has become a breeding ground for individuals to obtain stolen credit card 
information. The thieves who steal this information find credit cards or lists of credit card 
holders and the corresponding numbers to their accounts. They then make the numbers 
available to a larger group, which uses the information to obtain goods and services in the 
name of the cardholder. Wrongfully obtained information may be posted on websites that 
originate in foreign countries. The international nature of the fraud makes it arduous to deter 
or punish. One report involved a Romanian website that displayed stolen credit card 
numbers of more than 450 individuals, most from the United States. The list contained 
identifying information of cardholders and was available for several weeks before being shut 
down.
