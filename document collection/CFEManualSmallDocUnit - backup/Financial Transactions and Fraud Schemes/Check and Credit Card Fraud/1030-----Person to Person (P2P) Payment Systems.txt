Person to Person (P2P) Payment Systems 
Personal online payment systems, often called P2P or person-to-person payment systems, 
have become popular ways for making relatively small payments between individuals or 
between an individual and a business. These payments have become popular in the online 
auction market, where winning bids may be too small to justify the use of a credit card or the 
seller is an individual who does not accept credit card payments. In 2002, eBay, the online 
auction site, acquired PayPal, the dominant provider of P2P services. PayPal currently has 
more than 164 million accounts worldwide, and is available in 190 markets and 17 different 
currencies. The success of proprietary systems like PayPal has induced conventional banks to 
consider entering the P2P arena. Many banks have begun to offer similar services. 
 
One restriction of most current P2P systems is that they will only complete transfers to 
persons who are also subscribers to the service. While this restriction may help a system to 
gain a customer base and reduce fraud by obtaining information about recipients, it also 
limits the scope of potential users.
