• Large periodic balances in individual  accounts with no apparent business. 
• Low average balance compared to high level of deposits. 
• Many checks made payable to other banks. 
• Bank willingness to pay against uncollected funds. 
• Deposits not made daily or intact. 
• Entity uses receipts that do not indicate mode of payment. 
• One or more personal checks in the cash drawer by the fund custodian.

• Irregular check endorsements. 
• Amount of deposit does not agree with daily activity report.

Financial Transactions  Check and Credit Card Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1011 
• Check numbers, payee name, date, and amount don’t agree with entries in the  
check register. 
• Voided checks are not retained. 
• Checks are issued to individuals for large, even dollar amounts. 
• Supporting documentation for checks is not available or has been prematurely destroyed. 
• Cash withdrawal with deposit checks drawn on another bank. 
 
There are several tips for businesses to use when cashing business and payroll checks: 
• Examine all checks. Insist that the check be signed in front of the clerk. Compare the 
signature written on the check with the signature on the driver’s license or state 
identification. 
• Be particularly careful with large-dollar checks presented by noncustomers.  
• Examine all checks for signs of counterfeiting, such as a glossy, “crayonish” appearance 
and any lack of detail and sharpness. 
• Look for signs of alterations or erasures, es pecially in the signature or numerical and 
written amounts.  
• Compare the bank identification and routing numbers for a match. 
• The texture of the check should appear smooth; a rough document might signal 
erasures. 
• Be cautious of information that is typed or stamped. 
• All checks, except government issue, should have at least one perforated edge. 
• The magnetic ink used for routing codes should appear nonreflective and dull. 
• Look for faded colored paper, which can indicate that the check has been chemically 
bleached. 
• A color copy might reflect odd colors at times due to a failure of the toner to mix 
satisfactorily. 
• Black lettering might have a slightly greenish cast when examined under a magnifying 
glass. 
• A light colored or delicate background might fade out when copied. 
• Absence of any design in background of check paper. 
• Absence of bank logo and the printing of the bank name in regular lettering. 
• Absence of the address of the bank on the check. 
• Overall appearance of poor quality of printing and paper. 
• A payroll check will usually be for an odd amount and will appear neat, clean, and  
usually unfolded.
