Counterfeiting Checks 
An effective check counterfeiting operation can turn a simple $5,000 investment into a 
$1,000,000 windfall within a 30-day timeframe. This can be done without high levels of 
computer expertise or programming. Simple check printing software can be purchased in 
almost any office supply store along with blank paper stock and magnetic ink cartridges. The 
overall initial investment consists of a quality computer, color inkjet printer, check format 
and MICR font software, magnetic ink cartridges, and paper stock. After making the initial 
investment, the printers only have to concern themselves with purchasing additional ink  
and paper.
