(1)  knowingly purc hases, directly or indirectly, any property of the estate of which the person is such 
an officer in a case under Title 11;  
 
(2)  knowingly refuses to permit a reasonable opportunity for the inspection by parties in interest of 
the documents and accounts relating to the affairs of estates in the person’s charge by parties 
when directed by the court to do so; or  
(3)  knowingly refuses to permit a reasonable opport unity for the inspection by the United States 
Trustee of the documents and accounts relating to the affairs of any estate in the person’s  
charge.

violation of this statute is only a misdemeanor, whereas all of the above are felonies. 
Conviction under this Section carries a fine, as well as forfeiture of the person’s office.
