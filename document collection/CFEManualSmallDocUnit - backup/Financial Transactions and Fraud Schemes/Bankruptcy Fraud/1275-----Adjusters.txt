Adjusters 
Adjusters, or operations agents as they are frequently called, are the “right hand” to trustees 
and debtors. An adjuster or operations agent is an individual who handles the peripheral 
duties of a trustee. Such duties include securing the business location, changing locks, 
locating assets of the estate, locating business records, opening new bank accounts, 
investigating thefts of assets in conjunction with the trustee, storing assets of the estate, and 
arranging sales of assets. Adjusters also can assist debtors and trustees in operating the 
debtor’s business and in helping to prepare bankruptcy schedules, as well as interim 
statements and operating reports.
