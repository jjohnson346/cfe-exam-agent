Debtors 
A debtor is defined in Title 11, U.S.C., section 101(13) as a “person” or “municipality” who is 
the subject of a filing under Title 11. “Person” is  defined as an individual, partnership, or 
corporation. “Municipality” is defined as a political subdivision, public agency, or 
instrumentality of a state. An individual debtor’s objective in a Chapter 7 case is to be 
relieved of all dischargeable debts and to obtain a fresh start. This is accomplished by the 
court granting the individual debtor a discharge. The debtor’s primary objective in a Chapter 
11 should be to have a plan of reorganization confirmed by the court and preserve the 
business operations.
