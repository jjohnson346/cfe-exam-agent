Bankruptcy-Related Violations  
Although bankruptcy crimes are the focus of this section, there are other crimes that are 
usually perpetrated prior to the filing of a bankruptcy petition. In some cases, the bankruptcy 
process is the culmination of a pattern of prior criminal activity. There are many other crimes 
frequently associated with bankruptcy including mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, interstate 
transportation of stolen goods or property, aiding or abetting, false statements, conspiracy, tax 
evasion, and money laundering. Bankruptcy fraud is also a predicate offense under RICO. For 
more information on these offenses, see the “Law Related to Fraud” chapter in the Law 
section of the Fraud Examiners Manual. 
 
Although the criminal aspects of bankruptcy crimes are heard in District Court, the 
underlying facts dealing with a debtor’s misc onduct also are heard in the form of civil 
proceedings before the United States Bankruptcy Court. Parallel proceedings occur in cases 
where bankruptcy fraud allegations have been made. Several examples of civil proceedings

of trustees and examiners, lawsuits for recovery of fraudulently transferred property, and 
objections to the debtor’s discharge.
