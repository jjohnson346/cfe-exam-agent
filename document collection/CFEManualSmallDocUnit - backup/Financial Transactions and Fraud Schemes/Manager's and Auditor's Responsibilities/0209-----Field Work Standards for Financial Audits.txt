Field Work Standards for Financial Audits 
GAGAS field work standards for financial audits include the three generally accepted 
standards of fieldwork established by the AICPA, as well as five additional fieldwork 
standards.  
 
The three AICPA standards of fieldwork are as follows: 
• The auditor must adequately plan the work and must properly supervise any assistants. 
• The auditor must obtain a sufficient understanding of the entity and its environment, 
including its internal control to assess the risk of material misstatement of the financial 
statements whether due to error or fraud, and to design the nature, timing, and extent of 
further audit procedures. 
• The auditor must obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence by performing procedures 
to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion regarding financial statements under audit. 
 
The five additional fieldwork standards prescribed by GAGAS state that: 
• Auditors should communicate with the audited entity their understanding of the services 
to be performed for each engagement and document that understanding through a 
written communication. In their communications, auditors should specifically address 
their planned work and the level of assurance to be provided related to testing internal 
control over financial reporting and compliance with laws, regulations, and provisions of 
contracts or grant agreements. Auditors should also communicate any potential 
restrictions on the auditors’ reports in order to reduce the risk that the needs or 
expectations of the parties involved may be misinterpreted. 
• Auditors should evaluate whether the audited entity has taken appropriate corrective 
action to address findings and recommendations from previous engagements that could 
have a material effect on the financial statements. 
• Auditors should design the audit to provide reasonable assurance of detecting material 
misstatements resulting from violations of contract provisions or grant agreements that 
have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. If 
during the course of the audit, auditors become aware of indications of abuse that could 
have a material, indirect effect on the financial statements, auditors should apply audit 
procedures specifically directed to ascertain whether material abuse has occurred and the 
potential effect on the financial statements or other financial data significant to the audit

objectives. However, because the determination of abuse is subjective, auditors are not 
required to provide reasonable assurance of detecting abuse. 
• When auditors identify problems such as internal control deficiencies, fraud, illegal acts, 
violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or abuse, they should plan 
audit procedures to develop an explanation of the criteria, condition, cause, and effect or 
potential effect of the problem to facilitate the achievement of the audit objectives.  
• Audit documentation should contain sufficient information to provide a clear 
understanding of the work performed, the audit evidence obtained and its source, and 
the conclusions reached. The audit documentation should enable an experienced auditor, 
having no previous connection with the audit, to understand from the documentation 
the nature, timing, extent, and results of the audit procedures performed, the conclusions 
reached on significant matters, and that the accounting records reconcile to the financial 
statements. The documentation should be completed prior to the issuance of the 
auditors’ report, and should also include evidence of supervisory review of the work 
performed, as well as any departures from GAGAS.
