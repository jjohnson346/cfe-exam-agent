RESPONSES INVOLVING THE NATURE, TIMING, AND EXTENT OF PROCEDURES TO BE PERFORMED TO ADDRESS THE IDENTIFIED RISKS 
This section notes that the auditing procedures performed in response to identified risks will 
vary depending on the type of risks identified. Such procedures may involve both 
substantive tests and tests of the operating effectiveness of the entity’s internal controls. 
However, because management may have the ability to override controls that may otherwise 
appear to be operating effectively, it is unlikely that the audit risk can be reduced 
appropriately by performing only tests of controls. 
  
Therefore, the auditor’s response to specifically identified risks of fraud should include the 
following: 
• Changing the nature  of the auditing procedures to obtain more reliable or additional 
corroborative information by, for example, consulting independent sources or 
conducting physical inspections; 
• Changing the timing  of substantive tests by, for example, conducting substantive tests at 
or near the end of a reporting period; and 
• Ensuring the extent  of the procedures reflects the assessment of the risk of fraud by, for 
example, increasing sample sizes or performing analytical procedures at a more detailed 
level.
