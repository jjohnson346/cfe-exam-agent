TESTING CONTROLS 
The auditor should test both the design and operating effectiveness of the company’s 
ICOFR. In testing the design effectiveness of the controls, the auditor should determine 
whether the controls, if operated as prescribed, satisfy the company’s control objectives and 
can effectively prevent or detect errors or fraud that could result in material misstatements. 
This testing may include inquiry of staff members, observation of operations, and 
examination of relevant documentation. 
 
In testing the operating effectiveness of the controls, the auditor should determine whether 
the control is operating as designed, as well as whether the person operating the control has 
the appropriate authority and competence to perform the control effectively. An auditor may 
test the operations of the controls through inquiry of staff members, observation of 
operations, examination of relevant documentation, and re-performance of the control.
