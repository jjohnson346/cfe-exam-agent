Auditors 
The Yellow Book stresses the importance of the auditors’ ethical responsibilities while 
conducting government audits, emphasizing that the public expects auditors in the 
government sector to conduct their professional work in accordance with ethical principles. 
To underscore this responsibility, GAGAS lay out five specific, overarching ethical 
principles that must guide the work of all auditors performing government audit 
engagements.
