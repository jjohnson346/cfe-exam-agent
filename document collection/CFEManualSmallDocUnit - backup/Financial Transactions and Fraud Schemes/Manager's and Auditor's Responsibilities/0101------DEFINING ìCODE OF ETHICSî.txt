DEFINING “CODE OF ETHICS” 
The rules define a “code of ethics” as a set of written standards that are designed to deter 
wrongdoing and to promote: 
• Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical treatment of actual or apparent 
conflicts of interest between personal and professional interests; 
• Full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in all documents filed with the 
SEC and all other public communications; 
• Compliance with all applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations; 
• The prompt reporting to the appropriate person or persons within the company of 
violations of the code; and 
• Accountability for adherence to the code. 
 
The SEC believes that the establishment of provisions beyond this definitional outline is 
best left to the discretion of the company. Therefore, the rules do not specify any detailed 
requirements, particular language, compliance procedures, or sanctions for violations that 
must be included in the code of ethics. The SEC does, however, explicitly encourage the 
adoption of codes that are broader and more comprehensive than necessary to meet the 
disclosure requirements.
