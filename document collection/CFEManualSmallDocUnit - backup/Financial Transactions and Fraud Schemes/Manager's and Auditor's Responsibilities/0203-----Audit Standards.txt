Audit Standards 
The Yellow Book sets out three types of government audit standards: general standards, field 
work standards, and reporting standards. The general standards apply to both financial and 
performance audits. However, GAGAS provide a separate set of field work and reporting 
standards for each type of government audit. Additionally, the Yellow Book provides a 
separate set of standards — general, field work, and reporting — for attestation engagements. 
The discussion below contains a brief overview of the Yellow Book standards for audit 
engagements.
