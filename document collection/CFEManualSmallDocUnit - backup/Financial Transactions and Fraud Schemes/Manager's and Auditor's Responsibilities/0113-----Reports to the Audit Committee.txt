Reports to the Audit Committee 
Auditors must report directly to the audit committee—not management—and must make 
timely reports on the following: 
• All critical accounting policies and practices used; 
• Alternative GAAP methods that were discussed with management, the ramifications of 
the use of those alternative treatments, and the treatment preferred by the auditors; and 
• Any other material written communications between the auditors and management, such 
as any management letter or the schedule of unadjusted audit differences.
