CONSIDERING FRAUD RISK FACTORS 
As discussed above, even though fraud is concealed, the auditor may identify events or 
conditions that indicate incentives or pressures to commit fraud, opportunities to carry out 
fraud, or attitudes and rationalizations to justify fraudulent conduct. These events and 
conditions are referred to as “fraud risk factors.” The auditor should consider whether one 
or more fraud risk factors are present and should be considered in identifying and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement due to fraud. However, the auditor should be careful not 
to create a laundry list of factors that are only given cursory consideration. The Appendix to 
AU section 316 contains a list of examples of fraud risk factors.
