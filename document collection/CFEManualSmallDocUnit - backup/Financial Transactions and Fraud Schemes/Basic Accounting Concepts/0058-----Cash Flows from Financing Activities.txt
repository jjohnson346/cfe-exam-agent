Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
Cash flows from financing activities involve the cash received or paid in connection with 
issuing debt and equity securities. Cash inflows in this category occur when a company sells 
its own stock, issues bonds, or takes out a loan. A company’s cash outflows from financing 
activities include paying cash dividends to shareholders, acquiring shares of its own stock 
(called treasury stock), and repaying debt.  
  
The total cash flows from all three categories are combined to arrive at the net increase or 
decrease in cash for the year. This total is then added to or subtracted from the cash balance 
at the beginning of the year to arrive at the cash balance at the end of the year, which ties 
back to the amount of cash reported on the balance sheet.
