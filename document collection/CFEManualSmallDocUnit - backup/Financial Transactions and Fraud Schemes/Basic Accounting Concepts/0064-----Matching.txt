Matching 
The matching principle requires that expenses be recorded in the same accounting period as 
the revenues they help generate. Estimates, accruals, and allocations are often needed to 
meet this requirement. When a sale is recorded, the appropriate charges for cost of goods 
sold, or other expenses directly corresponding to the sale, should be recorded in the same 
accounting period.
