Periodicity—Time Period Assumption 
The life of an entity is divided into economic time periods on which reporting statements are 
fashioned. These reporting periods vary, but a year is the most common. Some companies 
follow the calendar year, while others use a business year that ends near the lowest point of 
business activity in a 12-month cycle, regardless of where that point falls in the calendar year.
