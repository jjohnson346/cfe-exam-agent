Objectivity 
Accounting records should be designed and kept on objective, rather than subjective, 
evidence. Underlying verifiability must exist for the information contained in the statements. 
For example, assets are carried at historical cost and not at an estimated current value. 
Historical cost should be verifiable through legitimate proof of purchase.
