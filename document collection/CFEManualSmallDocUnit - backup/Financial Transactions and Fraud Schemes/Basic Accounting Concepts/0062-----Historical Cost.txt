Historical Cost 
Although some exceptions exist, historical cost is, generally, the proper basis for the 
recording of assets, expenses, equities, etc. For example, a piece of operational machinery 
should be shown on the balance sheet at initial acquisition cost and not at current market 
value or an estimated replacement value.
