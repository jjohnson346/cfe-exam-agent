Unauthorized Trading 
Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, only the customer named on the trading account can 
authorize trades. Any losses accruing to the customer account because of an unauthorized 
trade, whether made by mistake or intentionally, are the responsibility of the brokerage firm 
and must be reimbursed to the customer. Gains from unauthorized trades also belong to the 
customer. This prevents brokers from executing unauthorized trades, claiming error, and 
taking any profits that may occur. The only entries to the brokerage company error account 
should be losses; profits in an error account should be investigated. Customers must report 
unauthorized trades to the management of the brokerage firm as soon as detected. Silence 
would imply ratification of the transaction.
