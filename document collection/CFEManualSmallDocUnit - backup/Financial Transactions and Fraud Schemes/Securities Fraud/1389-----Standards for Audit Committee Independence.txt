AUDIT COMMITTEE RESPONSIBILITIES  
Section 301 of the Act requires that the audit committee for each publicly traded company 
shall be directly responsible for appointing, compensating, and overseeing the work of the 
Financial Transactions  Securities Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1507 
company’s outside auditors. The Act also mandates that the auditors must report directly to 
the audit committee ? not management ? and makes it the responsibility of the audit 
committee to resolve disputes between management and the auditors. Section 301 also 
requires that the audit committee must have the authority and funding to hire independent 
counsel and any other advisors it deems necessary to carry out its duties.  
 
COMPOSITION OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandates that each member of a company’s audit committee must 
be a member of its board of directors, and must otherwise be “independent.” The term 
“independent” means that the audit committee member can only receive compensation from 
the company for his service on the board of directors, the audit committee, or another 
committee of the board of directors. They cannot be paid by the company for any other 
consulting or advisory work.  
 
FINANCIAL EXPERT  
Section 407 of the Act requires every public company to disclose in its periodic reports to 
the SEC whether or not the audit committee has at least one member who is a “financial 
expert,” and if not to explain the reasons why. The Act defines a “financial expert” as a 
person who, through education and experience as a public accountant or auditor, or a CFO, 
comptroller, chief financial officer or a similar position (1) has an understanding of generally 
accepted accounting principles and financial statements; (2) has experience in preparing or 
auditing financial statements of comparable companies and the application of such principles 
in accounting for estimates, accruals, and reserves; (3) has experience with internal controls; 
and (4) has an understanding of audit committee functions.  
 
ESTABLISHING A WHISTLEBLOWING STRUCTURE 
The Act makes it the responsibility of the audit committee to establish procedures (e.g., a 
hotline) for receiving and dealing with complaints and anonymous employee tips regarding 
irregularities in the company’s accounting met hods, internal controls, or auditing matters.
