INSIDER TRADING RULES 
Rule 10b-5, promulgated under section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
prohibits any false statements or other fraudulent activity in connection with the purchase or 
sale of any security, including insider trading. It provides the main basis for the SEC to 
investigate possible security fraud claims. Rule 10b-5 contains civil and administrative 
remedies (such as the power to initiate actions to enjoin further violations) enforced by the 
SEC as well as criminal sanctions enforced by the Department of Justice. Specifically, rule 
10b-5 makes it unlawful for anybody to directly or indirectly conduct operations of business 
that would deceive another person concerning transactions involving securities. Although 
the text of the Securities Exchange Act does not provide for a private cause of action for 
rule 10b-5 violations, the Supreme Court found an implied right, which typically requires the 
plaintiff to prove (1) a material misstatement or omission; (2) intentional fraud or deceit by 
the party charged with the violation; (3) relia nce on the misrepresentation or omission in the 
Financial Transactions  Securities Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1541 
purchase or sale of a security; and (4) econom ic loss caused by the purchase or sale of  
the security.  
 
However, 10b-5 claims do have certain limitations. For example, there is no private cause of 
action against those who merely aided and abetted the primary violators, and in Stoneridge 
Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., the Court held that there is no private cause 
of action against third parties who neither make alleged misstatements nor engage in 
deceptive conduct on which investors relied. 
 
In Stoneridge, a group of investors in Charter Communications, Inc. accused two Charter 
suppliers of entering in a business scheme with Charter, which allowed Charter to issue 
fraudulent financial statements. In the alleged scheme, Charter gave its equipment vendor 
above-normal payments for T.V. set-top boxes and the supplier then gave back the extra 
payments as advertising fees. Charter then fraudulently accounted the returned payments as 
revenue. The Court ruled that the Rule 10b-5 does not extend to third parties (aiders or 
abettors) who do not make alleged misstatements and do not engage in deceptive conduct 
on which investors relied. There was no basis for finding that the group of investors did not 
rely on anything the suppliers said or did. The investors could not have relied upon the 
suppliers’ deceptive acts for two reasons: (1) Charter’s suppliers did not take part in 
preparing or distributing the fraudulent statements; and (2) the suppliers did not make any 
misstatements relied upon by the public or violate any duty to disclose. As a result, the Court 
held that the group of investors could not show reliance on any of the suppliers’ actions.  
 
The interesting thing about the Stoneridge decision is that it cannot be broadly read to say that 
secondary actors (lawyers, accountants, and bankers) are free from liability under Rule 10b-5. 
The Court held that deceptive conduct can provide the basis for securities fraud liability if 
plaintiffs can establish that they relied on that conduct. Unlike the relationship between the 
investors and suppliers in Stoneridge, lawyers and accountants often serve as advisers, which 
could be considered as taking part in activities that investors could rely upon.  
 
The SEC also recently issued Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b5-2 to supplement section 10(b) of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b5-2 deal with 
unsettled issues that have arisen under Rule 10b-5.

Rule 10b5-1 addresses the issue of when insider trading liability arises in connection with a 
trader’s “use” or “knowing possession” of mater ial non-public information. Specifically, rule 
10b5-1 prohibits the purchase or sale of a security “on the basis of” material, non-public 
information. However, the Rule also sets forth an affirmative defense for traders if they can 
show that such trades were made pursuant to a preexisting, written 10b5-1 trading plan.  
 
Recently, the SEC indicated that it intends to scrutinize plans contemplated by Rule 10b5-1 
more critically. This increased scrutiny likely resulted from the publication of a 2006 study by 
Alan Jagolizer, an assistant professor at the Stanford University Graduate School of 
Business, which suggested that on average, sales under Rule 10b5-1 plans were generating 
“abnormal trade returns” and that such plans seemed to outperform the market.  
 
Rule 10b5-2 addresses the issue of when a breach of a family or other non-business 
relationship may give rise to liability under the misappropriation theory of insider trading. 
Under the misappropriation theory, as defined by the Supreme Court case in United States v. 
O’Hagan, 521 U.S. 642 (1997), a person is liable for securities fraud if he: 
• Misappropriates confidential information, 
• For the purpose of securities trading, 
• In breach of a duty owed to the sources, and 
• Trades based on the misappropriated information. 
 
Rule 10b5-2 seeks to provide further guidance regarding what types of relationships create a 
“duty” not to use the information received. For example, if a person agrees to keep the 
information in confidence, a duty of trust or confidence will exist. Similarly, if two persons 
have a “history, pattern, or practice of sharing confidences,” such that the recipient 
reasonably should know that the other expects that the inside information will remain 
confidential, a duty of trust or confidence will exist. 
 
Subsection (b)(3) also creates a presumption that any person who receives inside information 
from his spouse, parent, child, or sibling will owe that other person a duty of trust or 
confidence.
