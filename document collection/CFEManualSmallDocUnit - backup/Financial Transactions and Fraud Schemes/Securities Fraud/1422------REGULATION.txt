REGULATION  
Is there some other regulatory system that significantly reduces the risk of the transaction 
thereby rendering the application of the securities laws unnecessary? If the transaction is 
deemed appropriately regulated in ways other than through the application of the securities 
laws, then it is less likely that securities laws will be brought to bear.
