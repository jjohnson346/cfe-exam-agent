Bucket Shops 
Bucket shops are fraudulent enterprises that masquerade as licensed brokerage operations. A 
true retail futures brokerage would be required to be registered and meet certain financial 
thresholds. Salespeople would be required to pass the Series Three National Commodity 
Futures Examination and all other personnel would need to be registered as Associated 
Persons. There may also be other registration or licensing requirements depending on the 
type of business that the brokerage engages in. (See 
www.nfa.futures.org/registration/who_has_to_r egister.asp). Bucket shops bypass all these 
requirements and operate like legitimate businesses. 
 
The solution to finding whether or not an individual or firm is legitimate is easy. Go to: 
www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet for commodity futures brokers and firms 
www.finra.org/Investors/ToolsCalculators/BrokerCheck/index.htm for stock, options and 
futures brokers and firms 
www.sec.gov/investor/brokers.htm for securities brokers and firms
