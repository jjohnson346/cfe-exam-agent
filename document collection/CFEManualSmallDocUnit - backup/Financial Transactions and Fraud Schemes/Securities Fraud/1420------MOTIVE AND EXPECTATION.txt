MOTIVE AND EXPECTATION  
What is the issuer’s primary motive? If it is to raise money for the general use of a business 
enterprise then a security may be held to exist. What is the buyer’s primary motive? Is it 
really a loan or an investment-type transaction? What is a reasonable investor thinking? What 
are his expectations?
