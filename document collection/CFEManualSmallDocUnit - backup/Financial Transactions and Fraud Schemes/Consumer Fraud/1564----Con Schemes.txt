Con Schemes 
Confidence games involve a range of fraudulent conduct usually committed by professional 
“con artists” against unsuspecting victims. The victims can be organizations but more 
commonly are individuals. Con men usually act alone but they may group together for a 
particular complex endeavor.  
 
These are some of the many kinds of confidence schemes. Telemarketing schemes and 
pyramid schemes are discussed in more detail at the end of the chapter.
