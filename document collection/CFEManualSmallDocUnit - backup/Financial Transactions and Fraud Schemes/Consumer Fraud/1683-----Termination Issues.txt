Termination Issues 
The end of a franchise relationship also may provide grounds for litigation: 
• Renewal.  Does a franchiser have a duty to renew a franchisee beyond the initial term of 
his license agreement?

• Early termination. Under what circumstances may a franchiser terminate a franchise before 
the expiration of his contractual term? 
• Sale of a franchise. Under what circumstances may a franchiser veto a franchisee’s 
proposed sale of his franchise to a third-party? 
• Post-termination restrictions on competition.  To what extent may the franchiser restrict the 
franchisee’s right to compete after termination? Even if a franchisee is allowed to 
compete after the franchise relationship is ended, the franchiser may sometimes validly 
demand that the franchisee leave his business telephone number to the franchiser as it 
departs the system.
