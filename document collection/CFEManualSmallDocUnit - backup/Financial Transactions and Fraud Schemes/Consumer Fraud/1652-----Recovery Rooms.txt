Recovery Rooms 
Recovery room operations target those who have already lost money to a telemarketing 
scam. Posing as a consumer advocacy group or a law firm, telemarketers offer victims a 
chance to recover any funds they may have lost and bring the perpetrators to justice. Once 
the victim agrees, legal, investigative, and other fees will begin to emerge.
