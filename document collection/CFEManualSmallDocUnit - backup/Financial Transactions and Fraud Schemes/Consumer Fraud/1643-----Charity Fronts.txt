Charity Fronts  
An increasing number of groups calling themselves non-profit, charitable concerns are not 
what they appear. Very little or no money goes to the advertised cause. Police and firemen’s 
associations have in some cases lent their names to telemarketing fund drives that only give 
about 35 percent of their collections to the group. Some boiler room operators claim to call 
for these groups—or for drives against a dise ase or underprivileged children—when they are 
in no way affiliated with the charity.  
  
A twist to this scam is the impersonation of handicapped workers by boiler room operators. 
Phone pros call victims, claiming to be handicapped or disabled, and attempt to sell light 
bulbs and other household products. The merchandise is priced at three times its actual 
value. The money is, of course, pocketed by the operators.
