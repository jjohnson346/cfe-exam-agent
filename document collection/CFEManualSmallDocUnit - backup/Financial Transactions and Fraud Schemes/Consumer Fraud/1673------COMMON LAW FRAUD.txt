COMMON LAW FRAUD 
The failure of the FTC to outlaw fraud in franchising specifically beyond the disclosure 
phase does not leave a defrauded franchisee without remedies. Common law fraud is 
applicable. In general, a common law fraud action requires proof of a knowing or recklessly 
false representation or omission of material fact, reliance, and injury.  
 
Additionally, a contract may be voidable for fraud in the inducement, which occurs when one 
party enters into a contract based on the other party’s fraud. For example, if one party 
deliberately misrepresented material facts to the other, the contract will be unenforceable at 
the option of the aggrieved party. But claims of fraud in the inducement (disclosure fraud) 
are often defeated by carefully drafted language in the franchise agreement.
