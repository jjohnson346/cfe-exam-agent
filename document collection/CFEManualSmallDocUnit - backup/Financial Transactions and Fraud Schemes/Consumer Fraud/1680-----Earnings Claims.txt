Earnings Claims 
Assume that a prospective franchisee relies upon earnings claims published by the franchiser as 
a key factor in his decision to buy the franchise, but those earnings claims are materially 
misleading, or even blatantly false. This is a prime example of disclosure fraud in connection 
with the franchiser’s inducement of potential franchisees to buy the franchise.  
 
Disclosure fraud historically has been the primary target of franchiser regulations. The FTC 
reported that from 1989 to 1992, 100 percent of its franchise enforcement cases were based 
on allegations that the franchiser had provided fraudulent or misleading earnings claims. But

surprisingly, the FTC does not require franchisers to disclose earnings. The FTC rule 
provides for the disclosure of earnings claims regarding actual or potential sales. Income, 
costs, or profits of either existing or prospective franchisees is optional. But if a franchiser 
elects to make earnings claims, it must have a “reasonable” basis for those claims. 
 
Absent published earnings claims, the prospective franchisee is vulnerable to non-written, 
boastful earnings claims made by franchise salespeople who make their living selling 
franchises instead of selling the underlying goods or services. Those non-written claims may 
turn out to be false but the franchiser may try to protect itself by including in the written 
franchise agreement a “no reliance” or “integration” clause that states in effect: 
 
Franchisee acknowledges that this Agreement is the entire agreement of the parties, and 
that in entering into this Agreement, he or she is not relying upon any statements or 
representations that may have been made on or before the date of this Agreement, which are 
not expressly made a part of this Agreement.  
 
Clauses similar to this one often have been used to defeat claims of fraud submitted by 
franchisees who were induced to sign a contract based upon the franchiser’s verbal 
representations.
