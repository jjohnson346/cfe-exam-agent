The Profile 
Unlike some fraudsters who steal as the result of a perceived need, most identity thieves 
make a living stealing identities for profit or at the very least, to supplement their incomes 
generously. Although it can be an employee, friend, or relative, generally the fraudster usually 
falls into one or more profiles: 
• Been convicted, served time in prison, wishes to conceal his identity  
• Been convicted, served time in prison and looking for a “safer” way to commit a crime 
and stay out of prison 
• College student looking for an “easy” way to work his way through school 
• Landlord 
• Rental car agents
