Certifications, Diplomas, Licenses Placed On Workplace Walls 
Something as innocent as a diploma, professional certification, or license can be the 
identifying information that a fraudster uses to obtain a false identity. In the case of a 
professional license, some states require that it be displayed in a prominent place. 
Consequently, information such as the name, address, and license number is readily available 
to the thief.
