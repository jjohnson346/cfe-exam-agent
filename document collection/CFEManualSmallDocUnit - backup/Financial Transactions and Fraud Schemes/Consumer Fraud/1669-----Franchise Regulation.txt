Franchise Regulation 
In 1978, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) entered the realm of franchise regulation 
by enacting “Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising And 
Business Opportunity Ventures”—the “FTC Rule” (16 C.F.R. Part 436). As stated by the 
FTC, “the Rule is designed to enable potential franchisees to protect themselves before 
investing by providing them with information essential to an assessment of the potential 
risks and benefits, to meaningful comparisons with other investments, and to further 
investigation of the franchise opportunity.” As this mission statement suggests, the FTC rule 
addresses the disclosures made by franchisers to potential franchisees, as opposed to ongoing 
issues in the relationship  between franchisers and franchisees and other issues that arise in the 
termination  of franchise relationships.  
 
But the 1978 enactment of the FTC rule did not lead to the eradication of fraud claims in 
franchising relationships—among the rule’s deficiencies, it does not create a private civil 
action. Many state legislatures have enacted laws that supplement the FTC Rule. Illinois is a 
good example of a progressive state in franchisee law. The rule, however, preempts any 
inconsistent state disclosure laws.
