Staff Exploitation 
The customers of fraudulent telemarketing operations are not the only victims. Fronters are 
often poorly educated and easily taken advantage of by the career criminals who run the 
operations. Salespeople may face hidden costs in a work agreement, similar to the ones 
involved in the items they push on unsuspecting customers. For example, boiler room 
operators hold back parts of their phone lists and sell them to crew members as “hot leads.” 
Telescam veterans know how to operate a gift sting that bilks both the customer and the 
salesperson. Operators overstate the retail value of the gifts, so the customers get less than 
they paid for; then, by giving agents an inflated wholesale cost, the operators can pay these 
workers less commission, which is figured on the “profit margin” between wholesale  
and retail.  
 
The salespeople in boiler rooms are sometimes as desperate as their victims. Most are 
unemployed, with little education or marketable skills. Telemarketing promises easy work 
and big pay without any experience. Many pe ople who start out as fronters, however, are 
serving an apprenticeship in their criminal careers. They are wooed with cars, cellular 
phones, and other perks. Former workers have reported that supervisors sprinkled lines of 
cocaine along the phone bank table, and threw handfuls of money into the air, promising the 
proceeds to whoever made the next sale. 
 
Naturally, there are no Social Security or payroll taxes deducted from paychecks, so 
employees can owe big tax bills at the end of the year. Fronters’ commission payments are 
often shorted, or withheld. Paychecks frequently fail to clear the bank. Owners promise big 
profit shares for a month or two, then shut down the business. They tell the workers that 
their assets have been frozen by creditors or regulators. Workers lose their jobs and usually 
their last weeks’ commissions. For the last few months, however, the owners have been 
taking in $25,000 to $30,000 a week.
