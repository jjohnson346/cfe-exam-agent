Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which protects customers’ financial information held by 
banks working in personal finance, creates privacy obligations for financial institutions. 
Specifically, financial institutions have privacy obligations under the Act’s Financial Privacy 
Rule and Safeguards Rule. The Financial Privacy Rule requires financial institutions to 
provide their customers with privacy notices explaining the institution’s policies for 
collecting and sharing personal financial information. Conversely, the Safeguards Rule 
requires all financial institutions to design, implement, and maintain safeguards to protect the 
confidentiality and integrity of customers’ personal information. 
 
Additionally, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act includes a provision that prohibits “pretexting.” 
This statute makes it illegal for anyone to obtain customer information from financial 
institutions by impersonating someone else or making false, fictitious, or fraudulent 
statements. It also prohibits soliciting someone else to engage in pretexting. Violations of 
this provision can result in a fine, imprisonment of up to 5 years, or both.  
 
More information about other provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act can be found in 
the “Sources of Information” chapter in the Investigation Section of the Fraud Examiners  
Manual.
