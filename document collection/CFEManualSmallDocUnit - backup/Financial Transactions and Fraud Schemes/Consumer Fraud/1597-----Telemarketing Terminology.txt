Telemarketing Terminology 
Terms in the scammer’s vocabulary include banging, or  nailing, the customer, in other words, 
closing the deal. A salesperson’s most effective skill is puffing, the ability to sound convincing 
while exaggerating the value of a business opportunity or gift. To make the puffing more 
persuasive, marketers hire singers or criers to tell potential victims what a great deal they are 
getting. Calls from angry customers who realize they have been swindled are known as heat 
calls. These are handled by someone claiming to be the company’s manager or vice-president.
