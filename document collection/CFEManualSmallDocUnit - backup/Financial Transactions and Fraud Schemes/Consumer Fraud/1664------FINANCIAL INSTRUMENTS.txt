FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Financial instruments — such as stocks, borrower’s certificates, currency exchanges, loan 
scams, and investment pools—are perfect tools for the Ponzi artist. Charles Ponzi’s victims 
in 1920 thought they were investing in postal reply coupons that, Ponzi assured everyone, 
yielded whopping profits by playing off the exchange rates of international currency. In our 
own time, as legal tender in Mexico, Brazil, and Asia roller-coasters from one extreme to the 
next, the currency exchange still makes an ideal Ponzi front.  
 
A stock market that gains 25 to 30 percent a year (and individual stocks quadrupling, 
sometimes in a matter of months) encourages the impression that all anyone has to do is put 
down their money and wait by the mailbox. Unscrupulous promoters like to tout new items 
like Internet stocks and biotechnology startups, but any product will do. Even in this wired 
age, commodities futures—from soybeans to pork bellies—are still numbered among the 
most common bait for Ponzi schemes. 
 
Financial instruments are especially effective fronts because most people don’t understand 
how legitimate financial operations take place. When Wall Street is set a-fluttering by 
derivatives of futures contracts, and hedge funds are betting that the market will rise at the 
same time they’re betting it will fall, how is  an average investor with $20,000 supposed to 
understand his options?
