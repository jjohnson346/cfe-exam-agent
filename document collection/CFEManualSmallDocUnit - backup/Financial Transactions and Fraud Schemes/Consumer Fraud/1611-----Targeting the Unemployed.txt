Targeting the Unemployed 
The unemployed are another favorite target for sweepstakes pitches and job search services. 
Whereas “the system” has left the jobless without hope, the telemarketer offers a way 
around official channels. People with bad credit pay telemarketers to “repair” their credit 
record or get a major card. Instead, they get a list of banks that offer credit cards, commonly 
published in newspapers, or an application for a card that requires a security deposit for 
activation, usually several hundred or a thousand dollars. These people are also targeted by 
advance-fee loan scams, which promise loans in exchange for a fee.
