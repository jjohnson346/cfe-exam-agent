Theft of Mail — Incoming or Outgoing 
Theft of mail in either direction provides useful information to the fraudster. Outgoing 
checks left for the mail carrier to pick up provide bank account numbers and other 
information that can be used for illegal purposes. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Using just a driver’s license number and bank account number, a thief was able to 
withdraw more than $30,000 from a security guard’s checking account. In this case, the 
thief used the drive-through at the security guard’s bank to deposit a series of stolen money 
orders and simultaneously make large withdrawals.
