Rental and Loan Applications 
Almost without exception, rental and loan applications yield enough information that can be 
used to establish a false identity. An applicant’s name, Social Security number, previous 
address(es), employment history, telephone numbers, and credit history are required to 
complete the application. Once the thief gets a hold of that information, it is usually quite 
easy to establish an identity.
