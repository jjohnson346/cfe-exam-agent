Franchise Fraud   
Franchising is part of the American Dream. A gateway to business ownership for millions of 
Americans, franchising is estimated to account for more than 40 percent of all retail sales in 
the United States — a percentage that is expected to reach 50 percent in a few short years 
according to a report issued by the House Committee on Small Business. But the dream of 
business ownership can be easily shattered by fraud.
