Automatic Debits 
The personal checking account is one of the most convenient tools for defrauding 
telemarketing customers, thanks to advances in electronic banking technology. Using 
computerized transfers, businesses can set up an automatic debit to the buyer’s account. 
Telemarketing operations use this device to obtain payment before victims can change their 
minds about their purchases. Worse, telemarketers can simply use the information to drain 
the victim’s account. This information is usua lly obtained by telling the victim that the 
account numbers are needed to verify eligibility for a giveaway or business opportunity. 
Banks are not responsible for any losses customers suffer in this way, so there are no 
chargebacks and little recourse for the swindled customer besides filing a complaint. Even if 
an investigation of the complaint brings the scammer to court, the chances that the victim 
will receive restitution are poor.
