Public Records  
Public records yield a wealth of personal data for the identity thief. Real estate records, tax 
liens, licenses, litigation records, and, in some states, drivers license numbers, all reveal 
enough information that can be used to steal a person’s identity or least provide a start for 
the fraudster.
