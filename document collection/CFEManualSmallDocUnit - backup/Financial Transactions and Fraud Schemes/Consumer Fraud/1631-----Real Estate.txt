Real Estate 
Real estate scams are easily recognized. There is almost always an element of time pressure, 
with the victims being convinced they are participating in a “once-in-a-lifetime, now-or-
 never” deal. The investors are led to believe there is no time to investigate the venture, and 
that if they hesitate, they will miss the opportunity to make a fortune. Promises of big profits 
for little or no involvement are the norm in real estate scams. The investor is also misled into 
assuming they are being let in on a special offer or an exclusive deal by the promoter. 
 
Since the 1920s, when thousands of Americans bought swampland in Florida, real estate has 
served as a conduit for fraud. A modern-day variation has dispensed with the actual land 
entirely and simply sells information. Companies tout the riches available in real estate 
through seminars and books that claim to offer secret ways to cash in. The customer pays 
for the secret info and gets worthless tips in return.
