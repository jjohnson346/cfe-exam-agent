Fronters
The fronter calls victims and makes the initial pitch. This low-level worker is usually 
breaking into the business and reads from a script to the prospective customer. Fronters 
seldom see the merchandise or know the full extent of the operation. Keeping fronters in 
the dark, at least in theory, limits what they can tell investigators and protects them in the 
event of prosecution.
