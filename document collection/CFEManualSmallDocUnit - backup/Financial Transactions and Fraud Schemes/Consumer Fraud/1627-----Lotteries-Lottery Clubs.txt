Consumer Fraud

Lotteries/Lottery Clubs 
Consumers receive a false claim that they have won, or can get help to win, a lottery, often in 
a foreign country. Most lottery scams are perpetrated by con artists in other countries, 
sometimes using U.S. addresses to disguise their real locations. Sometimes the lottery 
actually exists, but invitations to play don’t come from governments that operate legitimate 
lotteries or anyone connected to them. The consumer has no way of assuring that they will 
receive the tickets that they pay for or, in the unlikely event that they do win, will ever be 
able to collect their money. Potential victims need to remember that it is illegal to use the 
mail or telephone to play lotteries across borders; U.S. law prohibits it, not only across 
national borders but state lines as well. The consumer could be accused of illegal activities 
just by participating. Differences in legal systems, difficulties of conducting investigations in 
other countries, and expenses and other complications involved in pursuing cross-border 
fraud make the chances of a consumer getting his money back very, very slim.
