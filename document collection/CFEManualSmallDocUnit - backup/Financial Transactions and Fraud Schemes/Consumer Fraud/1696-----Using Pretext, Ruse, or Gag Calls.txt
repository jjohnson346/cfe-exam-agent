Using Pretext, Ruse, or Gag Calls  
Using pretext, ruse, or gag calls claiming to be a person to whom personal information 
would normally be released is common in an identity theft. Since there is no way to verify 
the person on the end of a phone line with photo identification, having only a small amount 
of information can yield the additional data the fraudster seeks. 
 
For example, a number of individuals have reported being called by people claiming to be 
court personnel. The caller states that there is an outstanding warrant for the individual due 
to unpaid tickets or failure to appear for jury duty. When the individual protests his 
innocence, the caller says that it must be a mistake, and asks the individual to provide his 
driver’s license number, Social Security number, and birth date so that the caller can confirm

that a mistake has been made. The caller now has all the information needed to steal the 
individual’s identity.
