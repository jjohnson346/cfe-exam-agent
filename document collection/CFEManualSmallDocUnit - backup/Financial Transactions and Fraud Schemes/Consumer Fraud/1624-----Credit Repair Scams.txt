Credit Repair Scams 
Similar to loan scams are those that promise to repair credit. Pitch men like to say they can 
“wipe away” or “doctor” or “cosmeticize” blotches on credit, insinuating they have ways of 
changing or disguising a person’s credit history. Despite the fact that there is really no way to 
erase bad credit, many people fall for this scam, paying hundreds of dollars to expunge  
their records.
