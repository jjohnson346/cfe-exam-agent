Integrity of Digital Evidence 
Electronic evidence is more volatile than paper information, and because it can be easily 
altered or destroyed, it must be handled properly. For example, computer files can be altered 
simply through the normal startup process. Most  of the Microsoft operating systems, such as 
Windows XP, change the time and date stamps on a number of files during startup and 
delete a number of temporary files during the shutdown process. These pieces of 
information could be critical to the investigation. 
 
The destruction of digital evidence through improper handling can result in a finding of 
spoliation of evidence by a judge or can raise questions about the alteration of exculpatory 
evidence by the defense.  
 
Additionally, if a judge determines that the authenticity of the evidence cannot be 
satisfactorily made, then he may rule that the evidence is inadmissible. Although digital 
evidence is different from tangible evidence, the rules regarding its admissibility in court is 
Investigation  Digital Forensics 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.703 
really no different from the admissibility of any other type of evidence. To be admissible, 
digital evidence must be: 
• Relevant  
• Supported by a foundation for its introduction into court 
• Legally obtained 
• Properly identified 
• Properly preserved 
 
Therefore, should the fraud examiner discover digital evidence, he must be able to state 
unequivocally that the evidence was not changed in any way by his actions. This requires that 
strict forensic methodologies be followed to satisfy the stringent evidentiary standards 
necessary to ensure the integrity of the evidence “beyond a reasonable doubt” for 
presentation in court.
