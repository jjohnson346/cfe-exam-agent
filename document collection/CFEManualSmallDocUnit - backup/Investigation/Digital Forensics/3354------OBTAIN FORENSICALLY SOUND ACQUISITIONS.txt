OBTAIN FORENSICALLY SOUND ACQUISITIONS 
EnCase Forensic produces an exact binary duplicate of the original drive or media, then 
verifies it by generating MD5 hash values for related image files and assigning CRC values to 
the data. These checks and balances reveal when evidence has been tampered with or 
altered, helping to keep all digital evidence forensically sound for use in court proceedings.
