Forensic Experts 
Also, when conducting an examination involving computers, the examiner should determine 
whether an outside forensic examiner is needed or whether the expertise is available in-house. 
Some organizations have their own in-house personnel, whom they have trained and 
outfitted with the proper equipment and software tools to conduct the examination and 
analyze digital evidence while others may prefer the use of an outside examiner who will be 
able to conduct a thorough examination, prepare a proper report, and deliver expert 
testimony if needed in legal proceedings. 
 
Sometimes information retrieval is as easy as obtaining a warrant and searching the hard 
drive of the target computer. But many fraudsters anticipate their exposure and delete 
incriminating files from their machines. In these instances, it is important to know that there 
are a variety of ways of recovering deleted or hidden data from a target computer and its 
peripherals. 
 
A computer-forensic examiner is a trained professional who is capable of analyzing digital 
media at the hexadecimal level. The hexadecimal level means that every sector and all the 
bytes in those sectors are available for viewing. This includes deleted files, both purposefully 
deleted and those that were deleted through various Windows-automated processes. This 
can also include temporary auto-save files, print-spool files, deleted e-mails, and link files. 
The hexadecimal level also contains various items found in restore points and registry files

that define hardware, such as external drives and websites visited, in addition to the 
document revisions and files created and maintained by the user. 
 
The increased sophistication of Windows allows the computer system to store more 
information about how people use their computers. The forensic examiner will be able to 
uncover a large amount of data that relates to the use of a computer, what is or has been 
stored on it, and the details about the user. In Micr osoft’s effort to “be all” to the user, it has 
incorporated ways to make computer use more secure, such as offering encryption and other 
methods to protect data from unwanted access. In the future, these types of innovations will 
stall the examiner and will sometimes successfully prevent system access. However, these 
encryption packages are not always foolproof. The Encrypted File System offered by 
Microsoft has in fact been cracked by a number  of password-cracking software makers. In 
addition to encryption files, other encryption algorithms exist that are easily installed and can 
be used to encrypt the entire hard drive. In situations such as this, it becomes necessary for 
the examiner to be able to identify whether a drive is encrypted before seizing and 
disconnecting the system. 
 
Moreover, computer-forensic examiners have special tools and software designed to 
facilitate a thorough and legally sufficient analysis of items that contain digital evidence. It is 
important to allow a trained examiner to conduct a proper seizure and examination on a 
piece of evidence so the investigator will have the best chance of using that evidence in a 
legal proceeding. Whether an agency or company is defending against an unlawful 
termination suit or filing a criminal complaint, it is vital that the digital evidence is handled 
properly. 
 
Furthermore, whether technical specialists are needed to assist with an investigation will 
depend on the complexity of the examination required. The more technical the nature of the 
crime, the more technical and specialized the analytical skills required. Some computer 
investigations, however, do not require extremely sophisticated technical skills. For example, 
in cases where the computer is the instrument used to commit the crime (e.g., scams 
involving payroll applications, cooking the books, fraudulent electronic funds transfers, 
insider trading, etc.), the fraud examiner need only know how to search a database and 
analyze the results. 
 
Additionally, this determination will depend on the examiners skill levels. Therefore, an 
examiner conducting an examination involving computers must have a basic understanding 
Investigation  Digital Forensics 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.705 
of his skill levels and must be aware of his limitations in the field of computer technology 
because, in many instances, one or more technical specialists are needed to assist with an 
investigation.  
 
Within the computer forensics field, there are several different types of special experts: 
• Operating and file system experts : These experts are proficient in certain operating systems 
(e.g., Windows 7, Unix, Solaris, OS X, or AS400) and the various file systems they 
employ (e.g., Joliet, NTFS, FAT, VFS, Ex t2), and they have the ability to convey 
operational characteristics and observe artifacts. 
• Data recovery experts : These experts operate clean rooms designed to magnetically extract 
information from a damaged media source. Using special tools and equipment, these 
experts can disassemble a hard disk, separate the platters, and extract and reassemble the 
information for subsequent examination. 
• Forensic accounting experts : A forensic accountant can prov ide various services, including 
audits, accountant performance reviews, and examinations of financial documents for 
fraud, misconduct, or industry standard violations. 
• Tape and archival extraction experts : These are experts in extracting information from tape or 
other system backups. Typically, backup solutions archive data in proprietary formats, 
making extraction very cumbersome. 
• Intrusion and malicious code experts : These experts specialize in investigating computer 
network intrusions. Specialists can determine attack vectors, the tools employed, what 
occurred during access, and what, if anything, was taken. 
 
But given the diversity of computer-related fraud, no person can be an expert in all aspects 
of computer technology.
