REMOVABLE STORAGE DEVICES 
In addition to backup tapes, a suspect’s removable storage devices should be examined. 
Removable storage devices such as CDs, DVDs, USB flash drives (also known as thumb 
drives), mp3 players, and various other devices provide users with the ability to store large 
amounts of data. Such devices can be used to facilitate a variety of frauds. They provide 
users with the ability to store files that go undetected by anyone accessing the computer. 
Removable media can also be used to store copies of files containing sensitive information in 
order to facilitate unapproved use.
