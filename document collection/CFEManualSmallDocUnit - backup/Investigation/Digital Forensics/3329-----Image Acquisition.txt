Image Acquisition 
To avoid altering evidence, the examiner should make forensically sound image of the 
suspect system for analysis. Image acquisition involves using a standalone hard drive 
duplicator or similar device to duplicate a computer’s entire drive. This process is known as 
imaging because the hard drive can be imaged to another hard disk drive, a tape, or other 
media. 
 
The examiner has to be sure that the image is created and preserved in a manner that will 
withstand a legal challenge; therefore, before  imaging a hard drive, the examiner must 
determine the best method for acquiring an image and the proper procedures to facilitate the 
image capture.

During the imaging process, examiners should use some type of write-protection device or 
application to ensure no information is written onto the original drive, and after the hard 
drive is duplicated, the original drive is moved to a secure location to prevent tampering.
