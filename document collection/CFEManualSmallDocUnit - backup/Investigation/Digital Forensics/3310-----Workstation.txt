Workstation 
In addition to investigating the suspect’s mainframe, it is also important to investigate the 
suspect’s workstation, including any peripherals or other portable media devices that can be 
used to transmit or store data. As data moves to and from peripheral devices, it leaves 
evidence of its presence and sometimes leaves full copies of its contents.  
 
Therefore, fraud examiners should consider the many different types of peripherals that 
might contain evidence. Items to be seized might include any or all of the following items 
listed below, depending upon the nature of the fraud case.
