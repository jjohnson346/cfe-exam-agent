DELETED DATA 
Deletion is a widely misunderstood function in computing because deleting data is not the 
same as destroying data. Choosing the delete option erases the file’s reference from the table 
of contents, but it does not erase the file; in fa ct, data is not erased from a computer’s hard 
drive until the file is overwritten.
