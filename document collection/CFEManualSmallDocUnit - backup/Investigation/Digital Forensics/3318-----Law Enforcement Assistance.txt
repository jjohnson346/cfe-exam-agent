Law Enforcement Assistance 
Before conducting a forensic examination, examiners must consider whether a crime has in 
fact been committed. If, at the beginning of the investigation, it is determined that the victim 
company will make a formal referral to law enforcement or prosecuting agency, then the 
authorities must be notified before the investigation begins to determine whether law 
enforcement personnel should participate in the examination. In some jurisdictions, an 
examiner from the law enforcement community may not be available.
