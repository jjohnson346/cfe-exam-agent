Preparation 
Before the examiner can seize evidence, he must take certain steps to help ensure that the 
evidence is admissible: he must determine whether an employee has a privacy interest in the 
item(s) to be searched, he must take certain steps to prepare for an investigation that 
involves the use of a search warrant, and he must take steps to ensure that his equipment is 
sound (e.g., only use licensed software applications, independently validate all forensic 
equipment, and maintain the validation on file).
