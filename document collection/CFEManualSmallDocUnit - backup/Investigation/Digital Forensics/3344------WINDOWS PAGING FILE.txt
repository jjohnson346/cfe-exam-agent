WINDOWS PAGING FILE 
Operating systems have a limited supply of Random Access Memory (RAM), and if an 
operating system runs out of physical RAM and needs more memory, it will move some of 
the data outside physical memory and store it temporarily in a special file on the hard disk. 
This file, which is called a paging file or a swap file, is used to simulate RAM.
