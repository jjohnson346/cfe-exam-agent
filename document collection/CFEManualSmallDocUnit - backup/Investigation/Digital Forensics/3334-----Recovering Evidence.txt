Recovering Evidence 
In addition to live files, a wealth of information can be recovered and analyzed on seized 
systems. Because Windows operating systems are the most widely used, knowledge about the 
file systems—methods used to store and organi ze computer files and the data they contain 
for easy access—used by the Windows operating system is critical. Knowledge of the 
Windows operating system will help the examiner locate relevant evidence that is commonly 
found in files stored on hard drives, storage devices, and media.  
 
Common files containing evidence stored in the operating system include user-created files, 
user-protected files, and computer-created files.
