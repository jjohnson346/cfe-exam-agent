Computer-created Files 
Evidence may also be found in information generated by the operating systems. This type of 
information is important because it can identify that a certain activity has taken place, and, in 
most cases, the user is not aware that it is being written. Some common examples of 
computer-generated data available for examination include: metadata, registry, paging file, 
event logs, LNK files, Internet activity, temporary data, deleted data, and printer-spool files.
