LNK FILES 
LNK files, which are also called shortcuts, refer (or link) to target files that may be 
applications, documents, or system resources. Clicking on a LNK file will either cause the 
application to start or the document to open, and will prompt the applicable system 
resources to run. Although the user may create these files, the system generally creates them 
when a user performs certain tasks. These files, therefore, provide a “history” of previously 
opened documents and files.
