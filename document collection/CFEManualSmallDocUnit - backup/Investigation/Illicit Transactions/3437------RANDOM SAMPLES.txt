RANDOM SAMPLES 
When using the discovery-sampling technique, the selection of samples should be done 
randomly. For a sample to be random, every member of the population must have an equal 
opportunity of being selected.  
 
Items in the population can be numbered and selected by reference to a random number 
table. Or if the items in the population already have numbers (such as check numbers or 
invoice numbers) then a random sample can be selected by using a random number 
generator from a computer software program. To select a random sample, (1) identify a 
number for every item in the population, (2) correspond the random numbers with each 
item in the population, (3) select the route through the random number table, and (4) select 
the sample.  
 
Additionally, make sure that you consistently follow the pattern picked for corresponding 
random numbers to items in the population and that you document the random number 
selection process in the event the sample needs rechecking or additional sample items need 
to be selected for testing. If the sample is selected randomly and the sample is large enough, 
then the sample should represent the population.
