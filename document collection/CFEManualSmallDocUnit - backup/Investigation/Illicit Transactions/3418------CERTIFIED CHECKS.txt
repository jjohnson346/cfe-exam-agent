CERTIFIED CHECKS 
Certified checks  are customer’s checks stamped with the paying bank’s guarantee that the 
maker’s signature is genuine and that there is enough money available in the holder’s account  
to cover the amount to be paid.  Certified checks are liabilities of the bank and, when paid, 
are kept by the bank. These checks are immediately charged against the customer’s account 
by debit memorandums. Some banks permit customers to retrieve the original checks by 
surrendering the debit memorandum.
