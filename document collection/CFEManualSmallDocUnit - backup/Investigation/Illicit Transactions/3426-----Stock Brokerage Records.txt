Stock Brokerage Records 
Many stock brokerage houses now offer the same type of services as banks, such as check-
 writing privileges, credit cards, loans (against the value of securities held), as well as their 
normal securities business. All records pertaining to the subject should be requested; 
however, make sure that the request specifically includes the following: 
• Application: When a customer opens an account, he typically will fill out an account 
application that will contain personal and financial data, such as bank accounts. 
• Customer account cards:  This card is kept in the broker’s files for reference. It will include all 
transactions conducted for the customer. 
• Signature card: A signature card should be on file, which will show all those authorized to 
conduct transactions on the account. 
• Securities receipts:  These receipts are issued to a customer when he delivers securities to the 
broker for sale. 
• Cash receipts: These receipts are issued to a customer when he delivers currency to the 
broker. 
• Confirmation slips: These are issued to a customer to show the type of transaction (buy or 
sell) and the amount involved in the transaction. 
• Securities delivered receipt:  This receipt is signed by the customer when a securities purchase 
is delivered to the customer. 
• Brokerage account statement: This statement is usually issued monthly and provides 
information on all transactions conducted during the reporting period. It lists all 
purchases and sales, the name of the security, the number of units, the amount per unit, 
the total amount of the transaction, the account balance, payments received from the

customer, disbursements to the customer, and the securities that are held by the 
brokerage firm for the customer. 
 
Concerning stock brokerage records, the examiner is primarily interested in the source of the 
funds used to purchase securities or deposited to a cash account. The subject’s monthly 
account statements, which are somewhat more complex than equivalent bank statements, 
reflect these transactions. They can be interpreted with the help of explanatory material on 
the statement or with the assistance of an employee of the firm. Receipts for stock purchases 
and deposits should reflect whether the payment was in currency or check and the ABA 
code of the bank on which the check was drawn. Brokerage checks issued to the subject 
from stock sale proceeds also should be examined, as these might be deposited directly to a 
new account or endorsed over and paid directly to third parties for the purchase of assets.
