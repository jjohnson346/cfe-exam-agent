Office of International Affairs 
The U.S. Department of Justice, Office of International Affairs (OIA), in certain 
circumstances, can offer assistance to U.S. fraud examiners seeking to recover  
offshore assets. 
 
OIA is responsible for: 
• Extradition requests 
• Requests for foreign documentary evidence, bank and business records, and other 
official documents 
• Interviews and depositions of foreign witnesses 
• Assistance to obtain appearance of foreign witnesses in U.S. courts 
• Foreign searches and seizures, compelled handwriting exemplars, and  
electronic surveillance 
 
The OIA uses a number of legal resources to  obtain information from foreign countries, 
such as letters rogatory and Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties  (MLATs).
