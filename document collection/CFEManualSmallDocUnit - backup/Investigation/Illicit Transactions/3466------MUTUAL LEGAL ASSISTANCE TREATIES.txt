MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATIES 
Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) are treaties between the United States and 
foreign countries that provide for the exchange of information and documents relating to 
narcotics, money laundering, and other financial crimes.  
 
Requests for foreign assistance under Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) are usually 
quicker and more efficient than filing Letters Rogatory. The procedure for making formal 
requests by MLAT is as follows: 
• No U.S. court involvement is required. 
• The prosecutor calls the OIA for guidance and will send a draft request to the OIA for 
editing. 
• When the OIA director approves the request, the OIA transmits the request to the 
foreign central or competent authority. 
• If a translation is required, the requesting agency is responsible for obtaining it. 
• The OIA transmits the translation to the requested country. 
• The requested country’s proper authority determines whether the request meets treaty 
requirements and, if it does, transmits the request to the appropriate recorder agency  
 for execution. 
• The executing authority transmits the evidence through the proper authority to the OIA, 
which forwards it to the prosecutor. 
• The fraud examiner/prosecutor should inspect the evidence for responsiveness and 
completeness, as well as certificates of authenticity of business records (notify the OIA at 
once of any problems). 
 
The United States currently has bilateral MLATs in force with the following countries: 
Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, 
Belgium, Brazil, British Virgin Islands, Ca nada, the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Cyprus,

Another method of obtaining foreign bank or business records is by obtaining a release and 
consent form from the defendant. Execution of such a waiver can be compelled by order of 
a U.S. court. This procedure is not universally accepted, particularly in Switzerland, the 
Channel Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands, or the Cayman Islands.
