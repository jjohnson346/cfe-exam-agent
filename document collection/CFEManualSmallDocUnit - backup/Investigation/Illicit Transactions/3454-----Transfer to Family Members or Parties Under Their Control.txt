Transfer to Family Members or Parties Under Their Control 
The most common means of hiding assets, particularly real estate and business interests, is to 
transfer the asset into the hands of another party that will allow the target to maintain 
control. In many cases, the target will transfer the asset to a spouse (or another member of 
the spouse’s family), and a husband might make the transfer in his wife’s maiden name. 
 
Such transfers can be identified through a search of voter registrations, marriage records, and 
probate in the spouse’s maiden name. Transf ers to family members can be detected by 
comparing the target’s previous financial statem ent with the most recent one. Those assets 
appearing on the oldest statement but not appearing on the most recent statement should be 
examined closely to determine the nature of the transaction, the purchaser’s identity, and the 
consideration for the sale.
