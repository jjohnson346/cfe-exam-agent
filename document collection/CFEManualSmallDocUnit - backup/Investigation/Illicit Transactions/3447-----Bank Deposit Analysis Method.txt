Bank Deposit Analysis Method 
The bank deposit analysis method is another method to prove unknown sources of funds by 
indirect or circumstantial evidence. Like the other indirect methods of proof, the bank 
deposits method computes income by showing what happened to a subject’s funds. It is 
based on the theory that if a subject receives money, he can only do two things with it: he 
can deposit it or he can spend it.  
 
This method is applied when assets and liabilities are fairly constant from year to year and 
indications of extravagant expenditures are non-existent, but through investigation, the 
suspect’s known sources of income are being deposited into financial institutions. 
 
Under this method, income is proved through analyzing bank deposits, canceled checks, and 
the subject’s currency transactions. Adjustments for non-income items are made to arrive at 
income. A basic formula for the bank deposits method is: 
 
Total Deposits to All Accounts  
– Transfer and redeposits 
= Net deposits to all accounts 
+ Cash expenditures 
= Total receipts from all sources 
– Funds from known sources 
= Funds from unknown or illegal sources 
 
The bank deposits method is recommended as a primary method of proof when most of the 
subject’s income is deposited and the subject’s books and records are unavailable, withheld, 
incomplete, or maintained on a cash basis. Use of the bank deposits method is not limited to 
these circumstances, however. Even though the target’s books and records might appear to 
be complete and accurate, the method can still be used and there is no requirement to 
disprove the accuracy of the books and records. 
 
The basic sources of information for this analysis include  interviews, analyses of the books 
and records, and analyses of the bank accounts. A thorough interview will determine the 
subject’s expenditures by cash and checks, identi fy all bank accounts, and determine all loans 
and other receipts.
