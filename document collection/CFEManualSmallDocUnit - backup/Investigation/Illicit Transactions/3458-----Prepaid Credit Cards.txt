Prepaid Credit Cards 
Many credit accounts today permit the card holder to prepay their accounts. Many people 
attempting to hide assets have used the prepayment option to hide cash from creditors. 
Prepayment of credit card accounts can also be found in cash management accounts (CMAs) 
offered by stock brokerage firms.
