Methods of Surveillance 
During loose surveillance, targets need not be kept under constant observation. The surveillance 
should be discontinued if the person becomes suspicious. In close surveillance, subjects are kept 
under observation continuously even if they appear to become suspicious. 
 
Circumstances might require a change from a loose to a close surveillance. Pre-planning 
helps, but the examiner must observe and interpret the act or circumstances to decide what 
tactic to employ. If the plan calls for loose surveillance until the completion of a specified 
act, or until a meeting with another person, after which the subject is to be put under close 
surveillance or apprehended, the observer must determine when the specific incident has 
taken place.
