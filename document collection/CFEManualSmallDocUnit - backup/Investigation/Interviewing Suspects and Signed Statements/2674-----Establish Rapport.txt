Establish Rapport 
Webster’s defines rapport as a “relation marked by harmony, conformity, accord, or affinity.” 
In other words, there must be some common ground established before questioning begins. 
This is usually accomplished by the interviewer spending a few minutes with the respondent 
in “small talk.” This aspect, however, should not be overdone. Most people are aware that 
the interviewer is there for a meaningful purpose and not to chitchat.
