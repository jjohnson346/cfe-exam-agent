Writing Down Questions 
Whenever possible, do not write down a list of interview questions. Let the interview flow 
freely. Inadvertently allowing the respondent to read a written list of questions can provide 
an opportunity to fabricate an answer. However, writing down key points the interviewer 
wants to discuss might be appropriate.
