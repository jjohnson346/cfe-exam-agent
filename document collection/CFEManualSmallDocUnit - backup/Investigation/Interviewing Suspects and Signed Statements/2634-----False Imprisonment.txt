False Imprisonment 
False imprisonment is the restraint by one person of the physical liberty of another without 
consent or legal justification. In the context of employee interviews, a claim of false 
imprisonment may be made if the interviewer locks the interview room, stands in front of 
the exit, or refuses to let the suspect leave.
