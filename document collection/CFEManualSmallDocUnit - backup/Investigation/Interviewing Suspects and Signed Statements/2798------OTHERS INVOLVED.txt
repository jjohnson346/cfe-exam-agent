OTHERS INVOLVED 
Most frauds are solo ventures—committed wit hout the aid of an accomplice. Rather than 
ask if anyone else was involved, phrase the question something like this. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, who else knew about this besides you?” 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.269 
By asking who else “knew,” the interviewer is  in effect not only asking for the names of 
possible conspirators, but also about others who might have known what was going on and 
failed to report it. This question should not be worded as, “did someone else know?” but rather 
“who else knew?”
