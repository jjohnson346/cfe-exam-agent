Altruistic Appeals 
There seems to be a need for humans to identify with some higher value or cause beyond 
immediate self-interest. This might sometimes take the form of identification with the 
objectives of a larger group. Altruistic deeds usually increase self-esteem, whether or not the 
deeds have been made public. This distinguishes altruism from publicity. Altruism is of 
major importance in motivating many respondents. Interviewers who understand the 
respondent’s value system can use strategy and techniques that appeal to altruism.
