REFUSAL TO IMPLICATE OTHER SUSPECTS 
Both the honest respondent and the liar will have a natural reluctance to name others 
involved in misdeeds. However, the liar will frequently refuse to implicate possible suspects, 
no matter how much pressure is applied by the interviewer. This is because the culpable 
person does not want the circle of suspicion to be narrowed.
