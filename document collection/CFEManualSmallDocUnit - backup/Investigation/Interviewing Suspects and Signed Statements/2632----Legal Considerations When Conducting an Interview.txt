Legal Considerations When Conducting an Interview 
Interviews, and especially admission-seeking interviews, may expose the company and the 
fraud examiner to certain legal risks. Thus, before engaging in an interview, fraud examiners 
must understand the ramifications of their actions. This requires an understanding of certain 
legal issues and how they limit or affect the ways in which an interview may be conducted. 
However, because employee rights vary from case to case, fraud examiners should always 
consult with an attorney regarding the specific laws and regulations for their state or locality.
