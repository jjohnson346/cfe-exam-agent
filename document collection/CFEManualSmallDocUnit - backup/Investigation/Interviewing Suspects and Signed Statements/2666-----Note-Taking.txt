Note-Taking 
The interviewer will frequently need to take notes during the interview. Start each interview 
on a separate sheet of paper. This procedure can be especially helpful should documents 
from a particular interview be subpoenaed. Do not try to write down all the information you 
are given during an interview, only the pertinent facts. Taking too many notes will make the 
interview process cumbersome and might inhibit the respondent. If a quote is particularly 
relevant, try to write it down verbatim. Enclose all direct quotes in quotation marks. 
 
Do not slow down the interview process for note taking. Instead, jot down key words or 
phrases, and then go back over the details at the end of the interview. In general, it is better 
to err on the side of taking too few notes rather than too many.
