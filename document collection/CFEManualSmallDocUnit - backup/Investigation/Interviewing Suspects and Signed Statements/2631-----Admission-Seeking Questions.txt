Admission-Seeking Questions 
The choice of when to conduct an admission-seeking interview of a suspect is critical. 
Admission-seeking interviews are reserved specifically for individuals whose culpability is 
reasonably certain; all other reasonable investigative steps have been completed and as much 
information as possible has been developed from other sources; and the interviewer can 
reasonably control the place, time, and subject matter of the interview.  
 
Admission-seeking questions serve at least two purposes: (1) to clear an innocent person or 
(2) to encourage the culpable person to confess. However, the interviewer must be careful to 
pose these questions in a way that does not violate the rights and privileges of the person 
being interviewed.
