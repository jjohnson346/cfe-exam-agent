Reconstruct the Circumstances of the Event 
In this first, important step, the interviewer should ask the eyewitness to describe the context 
in which the incident occurred. The interviewer should ask the witness to describe 
everything, including the weather, time of day, and look and feel of the environment in 
which the incident took place. What did the people and/or objects in the surroundings  
look like?

The objective of this step is to mentally return the witness to the scene so that he will vividly 
recall the unfolding events. Asking the witness to describe the emotional state he was in at 
the time of the occurrence often helps accomplish this first step.
