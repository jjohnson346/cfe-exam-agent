Preparation 
Before embarking on an interview, the examiner should review the case file to ensure that it 
does not contain important information that has been overlooked. In addition, the examiner 
should review the case file to learn what information is known to the witness. The 
hypothesis should be reviewed to make sure it reflects the obtained documents. 
 
The examiner should consider what type of information can be supplied by each of the 
potential witnesses. Generally, the most vulnerable witness should be interviewed after the 
more reluctant witnesses. This will provide the examiner with a broader base of information 
that can be used to formulate later questions. However, the timing of interviews is at the 
discretion of the examination team.
