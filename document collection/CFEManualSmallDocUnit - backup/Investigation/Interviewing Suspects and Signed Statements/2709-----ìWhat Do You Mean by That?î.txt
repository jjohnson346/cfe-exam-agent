“What Do You Mean by That?” 
When the respondent asks this question, it might represent a symptom of mild resistance 
with which the respondent is attempting to shift the attention from himself to the 
interviewer. It also might be a way for the respondent to stall for time while deliberating. Or 
it could be that the respondent is not sure what the interviewer’s question means. The 
interviewer should typically react to such a question by treating it as a mere request for 
clarification. The interviewer should not become defensive; to do so generally will escalate 
the resistance.
