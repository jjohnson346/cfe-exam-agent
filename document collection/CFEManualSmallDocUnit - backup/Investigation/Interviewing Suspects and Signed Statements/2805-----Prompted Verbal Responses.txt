Prompted Verbal Responses 
Prompted verbal responses can help an interrogator to differentiate an honest person from a 
deceitful one. By utilizing a series of structured questions, we can generally get a good 
indication of how truthful the subject is. These should be woven into a casual conversation 
so that the subject is not aware of the significance of the questions. The structured questions 
must not appear to be interrogational in manner.
