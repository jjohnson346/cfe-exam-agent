DEPERSONALIZING THE VICTIM 
In cases involving employee theft, an effective technique is to depersonalize the victim. The 
accused is better able to cope with the moral dilemma of his actions if the victim is a faceless 
corporation or agency. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, it isn’t like you took something from a friend or neighbor. I can see how you could say, 
‘Well, this would be okay to do as long as it  was against the company,  and not my coworkers.’ 
Is that right, Linda?” 
OR 
“E. J., it’s not like what you’ve done has really  hurt one person. Maybe you thought of it this 
way: ‘At most, I’ve cost each shareholder a few cents.’ Is that the way it was, E. J.?”
