Disarm the Person 
A common mistake is to try to reason with an unreceptive person. You must disarm the 
hostile person. The best tactic is surprise. If the person is stonewalling, he expects the 
interviewer to apply pressure; if attacking, the person expects the interviewer to resist. To 
disarm the person, listen, acknowledge the point, and agree wherever you can.
