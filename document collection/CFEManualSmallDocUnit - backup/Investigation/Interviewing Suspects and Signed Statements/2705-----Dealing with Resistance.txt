Dealing with Resistance 
There is always the possibility that the respondent will refuse a request for interview. When 
the respondent and the interviewer have no connection, studies show that as many as 65 
percent of the respondents will refuse an interview if contacted first by telephone. In 
contrast, one study concluded that only one-third of respondents will be reluctant to be 
interviewed when contacted in person. The more unpleasant the topic, the more likely the 
respondent is to refuse.  
 
With inexperienced interviewers, there is a danger that the interviewer will perceive 
resistance when there is none. As a result, the interviewer might become defensive. It is 
incumbent upon the interviewer to overcome such feelings to complete the interview. The 
following are specific examples of the types of resistance that will be encountered and how 
to try to overcome them.
