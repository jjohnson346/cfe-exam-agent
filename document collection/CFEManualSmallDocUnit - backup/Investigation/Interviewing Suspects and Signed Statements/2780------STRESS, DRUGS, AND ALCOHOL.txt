STRESS, DRUGS, AND ALCOHOL 
Employees will sometimes turn to drugs or alcohol to reduce stress. In some instances, the 
stress itself will lead to aberrant behavior in a few individuals. A rationalization established 
by the interviewer could be similar to the following. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I know what you’ve done isn’t really you. Inside, you have been in a lot of turmoil. A 
lot of people drink too much when they have problems. I have been through periods like that 
myself. And when things build up inside, it sometimes makes all of us do something we 
shouldn’t. That’s what happened here, isn’t it, Linda?” 
OR 
“E. J., you’re one of the most respected men in this company. I know you have been under 
tremendous pressure to succeed. Too much pressure, really. There is only so much any of us can 
take. That’s behind what has happened here, isn’t it, E. J.?”
