FEIGNED UNCONCERN 
The dishonest person will often try to appear casual and unconcerned, will frequently adopt 
an unnatural slouching posture, and might react to questions with nervous or false laughter 
or feeble attempts at humor. The honest person, conversely, will typically be very concerned 
about being suspected of wrongdoing, and will treat the interviewer’s questions seriously.
