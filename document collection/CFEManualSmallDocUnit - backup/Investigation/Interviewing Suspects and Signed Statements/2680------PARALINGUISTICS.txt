PARALINGUISTICS 
Paralinguistic communication involves the use of volume, pitch, and voice quality to convey 
meaning. One of the basic differences between  written and verbal communication is that 
oral speech gives the full range of nonverbal accompaniment. For example, a “yes” response 
might not mean complete agreement; it depends on the way in which the “yes” is said. 
 
The interviewer must learn to listen and observe changes in the nonverbal accompaniment 
and whether the verbal and nonverbal are harmoniously reinforcing or tend to give 
conflicting signals, as in cases where the respondent is trying to deceive the interviewer. Ten 
emotions have been studied by social scientists: anger, fear, happiness, jealousy, love, 
nervousness, pride, sadness, satisfaction, and sympathy. Some emotions, like anger and 
nervousness, can be more reliably identified than the others.
