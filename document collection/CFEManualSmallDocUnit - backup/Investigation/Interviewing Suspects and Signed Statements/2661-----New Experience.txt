New Experience 
People welcome new experiences. Although variety might not be the only spice of life, 
escape from the dreary routine is sought by everyone. Sometimes the respondent is 
motivated by curiosity regarding the interviewer. Interviewers should consider this when 
deciding what to say about themselves. One must not assume that just because an interview 
is a new experience, it will satisfy the respondent’s needs. Aspects of the respondent’s 
perception of the new experience can be ego threatening. The respondent might be anxious 
about the impression left with the interviewer. This apprehensiveness can often be detected 
by the interviewer at the beginning of the contact. Once these fears are dispelled, the 
respondent frequently finds the interview a new and interesting experience.
