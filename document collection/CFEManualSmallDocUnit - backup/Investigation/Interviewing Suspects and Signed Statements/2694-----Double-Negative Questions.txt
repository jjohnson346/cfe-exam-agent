Double-Negative Questions 
Questions or statements containing double-negatives are confusing and often suggest an 
answer opposite to the correct one. They should not be used. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Didn’t you suspect that something wasn’t right?” (What does a negative answer  
mean here?)
