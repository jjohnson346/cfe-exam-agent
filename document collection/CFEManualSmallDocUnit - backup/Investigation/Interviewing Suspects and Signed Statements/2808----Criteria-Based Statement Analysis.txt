Criteria-Based Statement Analysis 
When collecting witness accounts or interviews concerning a particular fraud case, fraud 
examiners must continually assess how honest the interviewee has been. Criteria-based 
statement analysis can be utilized as a tool to uncover just how truthful a subject has been 
after the interview is complete. This technique is different than a kinesic interview in that the 
fraud examiner is not analyzing the body language or nonverbal clues a subject has given, but 
instead the language used by the subject.  
 
Statement analysis is based on the notion that when humans speak, whether intentionally or 
unconsciously, we specifically select the language we use. In general, the verbal clues that a 
subject offers while speaking are just as prominent as any nonverbal tip-offs. The tense that 
an interviewee uses is often the indication that the interviewee knows more than he is  
letting on.  
 
For instance, in the well-publicized case of Susan Smith in 1995, Smith claimed that a 
carjacker forced her out of her car and drove away with her two children in the back seat. 
When the children’s father spoke of the missing toddlers, he spoke of them in present tense;

when Smith mentioned them, investigators noticed that she continually referred to the boys 
in the past tense, indicating that she knew them to be deceased. Upon interrogation, Smith 
confessed to driving the car into a lake, killing her children.
