Purpose of Questions 
Admission-seeking questions have at least three purposes. The first purpose is to distinguish 
innocent people from guilty. A culpable individual will frequently confess during the 
admission-seeking phase of an interview, while an innocent person will not do so unless 
threats or coercion are used. In some instances, the only way to differentiate the culpable 
from the innocent is to seek an admission of guilt.  
 
The second purpose is to obtain a valid confession. Confessions, under the law, must be 
voluntarily obtained. The importance of a valid and binding confession to wrongdoing 
cannot be overstated. The third purpose of admission-seeking questions is to convince the 
confessor to sign a written statement acknowledging the facts. Although oral confessions are 
legally as binding as written ones, the written statement has greater credibility. It also 
discourages miscreants from later attempting to recant.
