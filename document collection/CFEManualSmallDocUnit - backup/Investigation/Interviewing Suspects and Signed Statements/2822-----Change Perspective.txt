Change Perspective 
The final step of the cognitive interview process is to get the witness to alter his perspective 
of the event. The investigator should ask him to reconstruct the scenario and assume a 
different position within the situation. For instance, ask the witness to pretend to be a 
different person within the event, and recount the event from that perspective. What was the 
other person thinking or feeling? This technique may seem a bit odd, but it may allow the 
witness to consider various elements of the event that he previously had not.
