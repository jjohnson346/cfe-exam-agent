:


Instruct the Eyewitness to Report Everything and Be Complete 
In this stage, the interviewer should ask the eyewitness to recount every last detail as 
completely as possible. Geiselman says that a witness will often withhold information that he 
thinks may be relevant to the investigation. Therefore, the investigator should instruct the 
witness not to omit anything when giving testimony, no matter how trivial the information 
might seem. The small details that the witness remembers during the interview may not be 
directly beneficial to the investigation, but they will be important to helping the witness 
remember the events descriptively and thoroughly.
