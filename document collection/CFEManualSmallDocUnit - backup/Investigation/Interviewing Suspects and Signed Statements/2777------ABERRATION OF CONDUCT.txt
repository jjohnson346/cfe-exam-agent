ABERRATION OF CONDUCT 
Many miscreants believe their conduct constitutes  an aberration in their lives and that it is 
not representative of their true character. The interviewer might establish this theme by 
applying the following examples. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I know this is totally out of character for you. I know that this would never have 
happened if something wasn’t going on in your life. Isn’t that right, Linda?” 
OR 
“ E. J., you’ve worked hard all your life to get a good reputation. I feel you wouldn’t normally 
have done something like this; it  just doesn’t fit unless you felt like you were forced into it. You 
felt forced to do this, didn’t you, E. J.?”
