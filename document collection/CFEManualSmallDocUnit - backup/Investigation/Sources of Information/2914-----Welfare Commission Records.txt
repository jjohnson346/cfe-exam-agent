Welfare Commission Records 
Files of a county welfare commission are based on information gathered by social workers, 
psychologists, and physicians. Frequently, the recipient of benefits provides the information, 
which is generally not verified. Files contain such information as the recipient’s address, 
previous employment, how much the recipient earned, property the recipient or the 
recipient’s relatives might own, the state of the family’s health, and criminal records.
