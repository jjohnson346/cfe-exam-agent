Criminal Court Records 
When conducting a criminal records search, certain types of information are critical. Like 
civil courts, criminal courts across the country are divided into jurisdictions that generally 
encompass a single county in a single state. 
 
Although most states have their criminal courts divided by county, some states offer indexes 
with criminal convictions for the entire state.  
 
Criminal convictions should not be confused with criminal filings. When you search for 
criminal records at the county level, you will find all cases filed by the district attorney, even 
if the person was not found guilty of a crime. When searching a statewide convictions 
database, you will find only cases that resulted in conviction.  
The county criminal court clerk maintains criminal court files that might contain a wealth of 
information. These files might provide information describing the offenses and the counts. 
These files also might contain the complainant’s signature (exemplar); a transcript of the 
preliminary hearing; the names of the prosecuting and defense attorneys; the probation 
officer’s report, with a background investigation of the defendant; and the subpoenas issued 
in the case.
