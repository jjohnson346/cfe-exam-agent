GOOGLE  
Google is the most-used search engine in the United States and has advanced search 
capabilities. Individual Web pages are ranked by the engine’s software according to how 
often the page is linked to by others, determining the page’s “importance” by the number of 
links and the identity of the linking page. Google is a good source for finding targeted 
information on a particular topic. Additionally, learning Google-specific search operators will 
provide the investigator with an extremely powerful tool for online investigations. 
 
For example, Google Groups is a searchable Usenet archive. It scans thousands of postings 
of Usenet groups, which are electronic bulletin boards classified by subject (see 
“Newsgroups” below). A search using Google Groups will reveal instances in which the 
terms you specify appear in a posting on the Internet. You can search by the name or e-mail 
address of users who have posted to newsgroups, or by subject, keywords, attachments, and 
so on.
