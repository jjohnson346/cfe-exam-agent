Credit Records 
Practically all lines of business have specialized credit-reporting associations that can provide 
credit information on individuals and businesses, including trade information, designation of 
lenders and creditors, types of businesses, date accounts were opened, terms of payment 
agreed upon, highest credit, balance owing, and paying habits. Some credit reports also give 
the name of the bank the subject does business with and the size of the subject’s accounts.  
 
In the United States, most consumer credit information is collected and maintained by the 
three national credit-reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Generally, a 
subscription is required to obtain information from these sources, and their dissemination is 
governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The FCRA places restrictions on when a 
consumer credit report can be obtained and used. In many cases, the consumer must be 
notified or must consent to the use of the report for employment purposes. Please consult 
the information on the FCRA presented previously in this chapter for more information 
about the legality of obtaining and using consumer credit reports.  
 
Credit reports are provided by credit reporting agencies, also known as credit bureaus. Credit 
reporting agencies are local or national institutions that collect data from various sources on 
individual consumer creditworthiness and report that data to their members or subscribers.  
 
There are essentially two types of credit reporting agencies. The first is known as a file-based 
credit reporting agency, which develops its information from credit files and public records. The 
other type is known as an investigative credit reporting agency, which gathers most of its 
information through interviews.  
 
Credit reporting agencies typically maintain the following information: 
• Consumer information, such as address, age, family members, employers, income levels, 
length of employment, the extent of other obligations, and the like 
• Account information, such as payment schedules, items purchased, defaults (if any), and 
buying habits

• Marketing information, such as customers brok en down by age, sex, income levels, and 
other classifications 
• Information on current and former employers 
 
Information on the creditworthiness of a business organization may also be obtained from 
credit reporting agencies. The responses for such searches may include payment trends from 
creditors, public records (such as UCC filings and tax liens), banking information, and key 
facts as to the type of business and ownership. But unlike consumer credit information, 
business credit information is not restricted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
 
Generally, credit reporting agencies obtain their information from the following sources: 
• Consumers, primarily from filling out application forms for credit. 
• Public records, which provide information on bankruptcies, court judgments, 
foreclosures, divorces, criminal convictions, registered chattel mortgages, and registered 
agreements.  
• The major credit grantors and collection agencies, which, as subscribers, regularly send 
their credit files electronically to the credit bureaus, resulting in files that include the 
account number, outstanding balance, and a nine-point scale indicating whether a 
payment was made on time.  
• Many credit grantors and collection agencies  only report payment information to one of 
the three national credit-reporting agencies, but larger creditors may report to more than 
one bureau. Some creditors, like utility companies, only report delinquent activity. Since 
the big three agencies do not share data among themselves, there will be differences 
between the credit reports from each credit bureau. 
 
In a typical credit information request, the potential creditor calls the credit bureau (or 
makes an online request) for information, and the creditor receives details regarding other 
credit histories of the individual, such as payment schedules and delinquencies.  
 
Information maintained by credit reporting agencies is regularly updated at the request of the 
consumer or by request of the credit grantor.
