Specific Search Operators 
Online researchers rely on search engines to search Web pages for specified keywords and 
return a list of the Web pages containing the keywords. Although these engines return 
results instantly and with little effort, the simplicity of these tools often removes the benefits 
of more complex searching techniques. To determine a search engine or database’s abilities, 
consult the service’s FAQ or search help page. 
 
This section examines the advanced search features of the Google and Bing because they 
provide some of the most robust and useful tools for experts conducting searches.
