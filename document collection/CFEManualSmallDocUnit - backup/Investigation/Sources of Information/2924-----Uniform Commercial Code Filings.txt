Uniform Commercial Code Filings 
A search of Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) filings can help you identify personal 
property that an individual or business has financed. This is because a lender must file UCC 
statements with the secretary of state or with the county level unit to perfect its security 
interest in personal property. 
 
Banks, finance companies, and other lenders will generate records or recorded filings of 
financial transactions conducted with individuals and businesses, such as purchases of 
household furniture, appliances, boats and yachts, automobiles, aircraft, and business 
equipment. 
 
These filings produced as the result of the transactions will identify: 
• Name of the debtor or joint debtors 
• Current address of the debtors 
• Name of the financial lender 
• Type of collateral pledged as security 
• Date of filing and continuations 
 
UCC filings can also disclose when and where a person obtains personal loans, the type of 
property pledged to the lender to secure the loan, and the current address of the debtor. 
These documents provide itemized lists of personal property held by the debtor. 
 
Additionally, UCC filings and supporting documents can help examiners uncover hidden 
ownership or relationships between parties by viewing the names of all listed debtors and

their addresses. The examiner may find information linking individuals to the companies 
they own, or discover information about a company’s subsidiaries, branch offices, or parent 
company.  
 
These documents can be readily retrieved from the secretary of state’s office, through service 
companies, or through online public records services. One company that provides access to 
this information is Experian. Experian’s UCC online database provides information from 
state-level UCC-1 financing statements, as well as information on amendments, assignments, 
terminations, and so on. Most online responses will include debtor and secured party 
name(s) and address(es), file date and file number for each original filing, amendment dates, 
and assignment information (when applicable).
