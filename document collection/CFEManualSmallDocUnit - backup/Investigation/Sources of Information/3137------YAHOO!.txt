YAHOO!  
In addition to its search engine, Yahoo! has an intricate directory, possibly the most 
comprehensive and all-inclusive on the Internet. The directory is built and maintained by 
Yahoo! employees, with input from users. Yahoo! functions much like a pyramid: it begins 
with several large pools of categories, such as entertainment and government, and then 
allows the user to select more specific options from each broad category. For instance, an 
examiner could select “education,” then “universities,” then “university libraries,” until 
finally encountering a direct link to the main library catalog for the University of Texas. By 
paring down your selections to increasingly narrow topics, you can generally find several 
useful websites.
