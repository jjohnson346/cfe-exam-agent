Complying with the FCRA 
Before an employer can obtain consumer information about a current or prospective 
employee from a third party, it must comply with all of the following requirements: 
• Provide the individual with a “clear and conspicuous” separate written disclosure that 
the employer might obtain a report 
• Obtain the individual’s written authorization 
• Inform the third party that the employer has complied with the FCRA’s notice 
requirements 
• Inform the third party that the employer will not use the information to violate any equal 
employment law 
 
The disclosure and the authorization can be contained in the same document, as long as the 
document contains nothing else.

If the employer relies on a consumer report for an “adverse action” (e.g., denying a job 
application, reassigning or terminating an employee, or denying a promotion), then it must 
provide the individual with a pre-adverse action disclosure before taking the adverse action. 
This disclosure must include a copy of the individual’s consumer report and a copy of “A 
Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act,” which is available from  
the FTC. 
 
After adverse action is taken, the employer must notify the individual via an adverse action 
notice that the action has been taken. That notice must include the following: 
• Name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting agency (CRA) that 
supplied the report; 
• A statement that the CRA did not make the adverse action decision and cannot explain 
why the adverse action was taken; and 
• A notice of the individual’s right to di spute the accuracy or completeness of the 
information furnished, and his right to an additional free consumer report from the 
agency upon request within 60 days. 
 
If, however, the employer is gathering the consumer information in connection with a 
workplace investigation of misconduct, however, it may be excluded from the FCRA (see 
the section “
