General Services Administration 
The General Services Administration (GSA) has considerable information on architects, 
engineers, personal property auctioneers, real estate appraisers, construction contractors, 
sales brokers, and businesses that contract with the GSA. The agency also maintains the 
“GSA Consolidated List,” a computerized roster of suspended and debarred bidders. 
 
The GSA is also responsible for the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS), which is an 
electronic, Web-based system that identifies parties that excluded from receiving federal 
contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of federal financial and nonfinancial 
assistance and benefits. The EPLS keeps its user community aware of suspected terrorists, 
individuals barred from entering the United States, and those subject to administrative and 
statutory exclusions. The user is able to search, view, and download both current and 
archived exclusions.
