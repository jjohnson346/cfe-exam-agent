MAMMA  
Mamma is a “smart” meta-search engine; every time users type in a query, Mamma 
simultaneously searches a variety of engines, directories, and content sites; properly formats 
the words and syntax for each; compiles their results in a virtual database; eliminates 
duplicates; and displays them in a uniform manner according to relevance.
