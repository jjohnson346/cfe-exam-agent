• Identification of owners of more than 10 percent of a business’s stock 
• A description of the registrant’s properties and businesses 
• A description of the significant provisions of the security to be offered for sale and its 
relationship to the registrant’s other capital securities 
• Identification of events of interest to investors 
• Identification of accountants and attorneys 
• A history of the business 
 
The SEC also maintains files on individuals and firms reported to it for violating federal or 
state securities laws. The information in these files pertains to official actions taken against 
such people and firms, including denials, refusals, suspensions, and revocations of 
registrations; injunctions, fraud orders, stop orders, and cease-and-desist orders; and arrests, 
indictments, convictions, sentences, and other official actions. 
 
Moreover, changes in beneficial ownership by officers, directors, and principal stockholders 
of securities listed and registered on a national securities exchange or of securities of public 
utility companies and certain closed-end investment companies can be accessed through the 
SEC’s EDGAR system, on the SEC’s website. Also, as of September 2008, this information 
can also be accessed on the SEC’s new IDEA (Interactive Data Electronic Applications) 
system. IDEA will at first supplement and then eventually replace the EDGAR system, 
which will become an archive of SEC filings made prior to the introduction of the IDEA 
system. 
 
Most of a company’s information filed with EDGAR and IDEA can be obtained in 
electronic form by using the online SEC search feature at www.sec.gov. To obtain paper 
copies of SEC records and documents, historic SEC filings, special reports and studies, 
speeches, and testimony, contact the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy at (202)
