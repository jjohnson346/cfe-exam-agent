Craigslist 
Craigslist.org is a network of online communities, featuring free classified advertisements 
with sections dedicated to jobs, housing, personals, items for sale, services, résumés, and so 
on.  
 
The key to searching Craigslist is getting past the geographic restriction. For example, if the 
examiner is looking for items in the Silicon Valley, he cannot search other areas at the same 
time. To expand the search, the examiner must specify another area or use 
SearchTempest.com, a tool that allows users to search multiple Craigslist sites at once.
