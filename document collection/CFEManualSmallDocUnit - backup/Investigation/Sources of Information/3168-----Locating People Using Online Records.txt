Locating People Using Online Records 
The first step to maximize search results is to discover a past address of the suspect; search 
activities should begin from that point. Second, the user should know the most powerful and 
useful types of searches, which are identified below. Third, it is important to keep in mind 
the cost effectiveness of the search activity and avoid ordering online searches that yield 
unnecessary or impractical information. 
 
The search methodology used by most online services is known as “text-string matching,” 
which means that all information entered in the data inquiry field will seek an exact match in 
the database. Typically, you may use truncation techniques (partial or abbreviated entries 
such as the first initial of the first name) only with first names and business names.  
 
Some common types of searches used to locate people using online records are discussed 
below.
