Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) instituted several 
additional privacy rules concerning personal health information. While most of the rules do 
not directly affect fraud investigations, fraud examiners should be aware of the rules because 
they may have an impact on the type of information that can be legally gathered on 
employees. 
 
Investigation  Sources of Information 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.411 
The HIPAA privacy rules place restrictions on the availability and use of “protected health 
information.” The definition of this term is extremely broad and covers any information 
relating to an individual’s past, present, or  future physical or mental health, payment for 
services, or health care operations. 
 
If information about the health of an individual or payments for services becomes an issue 
during an investigation, fraud examiners should immediately contact the human resources 
(HR) department. The HR department should have information about whether the entity is 
subject to HIPAA rules and can assist you in compliance with those rules.  
 
The most important thing to note is that if HIPAA rules do apply, you are restricted as to 
the type of health information you can access without specific written authorization. You 
should never contact the health care provider, the health-plan administrator, or a medical-
 billing service for copies of employee’s records without first consulting the employer’s legal 
counsel or the HR department.
