NON-COMMERCIAL SEARCHES 
Although examiners can use commercial services to obtain real property information (e.g., 
identify the ownership of a piece of real property), some jurisdictions are not available, 
depending on how local jurisdictions and states compile property information. Searches may 
be conducted by business or person name(s), address, or name of the putative owner. 
Searches of the real property records may reveal: 
• Residences and addresses of buyer and seller (referred to respectively as grantor and 
grantee) 
• Price of the property (see tax stamps if listed) 
• Mortgage company and amount originally financed 
• Real estate ownership 
• Who financed the transaction, if applicable 
• Title companies involved 
• Improvements to the property, along with the names and addresses of the contractors 
used
