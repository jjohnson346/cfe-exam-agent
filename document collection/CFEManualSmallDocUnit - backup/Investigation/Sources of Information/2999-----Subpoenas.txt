Subpoenas 
Subpoenas and other legal processes, such as depositions, interrogations, and document 
requests, are available if a civil action is filed. For example, a wronged organization may file a 
civil or administrative action or make a criminal referral so that records can be subpoenaed. 
In a civil case, records such as bank accounts, brokerage accounts, travel, credit card, credit 
agencies, and telephone toll records may be obtained by subpoena. 
 
Conversely, records subpoenaed in a criminal case usually are available only to the 
government during the investigation and perhaps thereafter if not disclosed at trial. In 
addition, law enforcement agencies may also subpoena records, of course, but usually will 
not disclose them to the victim or third parties.
