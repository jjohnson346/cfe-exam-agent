Probate Court Records 
Probate court records are documents filed to show the dispersal of assets after a subject’s 
death. The probate court conducts an investigation to verify any debts owed by an individual 
estate and sees to the dispersal of assets according to the deceased’s will (or if there is no 
will, by state law) after all debts are paid. 
 
The debts left in an individual’s estate will give the investigator information on the following: 
• Names of individuals with an interest in the deceased’s estate 
• The subject’s financial position at the time of death 
 
The dispersal of assets will reveal: 
• The names and addresses of heirs to the deceased 
• Some indication of the value of the property willed to them
