El Paso Intelligence Center 
The El Paso Intelligence Center’s (EPIC) mission is to provide timely and expeditious 
support to federal, state, local, tribal, and international law enforcement agencies. Prior to 
2001, EPIC provided entities a complete and accurate intelligence picture of worldwide 
movements of transportable drugs, weapons, and illegal aliens into the United States. It 
analyzed raw data and provided tactical and operational intelligence to agencies involved in 
the antidrug effort. EPIC also provided strategic assessments of drug movement and 
concealment techniques. After September 11th, 2001, EPIC was called upon to support 
investigations to find those responsible for the terrorist attacks, and its mission expanded to 
include counterterrorism efforts. 
 
EPIC member agencies include the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; 
Coast Guard; Department of Defense; Department of Homeland Security’s Customs and 
Border Protection; Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement; Department of the Interior; Drug Enforcement Administration; Federal 
Bureau of Investigation; Internal Revenue Service; Marshals Service; National Drug 
Intelligence Center; Secret Service; and Tr ansportation Security Administration.  
 
Initially EPIC focused on the United States-Mexico border with an emphasis on Mexico’s 
heroin traffickers and illegal alien smugglers, but with the increased use of aircraft, seagoing 
vessels, and global networks to facilitate drug trafficking, EPIC’s focus broadened and 
became international in scope. EPIC serves federal agencies, all 50 states, the District of
