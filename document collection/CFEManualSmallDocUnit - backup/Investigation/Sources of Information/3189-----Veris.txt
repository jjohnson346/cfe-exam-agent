Veris 
Veris is a Social Security validation service; it specializes in providing verification of Social 
Security numbers, possible mail drop addresses, dates of birth, and death records. Veris 
allows an investigator to match a Social Security number to a name; however, this service is 
costly (cost per search begins at $115, but the actual cost depends on the type of search and 
number of searches being conducted) but very accurate. Veris can be accessed at www.veris-ssn.com.
