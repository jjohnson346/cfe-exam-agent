National Automated Immigration Lookout System 
The National Automated Immigration Lookout System (NAILS) is a Bureau of Immigration 
and Custom Enforcement system. The system provides an index of the names of all 
individuals who might be denied entry into the United States. Names in NAILS are passed 
to the Treasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS); therefore, a search of 
NAILS is not necessary if TECS has been searched.
