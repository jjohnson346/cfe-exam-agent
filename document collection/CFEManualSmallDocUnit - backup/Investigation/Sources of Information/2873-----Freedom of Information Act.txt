Freedom of Information Act 
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is the primary Act that governs the availability of 
governmental records to the general public. The Act sets very specific guidelines regarding 
what governmental records are and are not open to the public. The records that are available 
are known as “public records,” raw records of information that are compiled and maintained 
by governmental agencies. The various records are maintained at one of the three 
governmental levels: federal, state, or county/ local. Although the FOIA is a federal Act, 
most states have adopted very similar versions of the FOIA to cover the state and local 
jurisdictions. While these versions are similar to the original FOIA, the individually passed 
state acts may differ slightly in specific legal areas from state to state.

The FOIA and its individual state counterparts regulate:  
• The type of records that a governmental agency may maintain about a person 
• The conditions under which such information may be disclosed to another governmental 
agency 
• The circumstances and methods under which an individual may obtain copies of agency 
records that pertain to him 
 
Generally speaking, governmental records about an individual are prohibited from release. 
The disclosure of these records constitutes an invasion of privacy. A person may obtain 
copies of his own records by requesting them in writing from the agency that maintains 
them. Such requests often are denied, in whole or in part, because of numerous exceptions 
to the disclosure requirements. Some of these exceptions include the pendency of an 
ongoing investigation or concerns about national security. A person denied access to records 
may appeal through that agency or through the courts.  
 
Most records are maintained at the county or local level, a fact that can seriously hamper any 
fraud investigation; it can be very difficult for the fraud examiner to catch up with a 
fraudster who understands the county filing procedures and chooses to operate in different 
counties. However, the following records are available at different levels of government. 
 
The FOIA provides for public access to the following information: 
•  Tax rolls 
•  Voter registration 
•  Assumed names  
•  Real property records 
•  Divorce/probate suits 
 
Information NOT deemed to be public under the FOIA includes: 
•  Banking records 
•  Trust records 
•  Telephone records 
•  Passenger lists 
•  Stock ownership
