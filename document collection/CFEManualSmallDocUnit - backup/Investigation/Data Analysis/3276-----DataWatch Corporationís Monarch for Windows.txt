DataWatch Corporation’s Monarch for Windows 
Monarch is report-mining software. Monarch is unique because it extracts data from existing 
reports created by other programs, and then converts the data into actionable data (e.g., text 
files, spreadsheets, or database tables). For example, electronic data that is retrieved from an 
accounting system, or downloaded from an online source, can be broken down into 
individual records by Monarch’s model. Monarch can read report files produced on any 
mainframe, midrange, client/server, or PC system. These files are commonly known as print 
files, spool files, TXT files, formatted ASCII files, PRN files, and SDF files. Monarch can 
also read DBF files and delimited ASCII files.  
 
Once the data is actionable, it can be analyzed. That is, the records can be manipulated by 
data analysis applications like Access and Excel. 
 
Monarch specializes in reading complex reports in ASCII (plain text) format. Its data mining 
capabilities are useful for data integrity testing. Monarch can be used by itself or in tandem 
with other audit software such as ACL., but it will provide the most benefit when used in 
conjunction with another data analysis tool. 
 
Monarch serves three main functions for investigators: 
• Performs automated auditing tests and tests of various program controls 
• Verifies data on management or exter nal party report-generation accuracy 
• Proactively identifies errors and fraudulent activity 
 
Moreover, examiners can use Monarch to perform several functions in a financial analysis or  
risk assessment: 
• Summary window: To summarize information by a different criteria than the report did 
• Sorting data within the Table window: To generate an alphabetically sorted list or to identify 
the largest or smallest transactions 
• Time series analysis : To compile information from 12 separate reports into a month-by-
 month summary, allowing the investigator to identify trends 
• Graphing data within the Summary window : To graph any information in the Summary 
window into a pie, area, line, or bar chart quickly to visualize composition, trends, or 
distribution (this chart function is much more straightforward than in spreadsheet 
programs, such as MS Excel and Lotus 1-2-3)

• Create calculated fields: To perform custom calculations on ex isting data fields or new fields 
not present in the original file 
 
Here are a few practical examples of Monarch’s investigative capabilities. The software 
allows investigators to: 
• View the 20 largest vendors by invoice am ount to compare the amounts with their 
expectations of those amounts 
• Summarize by purchase order number to determine if the sum of all transactions related 
to a purchase order exceed the amount authorized by the purchase order 
• Measure transaction volume and amount processed by each input clerk to identify 
unusual activity 
• Compare budget versus actual figures by computing a difference field 
• Chart customer delinquency trends for the past 12 months
