Date Functions 
Various software programs allow you to check for differences in dates, such as invoice dates. 
By verifying that check disbursements are consistent, you can ensure that no suspicious 
payments were arranged by an employee. Analysis programs will also allow for aging of data. 
The following is an example of accounts receivable aging.
