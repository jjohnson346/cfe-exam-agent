ABOVE-AVERAGE PAYMENTS TO A VENDOR (MORE THAN TWO TIMES THE AVERAGE) 
Unusually large payments to a vendor in relation to the average are a sign of error (e.g., a 
key-punch error) or fraud (e.g., a kickback scheme in which the vendor is paid additional 
amounts that are kicked-back to the employee entering the payment into the system). 
 
For vendors with unusual payments above the average, a sample of the “average” payment 
invoices, as well as the unusual payment invoices should be reviewed. The reasonableness of 
the purchase should be assessed based on the documentation reviewed. The auditor should 
be keenly aware of the potential for a key-punch error regarding the unusual payment 
and/or the possibility of the vendor purposely overcharging the organization.
