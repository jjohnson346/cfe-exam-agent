Vertical Ratio Analysis 
Vertical analysis is a technique for analyzing the relationships between the items on an 
income statement, balance sheet, or statement of cash flows by expressing components as 
percentages. In the vertical analysis of an income statement, net sales is assigned 100 percent; 
on a balance sheet, total assets or total liabilities and equity is assigned 100 percent. All other 
items are expressed as a percentage of these two numbers.  
 
By performing this function, you can determine whether paid expenditures over a period are 
reasonable amounts. If one area of company expenses seems abnormally large for a short 
amount of time, a red flag should immediately be raised.
