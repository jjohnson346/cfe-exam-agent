Data Analysis 
Once data has been extracted using data mining  techniques, it must be analyzed. While data 
analysis is used mainly as an audit technique, it can be an important part of the fraud 
detection toolkit. Although it cannot be used as evidence that a fraud was committed or that 
a specific individual was involved, it can serve to identify red flags associated with a wide 
variety of frauds. It will thereby provide investigators with a trail to follow.
