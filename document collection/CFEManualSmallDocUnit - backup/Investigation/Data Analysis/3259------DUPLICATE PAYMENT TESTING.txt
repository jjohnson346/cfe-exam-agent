DUPLICATE PAYMENT TESTING  
Duplicate payments to vendors normally represent errors that the computer system was 
unable to detect. In most systems, a check will be made as to whether the vendor number, 
invoice number, and amount are the same. This test could be run to ensure this basic control 
is operational and also to test for other permutations of duplication. Any results from this 
test should be reviewed first for trends. For example, rent payments that occur on a monthly

basis may appear to be duplicate payments when, in fact, they are simply regularly occurring 
payments. Note also that certain accounting packages allow the issuance of partial payments 
(e.g., a payment to the same vendor with the same invoice number and amount). Therefore, 
the auditor should determine whether the system allows such payments and, if so, omit them 
prior to running this application. 
 
Voided checks should also be reviewed; if a payment is made first on a regular check and 
then on a voided one, only one payment was technically made.
