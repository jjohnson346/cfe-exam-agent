VENDOR SUMMARY TOTALS PERIOD ONE TO PERIOD TWO COMPARISON 
This is a basic analytical report to identify trends in a vendor’s purchase history. A trend 
analysis should be completed to identify key vendors with whom activity has increased or 
decreased substantially. This can best be assessed using the dollar and percentage variance 
fields, which can be added as calculated fields in Excel. Based on the changes in the business

environment and/or new company projects, a reasonableness assessment should be 
performed on the vendor changes. 
 
DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS/BENFORD’S LAW ANALYSIS 
Descriptive statistics provide maximum amount, minimum amount, average amount, and 
other high-level statistics. These statistics should be reviewed for reasonableness; for 
example, a high number of negative amounts or a maximum amount that looks too high 
might not be reasonable. 
 
After obtaining the descriptive statistics of a data set, the software provides a Benford’s Law 
analysis of the first two digits of the data, as well as a list of all amounts from highest to 
lowest frequency, for review.  
 
To review, Benford’s Law distinguishes between natural and non-natural numbers. Natural 
numbers  are those numbers that are not ordered in a particular numbering scheme and are not 
generated from a random number system. For example, most accounts payable files will be 
populated by dollar values that are natural numbers. Conversely, non-natural numbers  like 
Social Security numbers and telephone numbers are designed systematically to convey 
information that restricts the natural nature of the number. 
 
Benford’s Law provides that the distribution of the initial digits in natural numbers is not 
random; instead, it follows a predictable pattern. The table below shows the expected 
occurrence for the distribution of the first digit in natural numbers, according to this law: 
 
First Digit Probability
 1 30.1%
 2 17.6%
 3 12.5%
 4 9.7%
 5 7.9%
 6 6.7%
 7 5.8%
 8 5.1%
 9 4.6%
 Total 100.0%

That is, Benford’s Law maintains that certain di gits show up more than others do. A “1” will 
appear as the first non-zero digit roughly 30 percent of the time; “2” will be the leading digit 
almost 18 percent of the time; “9” will lead o ff only 4.6 percent of the time. Moreover, zero 
is most likely to be the second digit, appearing 12 percent of the time.  
 
Benford’s Law makes it possible to detect fraudulent numbers in large data files by 
comparing the frequency of the appearance of initial digits in a list of numbers to those 
anticipated by Benford’s Law. For example, when embezzlers invent numbers, they tend to 
fake data containing too many instances of initial digits of “7,” “8,” and “9” and too few 
instances of “1,” “2,” and “3.” Thus, with Benford’s Law, examiners can tell if someone 
fakes data that are derived from other data, and they can also identify errors within the data 
that appear “out of place” given the data’s frequency of appearance. 
 
The Benford’s Law analysis should be executed first so the most statistical outliers can be 
reviewed.  
 
Furthermore, as a follow up to these tests, examiners should use a Query Sheet to query 
outlier activity for additional review.
