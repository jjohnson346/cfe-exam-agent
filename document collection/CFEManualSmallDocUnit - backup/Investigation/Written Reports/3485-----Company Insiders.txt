Company Insiders 
Managers and executives will probably review reports of cases involving internal fraud and 
misdeeds. Because these documents will likely be reviewed by people outside the company as 
well, they should not address internal control deficiencies, management issues, or other 
sensitive company considerations. Instead, these matters should be dealt with in a separate 
letter or other form of communication.
