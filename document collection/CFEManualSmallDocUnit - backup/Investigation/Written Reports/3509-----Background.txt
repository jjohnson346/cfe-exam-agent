Background 
The background section should generally be about two paragraphs. It should state very 
succinctly why the fraud examination was conducted (e.g., an anonymous tip was received, 
an anomaly was discovered during an audit, money or property was missing). 
 
You may also state who called for the examination and who assembled the examination 
team.
