Intent 
There is no such thing as an accidental fraud or crime. Both require as part of the elements 
of proof the fact that the confessor knew the conduct was wrong and intended to commit 
the act. This can best be accomplished by using precise language in the statement that clearly 
describes the act (e.g., “I wrongfully took assets from the company that weren’t mine” versus “I 
borrowed money from the company without telling anyone ”). 
 
As a general rule, strong emotive words, such as “lie” and “steal,” should be avoided, as the 
confessor might balk at signing the statement. Still, the wording must be precise. Following 
are suggested wordings:
