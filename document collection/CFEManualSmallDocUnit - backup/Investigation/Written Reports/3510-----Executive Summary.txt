Executive Summary 
For a simple fraud examination, the executive summary should be no more than four or five 
paragraphs. For a more complex case, the summary may reach a page or two in length. 
 
In this section, you should also summarize what actions you performed during the fraud 
examination, such as reviewing documents, interviewing witnesses, or conducting analyses or 
tests. It provides the reader with an overview of what you did during the examination 
process. 
 
At the end of this section, you should summarize the outcome of the examination. For 
example, “$50,000 in checks was deposited into an account owned by Bob Wilson. When 
confronted with this information, Wilson stated that he had only borrowed the money and 
meant to pay it back.”
