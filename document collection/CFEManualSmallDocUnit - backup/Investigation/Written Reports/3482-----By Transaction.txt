By Transaction 
If a multitude of documents support several instances of fraud, this information should be 
presented by separating individual transactions. For example, in a case of internal fraud 
involving six different instances of embezzlement, the documents and the related interviews 
might best be understood if presented as a group. Thereafter, detail the remaining 
transactions chronologically.
