Safeguarding and Maintaining Documents 
After obtaining documents, the examiner should secure them for evidence. Be sure that only 
those people with an absolute need for the documents can gain access to them. For practical 
Reporting Standards  Investigation

purposes, it is usually best to copy all documents (original documents are usually not 
included in reports). Mark all original documents in a unique manner, preferably by using 
initials and dates. To avoid defacing originals, use a small but distinctive tick mark or other 
form of identifier. 
 
When documents are voluntarily furnished, leave the originals in place and work with the 
copies. If originals are later lost, stolen, or misplaced, the copies can normally be introduced 
in court under the “best evidence”  rule (see the Law section of the Fraud Examiners Manual ). 
Don’t take shortcuts with evidence, and certainly  do not lose or misplace crucial documents. 
It is inexcusable for a fraud examiner to mishandle evidence; doing so will almost certainly 
compromise the case.
