Advice of Rights 
An Advice of Rights  form effectively “Mirandizes” an individual; that is, it informs a  
person that: 
• He may remain silent in the face of questioning. 
• Whatever the person says can be used against him in a court of law. 
• If he requests, an attorney will be appointed for him before questioning.  
• He may stop answering questions at any time, whether an attorney is present. 
 
If Mirandizing is applicable, this form should be signed and witnessed.
