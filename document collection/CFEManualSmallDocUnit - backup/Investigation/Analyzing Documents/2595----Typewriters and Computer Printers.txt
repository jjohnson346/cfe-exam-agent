Typewriters and Computer Printers 
Typewriting prepared on traditional typebar/segment-shift typewriters, both manual and 
electric, can often be positively identified by experts from mechanical defects unique to each 
machine. Typewritten texts prepared on later-model typewriters equipped with 
interchangeable daisy wheel, ball, or basket-type elements are difficult, if not impossible to 
identify. Computerized dot matrix, ink jet, thermal transfer, or laser (electrostatic) printers 
are rarely identifiable. Usually, the only expert determinations concerning these typewriters 
and printers are that the same typeface design and size (font), letter spacing, and print 
process were used.
