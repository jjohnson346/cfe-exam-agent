Disguise  
Disguise is the conscious, intentional effort by a person to change or conceal his normal 
writings. Disguise is attempted in an effort to prepare writings that can later be disclaimed or 
that the writer hopes will be anonymous and cannot be traced to the source. The success of 
an attempt to disguise writings depends on the writer’s skill and knowledge of writings. Most 
attempts at disguise involve one or more of the following: change in slant, change in size, 
change in shapes of capital (upper-case) letters, changes in the shapes and sizes of loops in 
letters that contain them, use of bizarre letter designs, or block (squared) hand printing. Only 
rarely is the opposite, non-writing hand used. Fraud examiners should be aware that it is 
possible to successfully disguise writings to the point that they cannot be positively 
identified, even by experts.  This is especially true when only limited amounts of writings  
are involved.
