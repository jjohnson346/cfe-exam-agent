Photocopies 
Increasingly, photocopies are retained as “original” records of documents (particularly in 
outgoing correspondence files) and can become the only evidence of a document because 
the original document cannot be located or, in some cases, cannot be released, such as in the 
case of official public records 
 
Fraud examiners and other investigators sometimes submit a copy of a document for 
examination because they do not wish to part with the original. As a result, the document 
examiner will probably not be able to determine features and reach conclusions that could 
have been made from the original document. When at all possible, the fraud examiner 
should obtain the original document for the document examiner and should not submit  
a copy.
