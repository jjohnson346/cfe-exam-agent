Chain of Custody 
From the moment evidence is received, its chain of custody  must be maintained for it to be 
accepted by the court. This means that a record must be made when the item is received or 
when it leaves the care, custody, or control of the fraud examiner. This is best handled by a 
memorandum of interview with the custodian of the records when the evidence is received. 
The memorandum should state: 
• What items were received 
• When they were received 
• From whom they were received 
• Where they are maintained 
 
If the item is later turned over to someone else, a record of this should be made—preferably 
in memorandum form. All evidence received should be uniquely marked so that it can be 
identified later. The preferable way is to initial and date the item; however, this can pose 
problems in the case of original business records furnished voluntarily. For them, a small tick 
mark or other nondescript identifier can be used. If it is not practical to mark the original 
document, it should be placed in a sealed envelope, which should then be initialed and dated.
