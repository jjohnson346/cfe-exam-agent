Types of Evidence 
There are two basic types of admissible evidence: direct or circumstantial. Direct evidence  
shows prima facie the facts at issue; it proves the fact directly. What constitutes direct 
evidence depends on the factors involved. For example, in the Linda Reed Collins case 
involving possible kickbacks, which is included in the Appendix to this section, direct 
evidence might be a check from the vendor to her. 
 
Circumstantial evidence  is that which indirectly shows culpability. In the case of a kickback 
allegation against Collins, cash deposits of unknown origin deposited to her account around 
the time of the suspect transaction could be considered circumstantial evidence.
