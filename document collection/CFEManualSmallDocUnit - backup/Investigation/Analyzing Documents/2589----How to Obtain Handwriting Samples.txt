How to Obtain Handwriting Samples 
Positive results from forensic handwriting examinations and comparisons often depend on 
how well the fraud examiner has assembled adequate handwriting and signature samples of 
the suspects for submission to the forensic expert. The samples must be comparable to the 
writings on the evidence documents. Hand printing cannot be compared with handwriting. 
Capital letters cannot be compared with small letters. The samples must contain the same 
letters and combinations of letters, whether undictated or dictated. For example: “John” 
cannot be compared with “Susan,” “hot” with “c old,” “black” with “white,” or “July” with 
“September.”
