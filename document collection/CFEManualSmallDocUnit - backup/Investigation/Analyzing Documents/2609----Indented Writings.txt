Indented Writings 
Fraud examiners should be alert for the presence of incriminating indented writings, or the 
absence of logical indentations, both of which can be valuable in proving fraud. In some 
situations, documents are routinely kept in multiple-page sets, such as in legal forms, 
multiple-copy invoices, notebooks, tablets, pads, clipboards, and so on. In these situations 
the writings on one sheet should correspond to indentations on the following sheet. The 
absence of corresponding indented writings on the following sheet, or the presence of 
indented writings on one sheet that do not correspond with the text of the writings on the 
preceding sheet, could provide proof that pages have been removed and substituted.
