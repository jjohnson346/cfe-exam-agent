Early Consultation with an Expert Can Prove Valuable 
An expert’s assistance can be of value early in an investigation, not just in preparation for a 
trial. Fraud examiners should consider consulting with experts early in their investigation or 
inquiry if they suspect that significant documents are phony or have been forged, altered, or 
otherwise manipulated. Many times the scope of an investigation can be narrowed or 
directed by eliminating multiple suspects through handwriting examinations. The expert’s 
findings might solidify the fraud examiner’s theories of how the fraud was committed, or 
they can prevent wasted effort by proving theories incorrect at an earlier stage. See the end 
of this section for more information about finding help in document examinations.
