Distortions  
Distortions are unintentional changes to a person’s writings that are beyond his range of 
natural variation. Distortion can be caused by temporary impairment due to illness, injury to 
the writing hand or arm, substance abuse, extreme physical weakness, unusual writing 
environment, irregular or unusual writing surface, or unfamiliar writing materials, or might 
be permanent due to extreme age and feebleness. Fraud examiners should be aware that 
distortions in writings can, on occasion, be so severe that positive identifications of a 
person’s writings might not be possible, even by experts.
