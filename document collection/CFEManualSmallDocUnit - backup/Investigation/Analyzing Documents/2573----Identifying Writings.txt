Identifying Writings 
The development of a person’s handwriting usually begins at an early age as part of his 
formal education. So-called copy-book styles are taught, and the students are instructed 
through exercises to emulate as nearly as possible those letter formations. However, from 
the very beginning, the students’ writing skills vary considerably due to their differing 
physical and mental capabilities. These differences between individuals increase with age; 
physical development; and the acquisition of skills, differing aesthetic values, differences in 
education, and differences in the personal and professional usage of writing. As a result, each 
person’s writings contain a unique and identifiable combination of acquired individual 
personal characteristics and shared “class” characteristics. Forensic document examiners are 
trained and experienced in examining and comparing writings and assessing this combination 
of individual and class characteristics in making expert determinations of identity or  
non-identity.
