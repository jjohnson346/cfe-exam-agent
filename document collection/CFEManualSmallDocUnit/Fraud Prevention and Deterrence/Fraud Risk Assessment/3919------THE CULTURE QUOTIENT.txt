THE CULTURE QUOTIENT  
The Culture Quotient is an assessment of how the organization and its people behave or are 
perceived to behave. The Culture Quotient includes: 
• Tolerance Index — an assessment of the organi zation’s tolerance for bad behavior. An 
organization that has a high tolerance for bad behavior can significantly increase the 
company’s vulnerability to fraud risk.

• Entitlement Index — an assessment that helps determine whether people in the company 
display or promote a sense of entitlement. An organization that sustains a strong sense 
of entitlement from its employees or leaders can have a higher risk of fraud.  
• Notification Index — an assessment of how likely it is that employees will come forward 
when they suspect something is wrong. An organization where there is a low probability 
that employees will come forward is at significantly greater risk of fraud than an 
organization where it is likely that employees will come forward.  
 
Both the Environmental Risk Index and Culture Quotient are elements of the Fraud Risk 
Index that are aimed at identifying and evaluating macro-level indicators of fraud risk that 
the company may be exposed to. The content and approach for performing these parts of 
the assessment should be tailored for the organization under review. 
 
THE PREVENT/DETECT INDEX  
The Prevent/Detect Index assesses the quality of the specific mechanisms that the 
organization has in place to prevent or detect potential fraud, particularly those fraud 
schemes for which the company is at the greatest risk. This component of the assessment 
can be used to identify the company’s greatest fraud risks by pinpointing areas and methods 
that provide opportunities for potential fraudsters to get something—of either real or 
perceived value—out of the business. 
 
To calculate the Prevent/Detect Index, a standard, comprehensive population of fraud 
schemes, such as the ACFE Occupational Fraud Classification System, is used to evaluate 
each scheme that applies to the business and determine which schemes are the high-risk 
schemes that the organization should focus on. For those fraud schemes that apply to the 
company, an evaluation of each scheme should be performed to identify:  
• The likelihood that the scheme could be perpetrated 
• The significance of the fraud risk to the company  
• Whether there are preventive or detective internal controls in place to moderate the risk 
to a sufficient level
