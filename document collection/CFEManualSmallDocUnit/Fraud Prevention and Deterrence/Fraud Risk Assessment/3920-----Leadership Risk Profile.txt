Leadership Risk Profile  
The Leadership Risk Profile is developed to provide a macro-level organizational view of 
which business leaders, if any, increase the organization’s vulnerability to fraud through their:  
• Leadership style 
  
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Fraud Risk Assessment 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.821 
• Operating behaviors 
• Decision-making practices 
 
The fraud risk assessment team should develop or obtain an organizational chart that shows 
the organizational structure of the business and identifies its leaders. The team should then 
develop a profile of each of the leaders and evaluate the fraud risk associated with their 
leadership styles, operating behaviors (including how they interact with their team and 
partners across the business), and decision-making practices.  
 
As part of this evaluation, the team should consider any information that indicates unique 
pressures on or incentives for each leader that could increase the organization’s fraud risk. 
Such pressures and incentives can include, but are not limited to: 
• A significant amount of personal net worth invested in the company 
• A large portion of compensation tied to activities that the leader can manipulate (e.g., 
sales volumes or other business performance measures)  
• A pending divorce 
• Recent organizational changes that have either greatly expanded or reduced/eliminated 
the leader’s span of control 
• Living larger than life 
• Dependence on drugs or alcohol 
• Gambling problems 
 
Note that a comprehensive approach to conducting a fraud risk assessment using this 
framework would include the assessment of both the Fraud Risk Index and the Leadership 
Risk Profile. However, due to the sensitive nature of the Leadership Risk Profile, the 
sponsor may decide to focus the assessment on only the Fraud Risk Index.
