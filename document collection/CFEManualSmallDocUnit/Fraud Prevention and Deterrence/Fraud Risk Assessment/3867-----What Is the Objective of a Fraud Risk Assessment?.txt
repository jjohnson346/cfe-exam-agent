What Is the Objective of a Fraud Risk Assessment?  
In the simplest terms, the objective of a fraud risk assessment is to help an organization 
identify what makes it most vulnerable to fraud. Through a fraud risk assessment, the 
organization is able to identify where fraud is most likely to occur, enabling proactive 
measures to be considered and implemented to reduce the chance that it could happen.
