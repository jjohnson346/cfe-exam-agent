The Ability to Think the Unthinkable  
Most honest people are not naturally inclined to  think like a fraudster. In fact, many large-scale 
frauds that have occurred would have been deemed unthinkable by people closest to 
the events. A good fraud risk assessment has to allow for the people leading and conducting 
the assessment to be expansive in their consideration and evaluation of fraud risk. Thoughts 
of “it can’t happen here” should not be allowed  to moderate the evaluation of fraud risk.
