One Size Does Not Fit All  
Do not try to fit a round peg into a square hole; what works in one organization most likely 
will not easily work in another. Recognizing the nuances and differences of each business 
and tailoring the approach and execution to the specific organization can help make the 
fraud risk assessment successful. While a generic framework or toolset can be a valuable 
starting point for the development of the fraud risk assessment, it must be adapted to fit the 
business model, culture, and language of the organization.
