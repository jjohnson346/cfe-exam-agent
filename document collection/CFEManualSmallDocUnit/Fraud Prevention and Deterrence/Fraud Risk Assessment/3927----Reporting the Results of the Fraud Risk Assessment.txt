Reporting the Results of the Fraud Risk Assessment  
The success of the fraud risk assessment process hinges on how effectively the results are 
reported and what the organization then does with those results. A poorly communicated 
report can undermine the entire process and bring all momentum established to a screeching 
halt. The report should be delivered in a style most suited to the language of the business. If 
management prefers short, punchy PowerPoint presentations, the fraud risk assessment 
team should not give them a 50-page Word document.
