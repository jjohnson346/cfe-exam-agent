Fraud Risk Index  
The following is a suggested framework that has two components: the Fraud Risk Index, 
which looks at indicators of areas that put the organization at risk for fraud, and the 
Leadership Risk Profile, which examines the way business leaders operate to help determine 
if they behave or conduct business in a way that can increase the company’s risk of fraud. 
 
Fraud Risk Index  
The Fraud Risk Index is the overall assessment of fraud risk for the organization based on 
three components: 
• The Environmental Risk Index 
• The Culture Quotient 
• The Prevent/Detect Index
