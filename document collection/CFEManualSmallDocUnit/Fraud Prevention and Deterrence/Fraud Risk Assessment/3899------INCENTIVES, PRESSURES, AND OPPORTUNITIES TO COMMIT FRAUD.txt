INCENTIVES, PRESSURES, AND OPPORTUNITIES TO COMMIT FRAUD  
When assessing incentives, pressures, and opportunities to commit fraud, the fraud risk 
assessment team should evaluate: 
• Incentive programs and how they may affect employees’ behavior when conducting 
business or applying professional judgment 
• Pressures on individuals to achieve performance or other targets and how such pressures 
may influence employees’ behavior 
• Opportunities to commit fraud that arise from weak internal controls, such as a lack of 
segregation of duties
