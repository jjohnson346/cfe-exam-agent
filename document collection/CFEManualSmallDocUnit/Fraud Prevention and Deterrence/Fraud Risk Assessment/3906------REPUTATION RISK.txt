REPUTATION RISK  
The fraud risk assessment team should ensure that consideration of reputation risk is part of 
the organization’s risk assessment process because fraudulent acts can damage an 
organization’s reputation with customers, suppliers, capital markets, and others. For 
example, fraud leading to a financial restatement can damage an organization’s reputation in 
capital markets, which can increase the organization’s cost of borrowing and depress its 
market capitalization.
