Hold Action Owners Accountable for Progress 
It is often said that what gets measured gets done. To effectively reduce identified fraud risk, 
management must hold action owners accountable for making progress and driving impact. 
The organization should track and measure progress against agreed-upon action plans. 
Publicly celebrating the successes of action owners that make good progress can be as or 
more effective in driving the right behaviors as providing consequences for the action 
owners that fail to deliver results.
