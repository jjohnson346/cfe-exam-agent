RISK OF MANAGEMENT’S OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS  
When considering the potential for management’s override of controls, the fraud risk 
assessment team should keep in mind that: 
• Management personnel within the organization generally know the controls and standard 
operating procedures that are in place to prevent fraud. 
• Individuals who are intent on committing fraud may use their knowledge of the 
organization’s controls to do it in a manner that will conceal their actions.
