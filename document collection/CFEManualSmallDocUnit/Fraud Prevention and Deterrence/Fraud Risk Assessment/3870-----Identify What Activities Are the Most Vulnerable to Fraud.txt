Identify What Activities Are the Most Vulnerable to Fraud  
Management must know where the company is most vulnerable to fraud in order to prevent 
it from happening. For most companies, the normal course of business generally involves 
many different activities. However, not all of the activities that the company engages in are 
equal in terms of increasing the business’s exposure to fraud. The fraud risk assessment 
helps guide the organization to focus on the activities that really put the company at greatest 
risk.
