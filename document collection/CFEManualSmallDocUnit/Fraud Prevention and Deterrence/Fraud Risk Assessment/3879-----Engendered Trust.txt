Engendered Trust  
If the organization and its employees do not trust the people leading and conducting the 
fraud risk assessment, they will not be open and honest about the realities of the business, its 
culture, and its vulnerability to fraud. Trust is not something that can be granted by 
authority; it must be earned by words and a ctions. As the people leading and conducting the 
fraud risk assessment engage with business, they should deliberately and carefully plan the 
initial contact with an effort to develop a rapport and gain trust.
