Focus Groups  
Focus groups enable the assessor to observe the interactions of employees as they discuss a 
question or issue. Some topics may lend themselves to being discussed in an open forum in 
which people feel comfortable among their colleagues. Additionally, when discussing tough 
or thorny issues in a group, an anonymous, real-time voting tool can be an effective way of 
opening up a dialogue among the participants.  
 
The success of a focus group will be highly dependent on the skill of the facilitator. If focus 
groups are used as part of the fraud risk assessment, they should be led by an experienced 
facilitator whom the group will relate to and trust. Getting a group to open up and talk 
honestly can be very difficult. An experienced facilitator will be able to read the group and 
use techniques, such as group icebreakers, to make the session a success.
