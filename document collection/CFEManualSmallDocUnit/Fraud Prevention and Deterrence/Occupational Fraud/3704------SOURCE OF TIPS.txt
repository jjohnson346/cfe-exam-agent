SOURCE OF TIPS  
Not surprisingly, employees were the most common source of fraud tips. However, 
customers, vendors, competitors, and acquaintances (i.e., non-company sources) provided at 
least 34% of fraud tips, which suggests that fraud reporting policies and programs should be 
publicized not only to employees, but also to customers, vendors, and other external 
stakeholders. 
 
While tips have consistently been the most common way to detect fraud, the impact of tips 
is, if anything, understated by the fact that so many organizations fail to implement fraud 
reporting systems. Such systems enable employees to anonymously report fraud or 
misconduct by phone or through a web-based portal, otherwise known as hotlines. The 
ability to report fraud anonymously is key because employees often fear making reports due 
to the threat of retaliation from superiors or negative reactions from their peers. Also, most 
third-party hotline systems offer programs to raise awareness about how to report 
misconduct. Consequently, one would expect that the presence of a fraud hotline would 
enhance fraud detection efforts and foster more tips.

one detection method.
