Donald R. Cressey 
During the 1940s at Indiana University, one of Sutherland’s brightest students was Don ald 
R. Cressey (1919–1987). While much of Suther land’s research concentrated on upper-world 
criminality, Cressey took his own studies in a different direction. Working on his Ph.D. in 
criminology, he decided his dissertation would focus on embezzlers. To serve as a basis for 
his research, Cressey interviewed about 200 people who had been incarcerated for 
embezzling funds.
