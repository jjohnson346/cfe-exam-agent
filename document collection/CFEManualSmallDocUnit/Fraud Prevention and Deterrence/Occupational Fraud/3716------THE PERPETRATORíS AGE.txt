THE PERPETRATOR’S AGE 
The distribution of perpetrators based on their age was similar to our 2008 study, but the 
2010 perpetrators tended to be slightly younger. Our past reports have generally shown the 
highest levels of fraud to occur in the 36–5 0 age range, but this year we found more than 
half of all cases were committed by individuals between the ages of 31 and 45. Generally

speaking, median losses tended to rise with the age of the perpetrator, which is consistent 
with our prior research. The most notable difference between 2008 and 2010 is the losses 
caused by perpetrators older than 60. In each study, however, we were dealing with fewer 
than 40 cases in that category. Given the small sample size, we believe this is more likely to 
be an anomaly than an indication of any particular trend.
