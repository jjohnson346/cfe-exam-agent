How Occupational Fraud Is Committed 
Previous ACFE research has identified three primary categories of occupational fraud used 
by individuals to defraud their employers. Asset misappropriations are those schemes in 
which the perpetrator steals or misuses an organization’s resources. These frauds include 
schemes such as skimming cash receipts, falsifying expense reports, and forging company 
checks. 
 
Corruption schemes involve the employee’s use of his influence in business transactions in a 
way that violates his duty to the employer for the purpose of obtaining a benefit for himself 
or someone else. Examples of corruption schemes include bribery, extortion, and a conflict 
of interest.  
 
Financial statement fraud schemes are those involving the intentional misstatement or 
omission of material information in the organization’s financial reports. Common methods 
of fraudulent financial statement manipulation include recording fictitious revenues, 
concealing liabilities or expenses, and artificially inflating reported assets.  
 
As indicated in the following charts, asset misappropriations are by far both the most 
frequent and the least costly form of occupational fraud. On the other end of the spectrum 
are cases involving financial statement fraud. These schemes were present in less than 5% of 
the cases reported to us, but caused a median loss of more than $4 million. Corruption 
schemes fell in the middle category in both respects, occurring in just under one-third of all 
cases involved in our study and causing a median loss of $250,000.

more than one category.
