Conclusions 
Cressey’s classic fraud triangle helps explain the nature of many — but not all—occupational 
offenders. For example, although academicians have tested his model, it has still not fully 
found its way into practice in terms of developing fraud prevention programs. Our sense 
tells us that one model — even Cressey’s — will not fit all situations. Plus, the study is nearly 
half a century old. There has been considerable social change in the interim. And now, many 
anti-fraud professionals believe there is a new breed of occupational offender—one who 
simply lacks a conscience sufficient to overcome temptation.
