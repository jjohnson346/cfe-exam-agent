PERPETRATOR’S CRIMINAL AND EMPLOYMENT HISTORY 
Only 7% of the fraud perpetrators in our study had been previously convicted of a fraud-related 
offense, which was virtually identical to our finding in 2008. Eighty-six percent had 
never been charged with or convicted of a prior offense. The low rate of prior convictions 
suggests that criminal background checks may have some effect in preventing fraud, but the 
effect is probably limited.

In addition to criminal history, past employment issues may indicate that an employee is 
more likely to engage in fraudulent conduct in the future. Of the respondents in our survey, 
791 were able to provide information about the perpetrator’s prior employment history. 
Among those cases, about 8% of perpetrators had been previously punished and 10% had 
been previously terminated for fraud-related conduct.
