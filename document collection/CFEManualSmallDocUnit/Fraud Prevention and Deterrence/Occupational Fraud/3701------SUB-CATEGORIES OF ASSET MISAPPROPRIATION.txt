SUB-CATEGORIES OF ASSET MISAPPROPRIATION 
With nearly 90% of occupational frauds involving some form of asset misappropriation, it is 
instructional to further delineate the methods used by employees to embezzle organizational 
assets. We divided asset misappropriation schemes into nine sub-categories, as illustrated in 
the table below. The first eight sub-categories represent schemes targeting cash; these frauds 
account for approximately 85% of all asset misappropriations. 
 
Two of the sub-schemes — skimming and cash larceny — involve pilfering incoming cash 
receipts, such as sales revenues and accounts receivable collections. The next five sub-categories — 
billing, expense reimbursement, check tampering, payroll, and fraudulent 
register disbursement schemes — involve fraudulent disbursements of cash. The eighth form 
of cash misappropriation targets cash the organization has on hand, such as petty cash funds 
or cash in a vault. The final sub-category of asset misappropriations covers the theft or 
misuse of non-cash assets, including inventory, supplies, fixed assets, investments, 
intellectual property, and proprietary information. The table below provides the frequency 
and median loss associated with each asset misappropriation sub-category.

The sum of percentages in this table exceeds 100% because several cases involved asset misappropriation schemes from more than one category. 
 
As previously mentioned, our 2010 data include fraud cases from countries throughout the 
world, while our 2008 data contain only U.S.-based cases. In the following charts, we isolated 
the U.S. cases from our current study to make a more direct comparison to our 2008 data. 
Interestingly, while financial statement fraud remained the least common and most costly 
form of fraud among U.S. cases, there was a much lower percentage of financial statement 
cases in this study (four percent) as compared to 2008 (ten percent). Additionally, the 
median losses for all three categories of fraud were notably smaller in 2010 than they were in 
2008.
