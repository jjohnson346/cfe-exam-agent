Hypotheses of Employee Theft 
In reviewing the literature on employee theft, Hollinger and Clark concluded that experts 
had developed five separate but interrelated sets of hypotheses of employee theft. The first 
is external economic pressures, such as the “non-shareable financial problem” that Cressey 
described. The second hypothesis was that contemporary employees, specifically young 
ones, are not as hardworking and honest as those in past generations. The third theory, 
advocated primarily by those with years of experience in the security and investigative 
industry, is that every employee can be tempted to steal from his employer. The theory 
basically assumes that people are greedy and dishonest by nature. The fourth theory was 
that job dissatisfaction is the primary cause of employee theft, and the fifth, that theft 
occurs because of the broadly shared formal and informal structure of organizations—that 
is, over time, the group norms, whether good or bad, become the standard of conduct. 
The sum of their research generally concluded that the fourth hypothesis was correct.
