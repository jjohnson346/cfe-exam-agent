The Hollinger-Clark Study 
In 1983, Richard C. Hollinger of Purdue University and John P. Clark of the University of 
Minnesota published federally funded research involving surveys of nearly 10,000 American 
workers. Their book, Theft by Employees, reached a different conclusion than Cressey. They 
concluded that employees steal primarily as a result of workplace conditions, and that the 
true costs of the problem are vastly understated: “In sum, when we take into consideration 
the incalculable social costs... the grand total paid for theft in the workplace is no doubt 
grossly underestimated by the available financial estimates.” 34
