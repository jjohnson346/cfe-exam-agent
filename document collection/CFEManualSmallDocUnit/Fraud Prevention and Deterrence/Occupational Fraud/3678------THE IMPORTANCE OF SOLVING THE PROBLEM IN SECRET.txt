THE IMPORTANCE OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM IN SECRET 
Since Cressey’s study was done in the early 1950s, the workforce was obviously different 
than today’s workforce. But the employee faced  with an immediate, non-shareable financial 
need hasn’t changed much over the years. That employee still must find a way to relieve the 
financial pressure that bears down upon him. Simply stealing money, however, is not 
enough; Cressey found it was crucial that the employee be able to resolve the financial 
problem in secret.  
 
As we have seen, the non-shareable financial problems identified by Cressey all dealt in some 
way with questions of status; the trust violators were afraid of losing the approval of those 
around them and so were unable to tell others about their financial problems. If they could 
not share the fact that they were under financial pressure, it follows that they would not be

able to share the fact that they were resorting to illegal means to relieve that pressure. To do 
so would be to admit that the problems existed in the first place.  
 
The interesting thing to note is that it is not the embezzlement itself that creates the need for 
secrecy in the perpetrator’s mind; it is the circumstances that led to the embezzlement (a 
violation of ascribed obligation, a business reversal, etc.). Cressey said: 
 
“In all cases [in the study] there was a distinct feeling that, because of activity prior to the 
defalcation, the approval of groups important to the trusted person had been lost, or a 
distinct feeling that present gr oup approval would be lost if certain activity were revealed 
[the non-shareable financial problem], with the result that the trusted person was effectively 
isolated from persons who could assist him in solving problems arising from that activity.” 
 
Although the clear conception of a financial problem as non-shareable does not invariably 
result in trust violation, it do es establish in trusted persons a desire for a specific kind of 
solution to their problems. The results desired in the cases encountered were uniform: the 
solution or partial solution of the problem by the use of funds which can be obtained in an 
independent, relatively secret, safe, and sure method in keeping with the ‘rationalizations’ 
available to the person at the time. 5  (emphasis added)
