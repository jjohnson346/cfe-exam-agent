Distribution of Dollar Losses  
Of the 1,843 cases of occupational fraud that comprised our study, 1,822 included the total 
dollar loss. The median loss for all schemes in the study was $160,000. As the following 
chart shows, almost one-fourth of all cases in the 2010 study involved losses of at least $1 
million. The distribution of dollar losses among cases in the 2010 study was similar to the 
distribution in our 2008 Report. In both studies, more than 60% of schemes caused the 
victim organization to suffer a loss of at least $100,000.
