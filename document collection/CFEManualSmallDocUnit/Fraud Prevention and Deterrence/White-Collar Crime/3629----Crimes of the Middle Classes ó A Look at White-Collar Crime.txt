Crimes of the Middle Classes — A Look at White-Collar Crime 
Surveys carried out subsequently provide essentially the same result—that the public as a 
whole regards some white-collar offenses as serious matters. The difficulty with such 
surveys, however, is that they fail to convey in any effective manner the complexity of the 
white-collar offenses and the status of the offenders. It is one thing for a respondent to say 
that he regards toxic waste offenses that produce death as very serious violations, but quite 
another for that person to regard the corporate executive responsible for such matters as an 
“evil” person. Because of this, white-collar offe nders receive much less severe penalties than 
the street people who commit the offenses that the public generally regards to be as serious 
as theirs. 
 
The debate over just what constitutes a white-collar crime, and what drives the white-collar 
criminal, has been raging ever since Sutherland’s seminal work. The authors of Crimes of the 
White-Collar Crime  Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
4.406   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
Middle Classes3 offer a contribution that for the most part avoids theory-building, offering 
instead a statistical report of offenders convicted in federal court. 
 
Using federal court records, and an unprecedented access to probation officers’ 
presentencing investigation reports (PSIs), the authors determined that most people 
convicted of white-collar crimes are not upper class; that social status has only an indirect 
significance; and that, once a conviction is attained, higher status often means a stiffer 
sentence. The most important factor is “how personal situations and organizational 
opportunities combine” to make crime possible and attractive to average Americans. 4 White-
 collar crime does have a unique place in criminology, but the split is not between an 
underworld of the desperate poor and an elite universe of high-stakes shysters. White-collar 
crime has some relation to both of these mythological worlds, but is largely the province of 
the middle classes, where organizational position is more important than pedigree and 
personal situations are more forceful than sociological trends.
