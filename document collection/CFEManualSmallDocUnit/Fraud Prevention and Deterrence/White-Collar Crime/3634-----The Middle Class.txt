The Middle Class 
People of moderate social standing are in fact more likely than members of the upper class 
to commit highly organized crimes from within a corporate structure.9 Some offenders do fit 
the stereotype of “respectability and high social status” in white-collar crime, but most of 
them are solidly middle class. “They appear to represent the very broad middle of the 
society, much above the poverty line but for the most part far from elite social status,” the 
authors say. Offenders “are mostly commonplace, not unlike the average American in most 
respects, though perhaps more often with personal lives that are in some state of disarray. 
The single quality that distinguishes them from other Americans is that they have been 
convicted of a federal crime.” 10
