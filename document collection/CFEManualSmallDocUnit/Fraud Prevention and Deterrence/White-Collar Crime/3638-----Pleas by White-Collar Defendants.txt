Pleas by White-Collar Defendants 
White-collar defendants are more likely to insist on a trial than other offenders. In at least 90 
percent of federal cases, defendants will plead guilty, avoiding the expense and effort of a 
trial. But, over 18 percent of defendants in the Crimes sample (as opposed to the usual ten 
percent) pled “Not Guilty.” In cases like bank embezzlement, usually “simple cases with 
clear evidence,” plea bargains are easily negotiated and “prosecutors may actively seek guilty 
pleas.” 14 The decision on how to plead varies with the offender as much as the offense. For 
example, female bank tellers were especially prone to plead “Not Guilty,” while many of the 
male embezzlers—generally “higher-level officials involved in more complex crimes”—
 proceeded to trial. Of all white-collar defendants, securities offenders are the ones most 
likely to insist on their day in court. Evidently, both the government and the defendants in 
these cases feel more strongly about their chances to win.
