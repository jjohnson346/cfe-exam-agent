Parole  
Parole (derived from the French and meaning “word,” as in “word of honor”) is the planned 
release and community supervision of offenders before the expiration of their sentence. 
Under most state laws, an offender is eligible for parole after serving one-third of his 
sentence. Parole decisions usually are made by a board or a commission, based on its 
members’ conclusion regarding whether the offe nder will remain at liberty without violating 
the law. There is pressure on parole board members to be notably conservative in their 
actions, because any repetition of an offense by someone they release, particularly if the 
offense is heinous, will trigger community outrage against the board. On the other hand, 
overcrowded prison conditions dictate early release to make room for newcomers. 
 
Parole is considered an act of grace, and once on parole, the inmate is supposed to be  
closely supervised by a parole officer, though this rarely happens because of extraordinarily 
heavy caseloads.
