Indeterminate Sentences 
Indeterminate sentences impose a range of time that can be served by the offender, say five to 
twenty years. This gap allows the correctional authorities to determine when to release the 
prisoner based upon his performance within the institution and an assessment of the 
likelihood that he will continue to pose a danger to the community. Once the most popular 
form of sentencing because it was believed that prison officials possessed the skill and 
wisdom to make accurate judgments about re-offending, indeterminate sentences have come 
into disrepute during the past decades. The objections largely have focused on the inequities 
involved—two people committing the same offense often served vastly different prison 
terms. In addition, prison authorities were deemed to use the indeterminate sentence unfairly 
to take revenge on people they did not like, as a punitive weapon rather than as a  
predictive device.4
