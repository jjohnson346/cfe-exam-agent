Sentencing Options 
There are a variety of sanctions available to the judge and, when they are charged with 
imposing sentences, the jury as well. Among others, there is pre-trial diversion, probation, 
and incapacitation or incarceration. If the sentence is imprisonment, it may be made under 
rules that dictate a determinate sentence (such as five years) or an indeterminate sentence 
(such as five to ten years). There are some offenses where the sentence is mandatory and 
dictated by a set of guidelines that typically allow for a decrease or increase of the stipulated 
amount of time to be served if certain other circumstances are present (for instance, whether 
the offender was armed). 
 
Sentencing of white-collar offenders is often complicated by the fact that, while their 
behavior may have been notably harmful, this most likely will be their first criminal offense. 
They also typically come to court with an unblemished record of social accomplishments: 
church participation, seemingly strong family ties, and an array of civil achievements. These 
kinds of credentials work in offenders’ favor when it comes time to impose a sentence upon 
them. Studies of white-collar crime also point out that judges and defendants in such cases 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Punishment and the Criminal Justice System 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    4.303  
often share similar social and educational backgrounds, creating a certain empathy in the 
sentence. Note, for instance, the sentencing memorandum filed on behalf of a client who 
had committed an egregious income tax violation: 
 
In short, the court must pass sentence upon  a man with an unblemished record, whose 
character is one of the highest and whose achievements have been truly outstanding. It is 
submitted that nothing in this record suggests that [the defendant] needs prison 
rehabilitation or that he is ever likely again to break the law. In considering only this man 
as a human being, it is submitted that a prison sentence is unwarranted. The record for 
total good during a life span of 44 years weig hs heavily against the isolated transgression of 
the evasions of taxes. 1
