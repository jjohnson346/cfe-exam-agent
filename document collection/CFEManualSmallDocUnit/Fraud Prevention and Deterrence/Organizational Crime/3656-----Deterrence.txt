Deterrence 
As a strategy to control crime, deterrence  is designed to detect law violations, determine who is 
responsible, and penalize offenders in order to deter future violations. Deterrence systems 
try to control the immediate behavior of individuals, not the long-term behaviors targeted by 
compliance systems.  
 
Deterrence theory assumes that humans are rational in their behavior patterns. Humans seek 
profit and pleasure while they try to avoid pain. Deterrence assumes that an individual’s 
propensity toward lawbreaking is in inverse proportion to the perceived probability of 
negative consequences.
