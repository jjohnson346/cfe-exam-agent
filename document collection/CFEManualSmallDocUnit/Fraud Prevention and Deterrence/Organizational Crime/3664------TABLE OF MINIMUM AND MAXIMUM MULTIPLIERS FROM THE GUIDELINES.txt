TABLE OF MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM MULTIPLIERS FROM THE GUIDELINES 
The organization’s fine is multiplied by the minimum and maximum multipliers for its 
culpability score to determine the possible range of fines.

Assuming an organization had been fined $1 00,000, its culpability score could have a 
tremendous impact. If the organization’s culpability score was zero as a result of self-reporting 
and having an effective compliance program in place, that organization’s fine range 
would be between $5,000 and $20,000. (Determined by multiplying $100,000 by .05 and .20, 
respectively.) On the other hand, if the presence of aggravating factors had left the 
organization with a culpability score of ten, its fine range would be $200,000 to $400,000. 
Thus, in the case of a $100,000 base fine, there is a potential swing of $395,000 in the fine 
the organization will have to pay.
