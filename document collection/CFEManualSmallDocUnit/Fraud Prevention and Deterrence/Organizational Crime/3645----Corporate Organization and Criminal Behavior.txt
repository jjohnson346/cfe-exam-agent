Corporate Organization and Criminal Behavior 
Corporate offenses take place in a context of complex relationships and expectations in an 
organizational setting. It is often difficult to distinguish which corporate participants ought 
to be held personally responsible for the wrongdoing. Many offenses are the result of myriad 
decisions that are made by different individuals and passed through a chain of command. 
Not uncommonly, when corporate acts are contrary to the law, upper-level executives take 
pains to avoid learning what is going on so as to avoid responsibility if a scheme is 
uncovered. In some corporations, there is one well-paid executive who is only half in jest 
referred to as the “vice president in charge of going to jail.” 
 
The law largely treats corporations as people. They make more inviting prosecutory targets 
than individuals, most notably because they have deeper pockets and can be heavily fined to 
repay losses that have been inflicted on individuals or on the society in general.  
 
Government regulatory agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
oversee corporate performance in areas assigned to them by Congressional mandate. 
Typically, the lawmakers enact a statute that is deliberately vague, allowing the enforcement 
agency to develop its own enforcement guidelines within the boundaries of the 
Congressional authorization. The agencies will sometimes seek to expand the reach of the 
law by selecting notably egregious cases for litigation and appeal, thereby anticipating a 
favorable ruling on what is fundamentally a somewhat novel interpretation of their mandate.
