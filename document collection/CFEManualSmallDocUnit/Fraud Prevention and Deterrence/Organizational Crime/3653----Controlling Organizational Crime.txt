Controlling Organizational Crime 
Clinard and Yeager believe corporations that do violate acceptable conduct and those that 
do not are distinguished by “corporate cultures” or ethical climates, which are the degree to 
which a corporation has made the choice to be unethical, to disregard the interests of the 
consumer and the public, and to disobey the laws that regulate its specific industry. 
 
Efforts to control corporate crime follow three approaches: voluntary change in corporate 
attitudes and structure; strong intervention of the political state to force changes in corporate 
structure, accompanied by legal measures to deter or punish; or consumer action. Voluntary 
changes would involve the development of stronger business ethics and certain corporate 
organizational reforms; government controls might involve federal corporate chartering, 
deconcentration and divesture, larger and more effective enforcement staffs, stiffer penalties, 
wider use of publicity as a sanction, and possibly the nationalization of corporations; and 
consumer group pressures may be exerted through lobbying, selective buying, boycotts, and 
the establishment of large consumer cooperatives. 
 
Clinard and Yeager suggest that a wide, comprehensive industrial code of ethics, which many 
businessmen favor, would be of great help when a businessman wished to refuse an 
unethical request, would help define more clearly the limits of acceptable or ethical conduct, 
would improve the ethical climate of the industry, and would serve to reduce cutthroat 
practices where competition is intense. Greater stockholder involvement might enable 
greater corporate compliance with the law, but in actuality, it is the management staff that 
runs the company and makes the decisions; the stockholders are primarily concerned with 
stock growth and dividends. 
 
In some cases, critical information dealing with possible law violations simply fails to reach 
the board of directors. New board members are usually nominated by the board and 
routinely approved by stockholders, making boards self-perpetuating. Board members are 
Organizational Crime  Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
4.514   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
often drawn from management. Many corporations now employ outside directors and/or 
representatives of the public interest, much like the practice abroad of naming union 
representatives to boards. These public members represent the public and consumer 
concerns, ascertain whether the corporation is complying with the law, assist and maintain 
corporate public responsibility, help monitor the internal management system to discover 
faulty workmanship and report it to the board, serve as liaisons with government agencies 
with respect to legislation or standards, and serve as a hotline to receive information  
about deviance. 
 
Clinard and Yeager found that mass media publicity about law violations probably represents 
the most feared consequence of sanctions imposed on a corporation. Publicity can also 
inform the public about the operation of regulatory controls and can enable people to 
understand the purposes of the controls. Informal publicity is ordinarily carried as news 
items from the media, while formal publicity is a requirement that a corporation must, as 
part of an enforcement action, publish an advertisement or some other statement 
acknowledging a violation and that corrective measures are being taken. 
 
If illegal behavior consistently resulted in decreased patronage or even consumer boycotts, 
consumer pressure would be an effective tool in the control of illegal corporate behavior. 
However, say Clinard and Yeager, it appears to  not be very effective. Consumers are often 
unaware when a corporation’s products are unsafe or when it has been violating anti-trust 
laws or polluting the environment. Without organized behavior, a consumer’s withdrawal of 
individual patronage is generally ineffective.   
 
Many corporations settle charges, without admitting or denying guilt, by consenting to either 
an administrative or a court-ordered decree banning future violations. In a consent 
agreement, the corporation reaches an understanding with the government agency not to 
violate the regulation again. In a decree, the agreement is ratified by the court. 
 
Sporkin says consent decrees have enabled the appointment of special officers to investigate 
and pursue claims against erring managements and others on behalf of the corporation and 
its shareholders, the placement of people independent of management and not previously 
associated with the company or the board of directors, and the appointment of special 
review or audit committees. A problem with consent orders, however, is that frequently no 
one follows up to find out whether the terms imposed are being met.

Violations of a consent order can be followed  by an injunction, as can distribution of 
adulterated, contaminated, or mislabeled products. Corporate violations of Securities and 
Exchange Act provisions can result in injunctions, as well as discriminatory labor practices, 
illegal economic actions, environmental pollution, and illegal political contributions. 
 
Criminal fines and civil and administrative penalties against corporations are forms of 
monetary penalties. For completion, criminal cases average about one year from indictment 
to conviction, civil actions about two years, and administrative cases about four months. 
Criminal action against corporations is difficult to initiate because generally government 
agencies are dependent upon the records of the corporation and its ability or willingness to 
furnish needed information.  
 
Not all experts agree that monetary penalties are appropriate. For example, a $25 million fine 
to a pauper would have no effect. One novel approach to punishing corporations was 
proposed by Coffee (1978). He advocates stock dilution or “equity fining.” Under this 
approach, the convicted corporation would issue additional shares of stock to the state equal 
to the cash value of a fine. The state could collect the equity shares and sell them, trade 
them, or keep them for their earnings power. With respect to monetary penalties, some 
argue that these sanctions are limited to a person’s own worth and therefore have limited 
utility. In 1992, Congress implemented the corporate sentencing guidelines, providing up to 
$290 million in fines for illegal corporate behavior.  
 
Some of the criteria considered when deciding to bring criminal action against a corporation 
are the degree of loss to the public, the duration of the violation, the level of complicity by 
high corporate managers, the frequency of the violation, evidence of intent to violate, 
evidence of extortion, the degree of notoriety endangered by the media, precedent in law, a 
history of serious violations by the corporation, deterrence potential, and the degree of 
cooperation demonstrated by the corporation. 
 
Rules governing industry often have been initiated by parts of the industry itself. Kolko says 
that a major achievement for corporations may have been the establishment of the Federal 
Trade Commission, which ruled out “unfair methods of competition” and served to stabilize 
the competitive game by making the biggest abuses of competition illegal.  
 
Stone says that as they age, almost all agencies show evidence of protecting the industries 
they are supposed to regulate rather than the public. Industries also gain influence over

agencies by creating a business-oriented atmosphere between regulators and regulatees that 
may cause the regulators to feel unwarranted confidence in the possibility of voluntary 
compliance by corporations.
