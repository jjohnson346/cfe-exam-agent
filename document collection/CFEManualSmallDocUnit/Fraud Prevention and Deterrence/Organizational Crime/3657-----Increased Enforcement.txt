Increased Enforcement 
Formal levels of current enforcement in white-collar crime are, by all measures, extremely 
low. One view holds that increased enforcement can only come with a complete and total 
revision of the criminal justice system. Currently, people have little fear of detection because 
they know that the police and courts cannot keep up with the pace of criminal offenses. It is 
not necessary or even desirable to advocate longer prison sentences for offenders because 
we do not have the courts and jails to accommodate them. Perhaps a better plan would be to 
sacrifice the severity of punishment for certainty. Until potential offenders have the 
perception that they will be caught and punished, we cannot expect a reversal of the  
crime trend.
