Social Structure Theories 
These theories concentrate on the kinds of societies that generate particular levels of crime. 
Why is crime so low in Japan and so high in the United States? Why do South American 
countries typically have high rates of homicide while England’s homicide rate is relatively 
low? There are various kinds of sociological theories, all based on similar premises but with 
differing emphases. 
 
As a group, social structure theories suggest that forces operating in the lower-class areas of 
the environment push many of their residents into criminal behavior. Social structure 
theorists challenge those who would suggest that crime is an expression of psychological 
imbalance, biological traits, personal choice, etc. They argue that people living in equivalent 
social environments seem to behave in a similar, predictable fashion.
