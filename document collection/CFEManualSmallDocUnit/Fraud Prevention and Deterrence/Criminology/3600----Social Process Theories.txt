Social Process Theories 
Not all sociologists believe that a person’s social structure alone controls the direction of his 
values, attitudes, and behavior. After all, most people who reside in even the most 
deteriorated urban areas are law-abiding citizens. Social process theories hold that criminality is a 
function of individual socialization and the social-psychological interactions people have 
with the various organizations, institutions, and processes of society. 
 
Though they differ in many respects, the various social process theories all share one basic 
concept: all people, regardless of their race, cl ass, or gender, have the potential to become 
delinquents or criminals.
