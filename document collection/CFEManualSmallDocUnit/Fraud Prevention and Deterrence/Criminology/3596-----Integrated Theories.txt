Integrated Theories 
Integrated theories  draw from choice theory, biological theory, and psychological theory. One 
such argument is put forward by James Q. Wilson and Richard J. Herrnstein in their book 
Crime and Human Nature. Wilson and Herrnstein maintain that while criminal activity is a 
choice, this choice is heavily influenced by biological and psychological factors. They also 
explore social factors. The factors include family life, schools, and gang membership.
