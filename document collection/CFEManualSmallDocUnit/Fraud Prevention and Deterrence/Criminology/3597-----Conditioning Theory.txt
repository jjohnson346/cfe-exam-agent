Conditioning Theory 
H. J. Eysenck, working with what he calls conditioning theory, argues that the failure of a person 
to incorporate satisfactorily the dictates of society represents the major explanation for 
subsequent criminal behavior. Eysenck maintains that extroverted persons, both normal and 
neurotic, are more difficult to condition — that is, to train—than introverted persons, and 
that extroverts therefore get into more trouble than introverts. 
 
Another psychological theme is that frustration is the precursor of aggression. The theory 
suggests that the expression of aggression, such as a fraud perpetrator “getting back” at his 
employer, will alleviate the frustration and allow the organism to return to a more 
satisfactory state.
