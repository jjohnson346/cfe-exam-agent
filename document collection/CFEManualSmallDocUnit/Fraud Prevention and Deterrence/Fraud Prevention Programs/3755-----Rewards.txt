Rewards 
Some companies have a policy of rewarding information that leads to the recovery of 
merchandise, property, or money. Others offer rewards upon the criminal conviction of the 
person(s) involved. If a reward policy exists, strict criteria should establish reward payments, 
and such proposed policies should be reviewed and approved by counsel. The amount of 
reward paid by companies varies from fixed fees to a percentage of the recovery. Studies 
indicate that rewards should not exceed a few thousand dollars.
