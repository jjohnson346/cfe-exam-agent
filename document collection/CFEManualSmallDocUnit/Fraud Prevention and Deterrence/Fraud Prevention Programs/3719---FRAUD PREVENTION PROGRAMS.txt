FRAUD PREVENTION PROGRAMS 
 
Fraud prevention requires a system of rules, which, in their aggregate, minimize the 
likelihood of fraud occurring while maximizing the possibility of detecting any fraudulent 
activity that may transpire. The potential of being caught most often persuades likely 
perpetrators not to commit the fraud. Because of this principle, the existence of a thorough 
control system is essential to fraud prevention.
