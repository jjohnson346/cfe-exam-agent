Fair Competition 
The company supports competition based on quality, service, and price. We will conduct our 
affairs honestly, directly, and fairly. To comply with the anti-trust laws and our policy of fair 
competition, employees: 
• Must never discuss with competitors any matter directly involved in competition 
between us and the competitor (e.g., sales price, marketing strategies, market shares, and 
sales policies) 
• Must never agree with a competitor to restrict competition by fixing prices, allocating 
markets, or other means 
• Must not arbitrarily refuse to deal with or  purchase goods and services from others 
simply because they are competitors in other respects 
• Must not require others to buy from us before we will buy from them 
• Must not require customers to take from us a service they don’t want just so they can get 
one they do want 
• Must never engage in industrial  espionage or commercial bribery
