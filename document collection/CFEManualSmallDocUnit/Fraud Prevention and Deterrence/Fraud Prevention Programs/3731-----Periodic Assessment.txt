Periodic Assessment 
The Guidelines also require that the organization periodically assess the risk that criminal 
conduct will occur and modify its actions and its compliance and ethics program accordingly. In 
doing so, the organization should assess the following: 
• The nature and seriousness of criminal conduct that could occur 
• The likelihood that certain criminal conduct may occur because of the nature of the 
organization’s business 
• The prior history of the organization, which may indicate the types of criminal conduct 
that the company should be trying to prevent 
 
Moreover, the proposed amendments add an Application Note that clarifies the requirement 
that organizations conduct periodic assessments. The Note provides that an organization, as 
part of a periodic assessment, should monitor “the nature and operations of the organization 
with regard to particular ethics and compliance functions.” 2
