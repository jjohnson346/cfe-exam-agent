Certification Obligations 
As part of an effort to eliminate financial statement fraud, Sarbanes-Oxley requires CEOs 
and CFOs of publicly traded companies to personally certify their companies’ annual and 
quarterly SEC filings. There are two categories of officer certifications required by SOX: 
criminal certifications, which are contained in Section 906 of the Act, and civil certifications, 
which are contained in Section 302.
