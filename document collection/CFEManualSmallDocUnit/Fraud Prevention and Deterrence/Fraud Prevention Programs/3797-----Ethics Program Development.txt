Ethics Program Development 
Identifying key organizational characteristics and issues is a start to the development of an 
ethics program. These items include: 
• Understanding of why good people can commit unethical acts 
• Defining current—as well as desired—organizational values 
• Determining if organizational values have been properly communicated 
• Producing written ethics policies, procedures, or structures 
• Ascertaining how board members, stockholders, management, employees, and any other 
pertinent members of the organization define success 
• Determining if ethics is a leadership issue in the organization 
 
With a good understanding of the above-mentioned issues, a more effective ethics program 
can be built. The following 12 components are necessary to develop, implement, and 
manage a comprehensive ethics program: 
• Focus on ethical leadership 
• Vision statement 
• Values statement 
• Code of ethics 
• Designated ethics official 
• Ethics task force or committee
