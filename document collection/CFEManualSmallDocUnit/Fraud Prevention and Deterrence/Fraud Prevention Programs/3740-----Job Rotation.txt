Job Rotation 
Some frauds are detected during sickness or unexpected absences of the perpetrator because 
they require continuous, manual intervention. 
 
EXAMPLE  
A manager who embezzled $1.6 million from  his company said, “If the company had 
coupled a two-week vacation with four weeks of rotation to another job function, my 
embezzlement would have been impossible to cover up.” His fraud lasted three years.
