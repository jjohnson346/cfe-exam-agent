Company Assets and Transactions 
Compliance with prescribed accounting procedures is required at all times. Employees 
having control over company assets and transactions are expected to handle them with the 
strictest integrity and ensure that all transactions are executed in accordance with 
management’s authorization. All transactions shall be accurately and fairly recorded in 
reasonable detail in the company’s accounting records.  
 
Employees are personally accountable for company funds over which they have control. 
Employees who spend company funds should ensure that the company receives good value 
in return and must maintain accurate records of such expenditures. Employees who approve 
or certify the correctness of a bill or voucher should know that the purchase and amount are 
proper and correct. Obtaining or creating “false” invoices or other misleading 
documentation or the invention or use of fictitious sales, purchases, services, loans, entities, 
or other financial arrangements is prohibited.  
 
Employees must pay for personal telephone calls and use, except to the extent that 
specifically defined benefit programs or allowances otherwise provide.
