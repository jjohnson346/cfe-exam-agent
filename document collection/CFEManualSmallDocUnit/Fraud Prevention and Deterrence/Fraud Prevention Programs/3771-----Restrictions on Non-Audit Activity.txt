Restrictions on Non-Audit Activity 
In order to address concerns about potential conflicts of interest that can arise when public 
accounting firms receive consulting fees and other compensation for non-audit services 
from their audit clients, Sarbanes-Oxley established a list of activities that public accounting 
firms are now prohibited from performing on behalf of their audit clients. The list includes 
most consulting and expert services, although tax services are still permissible if they are 
approved in advance by the audit committee.
