Orientation/Annual Training 
During initial employee orientation, the fraud policy should be discussed. This is the first 
opportunity the company has to make its point, and it should be made thoroughly. 
Reminding employees via annual online or live training may reinforce the policy and 
management’s expectations that it be followed.
