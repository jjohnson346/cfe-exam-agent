IMPACT OF CERTIFICATION OBLIGATIONS 
Sarbanes-Oxley requires CEOs and CFOs to  take personal responsibility for their 
companies’ financial statements; they cannot  delegate their responsibilities to their 
subordinates and then claim ignorance when fraud is discovered. If the financials include 
fraudulent reporting, then the senior financial officers may be held individually civilly liable 
for the misstatements.  
 
The “fairly presents” standard of item 3 is broader than what is required by GAAP. It 
essentially requires the CEO and CFO to certi fy that the company has selected appropriate 
accounting policies; has properly applied those accounting standards; and has disclosed 
financial information that reflects the underlying transactions of the company.  
 
Item 4 requires senior financial officers to take an active role in the design and maintenance 
of their companies’ internal controls. It not only requires the CEO and CFO to certify that 
they are responsible for controls, but also that they have evaluated their controls within 90 
days prior to their quarterly or annual report. This effectively requires companies to 
continually re-evaluate their control structures. Item 5 requires the CEO and CFO to report 
any material weaknesses in their company’s controls, along with any fraud involving 
management, whether it is material or not.

The overall effect of these certification requirements is to force CEOs and CFOs to take an 
active role in the anti-fraud efforts of their companies, making internal controls and fraud 
prevention a high priority.
