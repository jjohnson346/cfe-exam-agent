Vicarious or Imputed Liability 
Corporations and other organizations can be held liable for criminal acts committed as a 
matter of organizational policy. Fortunately, most organizations do not expressly set out to 
break the law. However, corporations and other organizations may also be held liable for the 
criminal acts of their employees if those acts are done in the course and scope of their employment 
and for the ostensible purpose of benefiting the corporation. An employee’s acts are considered to be 
in the course and scope of employment if the employee has actual authority  or apparent authority  
to engage in those acts. Apparent authority means that a third party would reasonably believe 
the employee is authorized to perform the act on behalf of the company. Therefore, an 
organization could be held liable for something an employee does on behalf of the 
organization even if the employee is not authorized to perform that act.  
 
An organization will not be vicariously liable for the acts of an employee unless the 
employee acted for the ostensible purpose of benefiting the corporation. This does not mean 
the corporation has to receive an actual benefit from the illegal acts of its employee. All that 
is required is that the employee intended  to benefit the corporation. 
 
A company cannot seek to avoid vicarious liability for the acts of its employees by simply 
claiming that it did not know what was going on. Legally speaking, an organization is 
deemed to have knowledge of all facts known by its officers and employees. That is, if the 
government can prove that an officer or employee knew of conduct that raised a question as 
to the company’s liability, and the government ca n show that the company willfully failed to 
act to correct the situation, then the company may be held liable, even if senior management 
had no knowledge or suspicion of the wrongdoing.

In addition, the evolving legal principle of “conscious avoidance” allows the government to 
prove the employer had knowledge of a particular fact, which establishes liability by showing 
that the employer knew there was a high probability the fact existed and consciously avoided 
confirming the fact. Employers cannot simply turn a blind eye when there is reason to 
believe that there may be criminal conduct within the organization. If steps are not taken to 
deter the activity, the company itself may be found liable.  
 
The corporation can be held criminally responsible even if those in management had no knowledge or 
participation  in the underlying criminal events and even if there were specific policies or 
instructions prohibiting the activity undertaken by the employees. The acts of any employee, 
from the lowest clerk to the CEO, can impute liability upon a corporation. In fact, a 
corporation can be criminally responsible for the collective knowledge  of several of its employees 
even if no single employee intended to commit an offense. Thus, the combination of vicarious 
or imputed corporate criminal liability and the Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations creates 
an extraordinary risk for corporations today.
