GIFTS  
No employee or member of his immediate family shall solicit or accept from an actual or 
prospective customer or supplier any compensation, advance loans (except from established

favors that are of more than token value or that the employee would not normally be in a

Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Fraud Prevention Programs 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.757 
Under no circumstances should a gift or entertainment be accepted that would influence the 
employee’s judgment. In particular, employees must avoid any interest in or benefit from any 
supplier that could reasonably cause them to favor that supplier over others. It is a violation 
of the code for any employee to solicit or encourage a supplier to give any item or service to 
the employee regardless of its value, no matter how small. Our suppliers will retain their 
confidence in the objectivity and integrity of our company only if each employee strictly 
observes this guideline.
