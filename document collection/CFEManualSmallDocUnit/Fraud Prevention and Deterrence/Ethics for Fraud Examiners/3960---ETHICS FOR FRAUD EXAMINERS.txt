ETHICS FOR FRAUD EXAMINERS 
 
In this section, we have discussed a number of behavioral and ethical principles applicable to 
both organizations and individuals. As a fraud examiner, the decisions you make will be 
extremely important to your client or company as well as to the individuals you may be 
called upon to investigate. Therefore, Certified Fraud Examiners are held to a very high 
ethical standard. The following material is designed to accomplish more than a mere 
recitation of rules of professional ethics for fraud examiners. It also contains discussion and 
explanation of many features of ethics in general. The first portion deals with principles of 
moral philosophy. These represent the “high road” in the study of ethics for fraud 
examiners. The latter portion deals more specifically with rules of behavior in situations that 
characterize fraud examiners’ work. The applications of the Certified Fraud Examiner Code 
of Professional Ethics are discussed.
