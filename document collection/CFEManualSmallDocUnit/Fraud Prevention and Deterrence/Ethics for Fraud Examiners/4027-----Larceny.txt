Larceny 
Larceny  includes obtaining possession of property by fraud, trick, or device with a 
preconceived design or intent to appropriate, convert, or steal. 
 
For larceny and theft, if there is any indication or pattern that property is missing, it is 
important that the Certified Fraud Examiner review the situation to determine if a full- scale 
investigation is warranted.
