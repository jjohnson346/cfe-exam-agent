Predication Standards 
Knowing when to initiate an examination will largely be driven by the source of the 
information. Information can be derived from a number of sources — a complaint, an 
anonymous tip, by accident, or through some proactive effort, such as an audit or survey. 
The value of the information has to be weighed and the creditability evaluated.  
 
The purpose of a preliminary inquiry is to determine if there is some creditable information 
that a fraudulent act has or will occur (a red flag). If so, what is the examiner’s responsibility?  
 
Preliminary inquiries should be conducted expeditiously and not used as a means of holding 
in abeyance a decision of initiating a formal fraud examination. If a sufficient number of 
fraud indicators exist, a fraud examination should be initiated. 
 
Because business activities/transactions are susceptible to fraudulent acts, all examinations 
should be approached with professional skepticism. That is, assume neither dishonesty nor 
unquestioned honesty of management/personnel.
