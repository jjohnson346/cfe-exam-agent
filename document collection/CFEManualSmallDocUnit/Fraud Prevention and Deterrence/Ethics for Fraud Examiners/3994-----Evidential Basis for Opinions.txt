Evidential Basis for Opinions   
 
A fraud examiner, in conducting examinations, will obtain evidence or other 
documentation to establish a reasonable basis for any opinion render ed. No opinion shall 
be expressed regarding the guilt or innocence of any person or party.  
 
Evidential Basis for Opinions 
The accounting profession has similar rules, some of which are in its codes of ethics, some 
in its technical practice standards. Here is a sample of its provisions:  
 
Sufficient competent evidential matter is to be obtained through in spection, observation, 
inquiries and confirmations to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion regarding the 
financial statements under examination. [AICPA Generally Accepted Auditing 
Standards] 
 
Internal auditors should collect, analyze, inte rpret, and document information to support 
audit results. [The Institute of Internal Auditors, Inc., Standards for the 
Practice of Internal Auditing]  
 
A member shall obtain sufficient relevant data to afford a re asonable basis for conclusions 
or recommendations in relation to any professional services performed. [AICPA Code of 
Professional Conduct] 
 
A practitioner should obtain sufficient relevant data to afford a reasonable basis for 
conclusions or recommendations. [AICPA Management Advisory Services 
Standards]  
 
Sufficient evidence shall be obta ined to provide a reasonable ba sis for the conclusion that is 
expressed in the report. [AICPA Attestation Standards] 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  ACFE Code of Professional Ethics 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.1013 
Sufficient competent evidence should be obta ined to provide a reasonable basis for the 
examination report. [AICPA Standards for Examinations of Prospective 
Financial Information]  
 
Clearly, the accounting profession considers “sufficient relevant data (evidence)” a 
compelling standard of practice, if not a matter of professional ethics. Evidence can be 
defined as all the information that influences a decision maker in reaching decisions that can 
take the form of a report, a set of recommendations, or similar products.  
 
Evidence might be quantitative or qualitative; it may be objective or it may have subjective 
qualities; it may be absolutely compelling to a decision or it may be only mildly persuasive. 
The Certified Fraud Examiner’s task is to  collect and evaluate a sufficient amount of 
relevant evidence to afford a reasonable and logical basis for decisions.  
 
Auditors sometimes say they gather evidence to show that financial statements are 
presented properly or that control procedures are operating effectively. They are following 
a time-tested method of investigation that consists of three parts:  
• Recognize the problem or issue subject to investigation. 
• Gather sufficient relevant evidence about it. 
• Analyze the evidence and reach a conclusion about the problem or issue. 
 
Most auditors’ propositions are expressed positively, such as: “The cash balance is 
accurately stated.” However, an auditor will actu ally seek evidence to show that the cash 
balance is not  properly stated. Imagine a cash balance that is the sum of 110 separate bank 
accounts. An audit team will probably sample these accounts instead of looking at all of 
them. The auditors look for evidence that some of these cash balances are misstated. If 
they fail to find any misstatements in a sufficiently large sample, they have not proved that 
the total is proper, but they have no reason to believe that it is materially misstated. 
 
A literal report on this kind of work would be called “negative assurance,” in which an auditor 
would say: “Nothing came to my attention to make me believe the cash balance is materially 
misstated.” This statement of negative assurance is an accurate report of the audit process. As 
long as the “attention” consists of sufficient re levant evidence, the report is useful. Auditors 
might not know without any doubt that the balance is proper, but they are entitled to act as 
though it is because they have analyzed sufficient relevant evidence.

4.1014   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
Some fraud examinations can take on this same character. Certified Fraud Examiners will be 
assigned to seek the truth about some business records or to try to determine whether some 
control procedures have failed. The Certified Fraud Examiner will seek evidence of 
misstatement or failure, and, if none is found, will report the positive results.  
 
In other cases, a client or employer might already know that fraud, thefts, shortages, control 
failures, or other such events have occurred. The Certified Fraud Examiner’s assignment is 
to then determine how the improper activity is being carried out, by whom, and to what 
extent. This kind of fraud investigation demands sufficient evidence, examples, and suitable 
documentation to prove the how/whom/extent findings. In these cases, the “negative 
assurance” type of conclusion is not appropria te. Certified Fraud Examiners must obtain the 
evidence to show the actual how/whom/extent conclusions.
