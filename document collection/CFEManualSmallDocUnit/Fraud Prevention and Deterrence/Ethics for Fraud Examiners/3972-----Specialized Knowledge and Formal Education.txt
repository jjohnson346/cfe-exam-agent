Specialized Knowledge and Formal Education  
A fraud examiner’s work involves specialized knowledge derived from several other fields, 
such as accounting, auditing, criminology, investigation, and law. A profession might not 
have a body of knowledge truly unique unto itself, but it should have one that has a 
“mystique,” requiring study, comprehension,  and practice, and be over and above the 
everyday abilities other people might possess.  
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  ACFE Code of Professional Ethics 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.1003 
Continuing professional education is becoming a hallmark of professionalism. In recent 
years, ongoing efforts to increase competence and effectiveness have become required by 
some professions. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has led the way 
with the requirements for 120 hours of extra training every three years to maintain and 
increase professional competence. A majority of the state boards of accountancy now 
require continuing education as a prerequisite for renewing CPAs’ licenses. The Association 
of Certified Fraud Examiners requires 20 hours of continuing professional education every 
12-month period, half of which must be directly related to fraud detection or deterrence.
