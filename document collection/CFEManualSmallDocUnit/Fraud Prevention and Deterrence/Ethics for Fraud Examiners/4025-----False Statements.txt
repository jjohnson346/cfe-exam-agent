False Statements 
False statements  include oral or written statements made knowingly false, or made recklessly 
without honest belief in their truth, and with the purpose to mislead or deceive. 
 
Any apparent inaccurate statements should be reviewed and the reasons for the inaccuracies 
documented, including the individuals responsible for the statements and the rationale 
behind them. If the inaccuracies seem more than minor discrepancies, or the reasons for the 
discrepancies appear unjustifiable, a full review may be necessary.
