Embezzlement 
Embezzlement  is generally the fraudulent appropriation of property by one lawfully entrusted 
with its possession. It is the willful taking or conversion to one’s own use, another’s money 
or property of which the wrongdoer acquired possession lawfully by reason of some office, 
employment, or position of trust. 
 
Any indication that embezzlement has occurred or could be occurring should be 
investigated. If financial statements, inventory, or other documents appear out of order, no 
matter how innocuous or nonmaterial, a preliminary review should be made to determine if 
it is accidental or if a full scale investigation should be conducted. Again, the Certified Fraud 
Examiner should follow the situation until he is reasonably assured that there is no active 
fraud taking place.
