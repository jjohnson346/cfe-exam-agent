Detection 
As with false statements perpetrated by management, the best detection methods for 
beneficiary fraud will require the examination of source documents or developing computer 
programs to identify fraudulent patterns. 
 
In either a performance audit or a financial audit, the fraud examiner should include some 
steps to determine if there is a high occurrence rate for beneficiary fraud. By selecting a 
random sample of recipient beneficiaries and examining the documentation supporting the 
benefits, the auditor might be able to estimate the potential of beneficiary fraud schemes.
