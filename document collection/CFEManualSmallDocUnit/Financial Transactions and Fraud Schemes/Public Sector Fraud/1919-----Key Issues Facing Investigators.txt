Key Issues Facing Investigators  
Investigators are looking to maximize the cost-benefit relationship of their resources. In 
general, they believe that auditors are too ready to place undue reliance on documentation, 
and do not understand the concept of “jury appeal,” which is detailed in the next section.  
 
The typical investigator will ask: 
• What is the evidence? Is it clear and convincing? 
• Who are the witnesses? Are they credible? 
• What is the amount of the loss? Can it be proven? 
• What is the intent of the perpetrator? Can it be demonstrated that there was malice 
aforethought? 
• How difficult is the case to investigate? Is it necessary to review reams of documents 
looking for evidence?
