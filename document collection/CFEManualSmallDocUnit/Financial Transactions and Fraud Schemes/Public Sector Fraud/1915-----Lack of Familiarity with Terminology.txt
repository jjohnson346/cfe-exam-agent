Lack of Familiarity with Terminology 
Many investigators assigned to fraud and white-collar crime cases lack a business 
background. This is both a strength and weakness. It is a strength in that they will normally 
ask the same questions and be confused on the same issues as a jury of laymen. It is a 
weakness in that many investigators are confused over accounting concepts, and the auditor 
must explain these concepts in nontechnical language.
