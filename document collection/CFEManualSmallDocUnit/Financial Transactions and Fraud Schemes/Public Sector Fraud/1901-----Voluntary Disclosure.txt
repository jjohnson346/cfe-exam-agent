Voluntary Disclosure 
The Voluntary Disclosure Program was begun by DoD in 1986 and allows contractors to 
inform DoD of irregularities. While the program does not state that voluntary disclosure will 
exempt contractors from prosecution or suspension, it does note that voluntary disclosure 
and full cooperation “are strong indications of an attitude of contractor integrity even in the 
wake of disclosures of potential criminal liability.” 
 
Certain criteria exist for contractors to claim they made a voluntary disclosure. While 
voluntary disclosure of wrongdoing may not exempt a corporation from prosecution, it 
certainly is a contributing factor in the decision of whether to prosecute. The criteria include 
that:  
• The admission must come from the corporation, not an individual employee.  
• Any disclosure precipitated by the knowledge that news of the fraud may soon leak out 
and cause a government investigation would not allow the contractor to claim voluntary 
disclosure.  
• After the disclosure has been made, the corporation must take immediate steps to
