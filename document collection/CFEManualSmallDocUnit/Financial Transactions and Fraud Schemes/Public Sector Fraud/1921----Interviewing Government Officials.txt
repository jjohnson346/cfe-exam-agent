Interviewing Government Officials 
More and more frequently, high government officials find themselves the subjects of 
investigations into allegedly fraudulent activities. In today’s climate of complaints and 
accusations, a high official may be questioned intensely on subjects ranging from 
misallocating parking spaces or personal use of frequent traveler miles on the trivial end to 
bribery and conflict of interest on the serious side.  
 
Regardless of the seriousness of the allegations, the accusation will trigger an all-out 
investigation/audit into the matter. This is true whether the source of the allegation is a 
reliable one or an anonymous tipster. The issue is not the lack of discretion in deciding what 
“cases” to investigate, but how to conduct interviews of senior officials.
