PRESENTING FINDINGS IN THE AUDITORS’ REPORT 
5.21  In presenting findings such as deficiencies in internal control, fraud, illegal acts, 
violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, and abuse, auditors should 
develop the elements of the findings to the extent necessary to achieve the audit 
objectives. Clearly developed audit findings, as discussed in paragraphs 4.14 through 
4.18, assist management or oversight officials of the audited entity in understanding 
the need for taking corrective action. If auditors sufficiently develop the elements of 
a finding, they may provide recommendations for corrective action. 
5.22 Auditors should place their findings in perspective by describing the nature and 
extent of the issues being reported and the extent of the work performed that 
resulted in the finding. To give the reader a basis for judging the prevalence and 
consequences of these findings, auditors should, as applicable, relate the instances 
identified to the population or the number of cases examined and quantify the results 
in terms of dollar value or other measures, as appropriate. If the results cannot be 
projected, auditors should limit their conclusions appropriately.
