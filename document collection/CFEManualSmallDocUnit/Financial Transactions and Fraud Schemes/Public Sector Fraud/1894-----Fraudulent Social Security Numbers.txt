Fraudulent Social Security Numbers 
 
EXAMPLE 
Nine individuals were sentenced to prison in Illinois for terms ranging from 2-½ to nearly 
5 years for a series of schemes through which they defrauded several insurance companies. 
They obtained approximately $500,000 by submitting false claims under fraudulent 
SSNs in 27 incidents in several cities throughout the United States. The claims were based 
on automobile and slip-and-fall accidents that  were either staged or never occurred. In 
addition, three of the defendants, two of whom were insurance company employees, stole 
blank checks from an insurance company and cashed them on forged endorsements for 
$68,000. The group moved from city to city using false names and SSNs, which made 
them difficult to find or identify.
