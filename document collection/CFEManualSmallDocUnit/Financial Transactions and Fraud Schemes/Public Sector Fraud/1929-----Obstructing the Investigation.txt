Obstructing the Investigation 
An official who declines to be interviewed or to answer certain questions acts at his own 
peril if under orders from his own superior or on the advice of counsel. In fact, a superior 
who tells his employees of whatever rank that they do not have to cooperate with 
investigations commits actionable misconduct. Often overlooked is the ability of high 
officials to influence underlings to be less than forthcoming or to “misplace” key 
documents.  
 
When appropriate, the high official should be reminded of all public employees’ obligation 
to assist in the fact-finding process. Interviewers should make no assumption in advance of 
any high official’s integrity or lack thereof. Finally, the high official who offers the “I was 
conducting my own investigation” story usually gets no further than did the “Abscam” 
defendants.
