FINGERPRINT IDENTIFIERS 
A biometric fingerprint identifier  requires the check writer to match fingerprints with the account 
holder’s, which are on file. Banks reported reductions in check fraud of 40 percent after the 
machine was introduced in the mid-1990s. 
 
Non-account holders who want checks cashed at banks that have implemented this system 
are required to put an inkless fingerprint on their check. If the check does prove false, law 
enforcement will already have evidence regarding the fraudster’s identity. The cost to a bank 
of implementing the inkless fingerprint system could be redeemed by preventing a single 
instance of check fraud. Banks throughout the nation now use this technique to cut  
fraud losses.
