CyberSource Advanced Fraud Screen 
CyberSource Advanced Fraud Screen enhanced by Visa is the first e-commerce fraud 
detection system enabled with current worldwide fraud trends and global payment-card 
usage patterns that provides a comprehensive transaction risk assessment of activity. 
Combining this with CyberSource’s hybrid  system (neural network and rules-based 
technology) and merchant-activity data provides e-commerce merchants with targeted fraud 
detection ability. CyberSource Advanced Fraud Screen operates around the clock, 7 days a 
week, 24 hours a day. It effectively screens shoppers located anywhere in the world and 
works with all payment cards. 
 
The CyberSource Advanced Fraud Screen’s risk-management tool uses frequently updated 
intelligence about global payment-card usage patterns, including online and offline 
purchasing profiles, to provide an accurate fraud detection service. This advantage can help 
merchants lower fraud-related costs by identifying risky transactions, and increase consumer 
goodwill by eliminating unintentional “insults” that may occur from incorrectly declined 
orders.
