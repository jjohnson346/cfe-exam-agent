Activation of Cards 
In an effort to curb credit card fraud perpetrated using the mail, companies sending new 
cards in the mail do not activate them until the customer contacts the credit card company. 
Upon contact, the credit card issuer then asks the caller for personal information such as 
their mother’s maiden name and birth date, or other information that the ordinary thief 
probably would not have. Once the information has been satisfactorily answered, the card is 
activated for use.
