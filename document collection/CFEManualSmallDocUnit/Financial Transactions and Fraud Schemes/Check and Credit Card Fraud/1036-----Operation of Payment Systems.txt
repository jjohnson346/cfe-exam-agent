Operation of Payment Systems 
Banks that participate in EBPP or P2P systems can take steps to detect fraudulent 
transactions, either by providing information to customers or by analyzing transactions that 
have characteristics associated with fraud. These measures include the following: 
• Send customers e-mail alerts when a new bill arrives or a payment is sent. The e-mail 
should advise the customer to contact the bank immediately if the bill was not expected 
or the payment was not authorized. 
• Refuse or scrutinize any transactions from a payer or recipient who has been the subject 
of a notice from a credit card issuer indicating that the person was involved in an 
unauthorized credit card transaction or unauthorized transfer to or from a bank account. 
• Ensure that the name on the bank account associated with the P2P account matches the 
name on the P2P account itself. 
• Track and verify payments of similar amounts to the same recipient. 
• Since P2P systems are frequently used to make payments for online activities, be aware 
of activities that are typically associated with fraud and scrutinize transactions with 
customers who engage in such activities. These activities include pyramid schemes, 
online auctions, and sale of items that have a delayed delivery date.
