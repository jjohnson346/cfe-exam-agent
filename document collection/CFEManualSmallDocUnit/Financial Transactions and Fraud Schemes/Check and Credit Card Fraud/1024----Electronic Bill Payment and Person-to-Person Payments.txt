Electronic Bill Payment and Person-to-Person Payments 
Increasingly, consumers are using electronic funds transfers, rather than actual currency or 
paper, to pay bills or make online purchases. Through online services offered by many 
financial institutions, an individual can make banking transactions using a system called 
electronic bill payment and presentment, or EBPP. Individuals can pay each other for goods or 
services through this same electronic form, which is known as the person-to-person, or P2P, 
system.  
 
Although these systems are still young, some experts suggest that they will play an important 
part in the way payments are made, according to the Sheshunoff and A.S. Pratt’s publication,
