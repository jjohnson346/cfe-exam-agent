Check and Credit Card Fraud

Skimming 
This scheme requires a device known as a wedge, which stores up to 200 credit card 
numbers. Credit card skimming is more frequent in businesses where an employee must 
leave the customer’s presence in order to ru n the transaction. A restaurant patron, for 
example, hands his credit card to a waiter who swipes the card into a wedge while 
conducting the legitimate transaction. Once the waiter has collected enough numbers, he can 
either sell them to a counterfeiter or simply produce his own fake cards using the stolen 
information. It may be months before the customer notices phony transactions on his 
statement, making the point of loss very difficult to determine. It follows that the guilty 
waiter is, therefore, unlikely to get caught. Skimming can also occur by tapping into a line 
used to transport credit card data.
