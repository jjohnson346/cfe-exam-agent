SIGNATURE 
If the examiner were investigating a forged signature, he would compare the suspicious 
signature to a sample of the actual one, noting discrepancies between the two. While one’s 
signature may change over time, it would be close to impossible for a forger to duplicate a 
signature with one hundred percent accuracy;  minute identifying characteristics mark 
people’s writing and are not reproducible. 
 
The eBank ™ Discovery System, developed by ASV Technologies, employs signature 
verification software. Using “multiple feat ure set extraction” technology drawn from 
forensic science, the state and quality of a signature’s two-dimensional characteristics are 
analyzed and verified against samples. The program identifies flourishes, arcs, distances 
between letters, and up to 100 other features. Rejected signatures, along with the reason for 
rejection and signature samples, are forwarded to a human for visual verification. ASV 
Technologies claim its results match those of the most highly trained and accurate signature 
verifier.
