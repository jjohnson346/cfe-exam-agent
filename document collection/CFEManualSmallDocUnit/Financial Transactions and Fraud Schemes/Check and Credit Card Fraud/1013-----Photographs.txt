Photographs 
Photographs of the legitimate cardholder will deter counterfeiting to a degree, though they 
have become increasingly easy for counterfeiters to purchase. Photographs can be altered, 
but technological advancements permit digital encoding of the cardholder’s image on the 
magnetic strip of the credit card. Use of this technology would require specialized processing 
terminals that would add to the cost of fraud detection.
