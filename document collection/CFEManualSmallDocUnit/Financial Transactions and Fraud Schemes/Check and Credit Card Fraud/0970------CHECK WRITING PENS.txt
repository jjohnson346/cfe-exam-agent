CHECK WRITING PENS 
When a check is written, a special pen designed to prevent check washing should be used. 
These pens are called “check writing” pens and can be found at just about any office supply 
store. These pens have special ink that will prevent criminals from using solvents to remove 
ink from the check. When someone tries to wash a check written from these pens, it will 
either not work, thereby leaving the check intact, or smear the ink and make it apparent that 
a check has been washed. 
 
Individuals with business accounts are a much greater risk when it comes to check washing. 
Businesses have much stricter requirements in terms of what the company must do to 
protect their checks. If the business doesn’t follow a strict plan to protect their checks, it’s 
likely that if any money is stolen from their accounts, the bank will not return their money. If 
an individual has a business account, they should make sure that the checks are locked 
securely when not in use. Make sure not to leave blank computer-printed checks in the 
printer or the business will be equally liable for the money that could potentially be stolen.
