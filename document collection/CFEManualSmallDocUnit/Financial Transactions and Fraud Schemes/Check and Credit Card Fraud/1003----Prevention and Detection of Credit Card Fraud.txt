Prevention and Detection of Credit Card Fraud 
The essential part of any detection program is the education of the tellers and merchants 
who are responsible for handling the transactions. In a study by Money Magazine, it was 
found that 95 percent of store clerks and cashiers did not check credit card signatures.  
 
While any of the following can occur in a perfectly legitimate transaction, these 
characteristics are frequently present during fraudulent transactions. Tellers and merchants 
should be advised to be alert for the customer who: 
• Takes a card from a pocket instead of a wallet or purse.  
• Purchases an unusual number of expensive items. 
• Makes random purchases, selecting items with  little regard to size, quality, or value. 
• Makes several small purchases to stay under the floor limit, or asks what the floor  
limit is. 
• Does not ask questions on major purchases. 
• Signs the sales draft slowly or awkwardly. 
• Charges expensive items on a newly valid credit card. 
• Cannot provide photo identification when asked. 
• Rushes the merchant or teller. 
• Purchases a large item, such as a television console, and insists on taking it at the time, 
even when delivery is included in the price.

• Makes purchases and leaves the store but then returns to make more purchases. 
• Becomes argumentative with the teller or merchant while waiting for the transaction to 
be completed. 
• Makes large purchases just after the store’s opening or as the store is closing. 
 
Merchants should also be aware of potential signs of fraud in card-not-present transactions: 
• Larger than normal orders. 
• Orders that include several of the same item. 
• Orders made up of big-ticket items. 
• Rush or overnight shipping. 
• Shipping to an international address. 
• Transactions with similar account numbers. 
• Shipping to a single address, but transactions placed on multiple cards. 
• Multiple transactions on one card over a very short period of time. 
• Multiple transactions on one card or a similar card with a single billing. 
• In online transactions, multiple cards used from a single IP (Internet protocol) address. 
• Orders from Internet addresses that make use of a free e-mail service. 
 
Tellers and merchants should be aware of the common signs of forged credit cards: 
• Holograms crudely stamped or badly faked with tiny bits of aluminum foil 
• Misspelled words on the card 
• Altered signature panel 
• Discolored 
• Glued 
• Painted 
• Covered with white tape 
• Cards that appear to have been flattened and restamped 
 
At the consumer level, the credit card user should remember the following: 
• Know where your card is at all times. 
• Never leave your card unattended at work—the re are more credit card thefts in the 
workplace than in any other single situation. 
• Don’t leave the store or ATM without all of the copies and carbons. 
• Don’t leave your card in plain sight where others can get the number. 
• Don’t leave receipts in a public trash can, hotel, or shopping bag. 
• Review monthly statements for accuracy and any items that you might not have charged.

• Review your statements via electronic means rather than waiting for paper statements. If 
possible, cancel paper statements altogether since most fraudsters still practice 
“dumpster diving” and will riffle through your trash for old receipts and credit card 
statements. 
• Sign the back of a new card as soon as you get it and destroy old cards that are outdated 
or no longer used. 
• Make a list of all of your cards and their numbers. This key information is helpful when 
reporting lost or stolen cards. Store this list in a highly secured area. 
• Be wary of offers that come through the mail. 
• Never reveal your card number over the phone to anyone who has offered you a prize 
• Report missing cards immediately. 
• Don’t reveal personal information such as your address and telephone number. 
• Don’t allow a salesperson to record your credit card number on your check. 
• Keep your card out of the view of others in a store or at a public telephone so they 
cannot read the name and account number. 
• Use a tiered, see-through container in your wallet for credit cards, so it will be easier to 
notice missing cards. 
• Always check your card when returned to you after a purchase. Make sure it is your card. 
 
If you become suspicious of a telephone call offer or mail solicitations, report the activity 
using the National Consumers League’s Fraud Center Online Fraud Report Form at
