Check and Credit Card Fraud


:


Dumpster Diving 
Often, check fraud can be as simple as retrieving bank materials from a trash receptacle. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Thirty people were charged in a $10 millio n fraud scheme that involved counterfeiting 
checks, bank statements, and credit card receipts pulled out of the trash. The defendants, 
who defrauded people in 17 states, used checks, bank statements, credit card receipts, and 
other documents from garbage bins to create counterfeit checks, false driver’s licenses, and 
false credit reports, officials said. Counterfeit  blank checks, printed on high-quality color 
printers, allegedly were used to  defraud banks of $2 million. 
 
Obviously, this type of fraud is easily preventable through proper disposal by banks, 
merchants, and individuals of sensitive and confidential materials.
