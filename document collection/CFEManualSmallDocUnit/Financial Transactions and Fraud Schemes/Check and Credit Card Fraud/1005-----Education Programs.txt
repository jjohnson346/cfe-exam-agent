Check and Credit Card Fraud

Education Programs 
Tellers and merchants should be trained to be familiar with the security features of the credit 
card. Although the majority of counterfeit cards contain some of the security features, they 
are usually not complete and offer indicators that the card is not legitimate. Credit card 
issuers should take measures to inform their customers about credit card fraud, what the 
financial institution is doing about fraud, and how the consumer can help.
