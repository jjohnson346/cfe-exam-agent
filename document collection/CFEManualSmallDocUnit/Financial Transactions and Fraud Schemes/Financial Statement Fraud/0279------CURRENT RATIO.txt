CURRENT RATIO 
The current ratio—current assets to current 
liabilities—is probably the most commonly used ratio in financial statement analysis. This 
comparison measures a company’s ability to meet  present obligations from its liquid assets. 
The number of times that current assets exceed current liabilities has long been a quick 
measure of financial strength.  
 
In detecting fraud, this ratio can be a prime indicator of manipulation of the accounts 
involved. Embezzlement will cause the ratio to decrease. Liability concealment will cause a 
more favorable ratio. 
 
In the case example, the drastic change in the current ratio from Year One (2.84) to Year 
Two (1.70) should cause an examiner to look at these accounts in more detail. For instance, 
a check-tampering scheme will usually result in a decrease in the current asset, cash, which 
will in turn decrease the ratio.
