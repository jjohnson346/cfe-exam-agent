Financial Statement Fraud

Multiple Deliverables 
Product and service sales sometimes involve multiple deliverables (or multiple-element 
arrangements). For example, a cell phone company provides a discounted or free cell phone 
to a customer who signs up for a two-year service agreement; in this situation, the 
deliverables include both the product (cell phone) and the service, which spans two years. In 
multiple-element arrangements, the seller completes the earnings process—and thus must 
recognize revenue—over a period of time.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.315 
Under FASB ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition—Multiple-Element Arrangements, companies are 
required to estimate the price of the individual components in a multiple-element sale. 
Companies must then recognize the revenue related to each of the components as they are 
delivered. The inherent inexact nature of the estimates involved in this process leaves this 
revenue recognition method vulnerable to fraud as managers can manipulate the estimated 
price of the individual components in order to delay or accelerate revenue recognition.
