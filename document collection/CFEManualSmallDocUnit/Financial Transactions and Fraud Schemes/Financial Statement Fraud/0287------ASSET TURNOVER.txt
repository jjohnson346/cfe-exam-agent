ASSET TURNOVER 
Net sales divided by average operating assets is the 
calculation used to determine the asset turnover ratio. This ratio is used to determine the 
efficiency with which asset resources are utilized. The case example displays a greater use of 
assets in Year Two than in Year One. 
 
By performing an analysis of the financial statements, the examiner may be directed toward 
the direct evidence to resolve an allegation of fraud. After performing a financial statement 
analysis, the examiner can select statistical samples in the target account and eventually 
examine the source documents. If an irregularity of overstatement is suspected, begin the 
examination with the financial statements. If, however, an irregularity of understatement is 
suspected, begin the examination with a review of the source documents. This rule of thumb 
is especially effective in the area of omission of liabilities, such as litigation, contingent 
liabilities, leases, and some product warranties.
