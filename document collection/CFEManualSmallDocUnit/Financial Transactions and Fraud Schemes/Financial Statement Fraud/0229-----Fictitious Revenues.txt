Financial Statement Fraud

Fictitious Revenues  
Fictitious or fabricated revenues involve the recording of sales of goods or services that did 
not occur. Fictitious sales most often involve fake or phantom customers, but can also 
involve legitimate customers. For example, a fictitious invoice can be prepared (but not 
mailed) for a legitimate customer although the goods are not delivered or the services are not 
rendered. At the beginning of the next accounting period, the sale might be reversed to help 
conceal the fraud, but this may lead to a revenue shortfall in the new period, creating the 
need for more fictitious sales. Another method is to use legitimate customers and artificially 
inflate or alter invoices reflecting higher amounts or quantities than are actually sold.  
 
Generally speaking, revenue is recognized when it is (1) realized or realizable, and (2) earned. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 
Topic 13, Revenue Recognition (now codified in FASB ASC 605-10-S99), to provide additional 
guidance on revenue recognition criteria and to rein in some of the inappropriate practices 
that had been observed. FASB ASC 605-10-S99 states that revenue is typically considered 
realized or realizable, and earned when all of the following criteria are met: 
• Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 
• Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 
• The seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and 
• Collectibility is reasonably assured.
