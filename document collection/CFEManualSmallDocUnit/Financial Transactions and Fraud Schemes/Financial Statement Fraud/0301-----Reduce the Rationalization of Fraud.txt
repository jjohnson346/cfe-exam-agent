Financial Statement Fraud

Reduce the Rationalization of Fraud — Strengthen Employee Personal Integrity  
• Managers should set an example by promot ing honesty in the accounting area. It is 
important that management practice what it preaches. Dishonest acts by management, 
even if they are directed at someone outside of the organization, create a dishonest 
environment that can spread to other business activities and other employees, both 
internal and external. 
• Honest and dishonest behavior should be defined in company policies. Organizational 
accounting policies should clear up any gray areas in accounting procedures. 
• The consequences of violating the rules, including the punishment of violators, should 
be clear.
