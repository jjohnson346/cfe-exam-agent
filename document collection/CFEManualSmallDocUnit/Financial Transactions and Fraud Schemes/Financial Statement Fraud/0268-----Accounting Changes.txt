Accounting Changes 
In general, three types of accounting changes must be disclosed to avoid misleading the user 
of financial statements: accounting principles, estimates, and reporting entities. Although the 
required treatment for each type of change is different, they are all susceptible to

manipulation by a determined fraudster. For example, fraudsters may fail to properly 
retroactively restate financial statements for a change in accounting principle if the change 
causes the company’s financial statements to appear weaker. Likewise, they may fail to 
disclose significant changes in estimates such as the useful lives and estimated salvage values 
of depreciable assets, or the estimates underlying the determination of warranty or other 
liabilities. They may even secretly change the reporting entity, by adding entities owned 
privately by management or by excluding certain company-owned units, in order to improve 
reported results.
