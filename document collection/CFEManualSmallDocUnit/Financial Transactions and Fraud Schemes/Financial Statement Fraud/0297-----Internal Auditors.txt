Internal Auditors 
Internal auditors are responsible for helping to deter fraud by examining and evaluating the 
adequacy and the effectiveness of controls, commensurate with the extent of the potential 
exposure in the various segments of an entity’s operations. The internal auditing standards 
state that the principal mechanism for deterring fraud is internal control. Primary 
responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal control rests with management. The 
Treadway Commission addresses this issue by recommending that internal audit departments 
or staffs have not only the support of top management, but also the necessary resources 
available to carry out their mission. The internal auditors’ responsibility is to aid management 
in the deterrence of fraud by evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of the company’s 
internal control system, as well as the company’s potential exposure to fraud, with particular 
consideration given to the five elements of internal control laid out by COSO.
