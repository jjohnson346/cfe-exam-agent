Financial Statement Fraud

EXAMPLE OF FICTITIOUS REVENUES 
In one case, a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. company recorded several large fictitious sales to 
a series of companies. They invoiced the sa les but did not collect any of the accounts 
receivable, which became severely past due. The manager of the foreign subsidiary arranged 
for false confirmations of  the accounts receivable for audit purposes and even hired actors to 
pretend to be the customers during a visit fr om U.S. management. Background checks on 
the customers would have revealed that some of the companies were fictitious while others 
either were undisclosed related parties or operated in industries that would have no need for 
the goods supposedly supplied. An investigation  revealed that the manager of the foreign 
subsidiary directed the scheme to record fictitious revenues in order to meet unrealistic 
revenue goals set by U.S. management.  
 
In some cases, companies go to great lengths to conceal fictitious sales. A sample journal 
entry from such a case is detailed below. A fictional entry is made to record a purported

purchase of fixed assets. This entry debits fixed assets for the amount of the alleged 
purchase and the credit is to cash for the payment: 
 
Date Description Ref. Debit Credit 
12/01/X1 Fixed Assets 104 350,000  
 Cash 101  350,000 
 
A fictitious sales entry is then made for the same amount as the false purchase, debiting 
accounts receivable and crediting the sales account. The cash outflow that supposedly paid 
for the fixed assets is “returned” as payment on the receivable account, though in practice 
the cash might never have moved if the fraudsters didn’t bother to falsify that extra 
documentary support. 
 
Date Description Ref. Debit Credit 
12/01/X1 Accounts Rec 120 350,000  
 Sales 400  350,000 
12/15/X1 Cash 101 350,000  
 Accounts Rec 120  350,000 
 
The result of this completely fabricated sequence of events is an increase in both fixed assets 
and revenue. The debit could alternatively have been directed to other accounts, such as 
inventory or accounts payable, or simply left in accounts receivable if the fraud were 
committed close to the year’s end and the receivable could be left outstanding without 
attracting undue attention.
