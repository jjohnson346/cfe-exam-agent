Tax Return Review 
Tax returns are good sources of additional and comparative information on the operations 
of the business. A complete review and comparison to the financial statement may provide 
information unknown to the lender, or disclose unexplained discrepancies. Again, the lack of 
properly prepared or timely filed tax returns may be a method of stalling or not providing 
the required information. Most perpetrators of fraud are reluctant to continue the deception 
and falsify a tax return. Year-after-year extensions and filing of the tax returns on the last 
possible date could be a ploy to cover up financial statement and tax return differences.
