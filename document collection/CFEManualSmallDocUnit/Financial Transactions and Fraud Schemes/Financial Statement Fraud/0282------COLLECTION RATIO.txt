COLLECTION RATIO   
Accounts receivable aging is measured by the 
collection ratio. It divides 365 days by the receivable turnover ratio to arrive at the average 
number of days to collect receivables. In general, the lower the collection ratio, the faster 
receivables are collected. A fraud examiner may use this ratio as a first step in detecting 
fictitious receivables or larceny and skimming schemes. Normally, this ratio will stay fairly 
consistent from year to year, but changes in billing policies or collection efforts may cause a 
fluctuation. The example shows a favorable reduction in the collection ratio from 226.3 in 
Year One to 170.33 in Year Two. This means that the company is collecting its receivables 
more quickly in Year Two than in Year One.
