Channel-Stuffing 
A challenging area of revenue recognition that has attracted the attention of the SEC is 
known as “channel-stuffing.” Channel-stuffing refers to the sale of an unusually large 
quantity of a product to distributors who are encouraged to overbuy through the use of deep 
discounts or extended payment terms. This practice is especially attractive to industries with 
high gross margins, such as tobacco, pharmaceuticals, perfume, soda concentrate, and 
branded consumer goods, because it can increase short-term earnings. On the downside, 
however, stealing from future periods’ sales makes it harder to achieve sales goals in those 
future periods. The pressure to meet sales goals can, in turn, lead to increasingly disruptive 
levels of channel-stuffing and, ultimately, to a restatement. Although orders are received, the 
terms of the order might raise questions about the collectibility of the accounts receivable, 
and any existing side agreements that grant a right of return may, effectively, turn the sales 
into consignment sales. Also, there might be a greater risk of returns for certain products if 
they cannot be sold before their shelf life ends.  
 
In recent years, the SEC has brought enforcement actions or charges related to channel-stuffing 
against a number of major U.S. corporations, including McAfee, Inc. and The Coca-Cola 
Company. In 2006, the SEC released a press release stating that McAfee agreed to settle 
the proceedings and pay a $50 million penalty after being charged by the SEC with 
accounting fraud (http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2006-3.htm). According to the press 
release, the accounting fraud charges included allegations that “McAfee used a variety of 
undisclosed ploys during [the years 1998 throug h 2000] to aggressively oversell its products 
to distributors in amounts that far exceeded the public’s demand for the products.” The 
SEC alleged that, as part of this channel-stuffing scheme, McAfee: 
• Improperly recorded the sales to distributors as revenue; 
• Offered its distributors lucrative sales incentives, including deep price discounts and 
rebates, in an effort to persuade the distributors to continue to buy and stockpile 
McAfee products; 
• Secretly paid distributors millions of dollars to hold the excess inventory rather than

return it to McAfee for a refund and consequent reduction in McAfee’s revenues; 
• Used an undisclosed, wholly-owned subsidiary, Net Tools, Inc. to repurchase inventory 
that McAfee had oversold to its distributors; and, 
• Took action to conceal the fraud from investors by, among other things, wrongly 
recording in its books the payments and discounts that it offered to distributors, and 
improperly manipulating reserve accounts to increase inadequate sales reserves and cover 
the costs of the distributor payments. 
 
In 2005, the SEC issued a press release announcing an enforcement action against The 
Coca-Cola Company relating to its channel-stuffing practice in Japan known as “gallon 
pushing” ( http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2005-58.htm). According to the press release, 
the SEC found that, from 1997 through 1999, Coca-Cola failed to disclose certain end-of-
 quarter sales practices used to meet earnings expectations. Specifically, Coca-Cola was 
alleged by the SEC to have offered extended credit to Japanese bottlers to induce them to 
purchase quantities of beverage concentrate the bottlers otherwise would not have 
purchased until a following period. Although Coca-Cola’s accounting treatment for sales 
made in connection with gallon pushing was found to be without issue, the SEC did find 
that Coca-Cola’s failure to disclose the impact of gallon pushing on current and future 
earnings, as well as related false statements and omissions within a pertinent Form 8-K, 
violated the antifraud and periodic reporting requirements of the federal securities laws.
