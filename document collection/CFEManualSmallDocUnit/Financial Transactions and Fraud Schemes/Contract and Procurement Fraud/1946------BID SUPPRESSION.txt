BID SUPPRESSION 
In this type of scheme, one or more competitors agrees with at least one other competitor to 
refrain from bidding or agrees to withdraw a previously submitted bid so that a contractor’s 
bid will be accepted. Other forms of this activity involve agreements by competitors to 
fabricate bid protests or to coerce suppliers and subcontractors not to deal with 
nonconspirators who submit bids. 
 
A variation of bid suppression occurs when competitors make arrangements to refrain from 
competing in a designated portion of a market. This might be accomplished based on 
customer or geographic area. The result of such a division is that competing firms will not 
bid or will submit only complementary bids (discussed below) when requests for bids are 
issued in the competitor’s unassigned area.
