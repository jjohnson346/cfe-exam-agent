COMPLEMENTARY BIDS 
Complementary bidding, also known as “protective” or “shadow” bidding, occurs when 
competitors submit token bids that are too high to be accepted (or if competitive in price, 
then on special terms that will not be acceptable). Such bids are not intended to secure the 
buyer’s acceptance, but are merely designed to give the appearance of genuine bidding.
