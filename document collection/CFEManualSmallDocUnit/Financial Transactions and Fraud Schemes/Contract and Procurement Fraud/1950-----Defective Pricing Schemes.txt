Defective Pricing Schemes 
Defective pricing occurs during the negotiated contracting process when contractors fail to 
disclose accurate cost or pricing data in their price proposals, resulting in an increased 
contract price. 
 
Examples of defective pricing schemes generally involve the submission of inflated labor 
costs and inflated material/parts costs. Other schemes involve: 
• The use of vendors other than the one proposed. 
• Not disclosing documents on vendor discounts. 
• Changing make or buy decisions. 
• Not disclosing residual material inventory. 
• Inflating costs by channeling work under contract through a dummy company. 
• Withholding information on batch purchases.
