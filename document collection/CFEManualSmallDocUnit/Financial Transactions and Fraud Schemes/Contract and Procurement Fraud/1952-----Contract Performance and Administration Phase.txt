Contract Performance and Administration Phase 
Contract performance activities include change orders; timely review of completed portions 
prior to sign-off and release of monies; and assessment of deliverables for compliance with 
the terms of the contract, including quality control. There are two basic schemes perpetrated 
during the performance phase: product substitution and mischarges (accounting, material, 
and labor).
