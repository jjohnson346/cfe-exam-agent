Document Storage 
In this electronic age, most companies are backing up documents via electronic media rather 
than filling file cabinets. Storage expense scares small businesses. Document storage 
companies are available for storing tangible and electronic documents, but can be costly. 
Hard drive back-up appears to be the most cost efficient means of storage, but it requires 
companies to have the computer gusto to withstand large amounts of information.  
 
Most importantly, documents must remain safe (for confidentiality and destruction 
purposes) and be easily accessible in the event of potential litigation and legal requests for 
documents.
