MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL 
In performing the ICOFR assessment, management must choose a suitable internal control 
framework against which to evaluate the design and effectiveness of the company’s ICOFR. 
The most commonly used model in the United States is the Internal Control—Integrated 
Framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the 
Treadway Commission, which provides five components of effective internal controls: 
• Control Environment 
• Control Activities 
• Risk Assessment 
• Information and Communication 
• Monitoring 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.209 
The COSO framework is discussed in more detail in the “Fraud Prevention Programs” 
chapter in the Fraud Prevention and Deterrence section of the Fraud Examiners Manual. 
Further detail on the Internal Control—Integrated Framework is also available at the COSO 
website (http://www.coso.org). 
  
Additionally, management must: 
• Determine which internal controls to test in performing the assessment, considering the 
significance of each control, both individually and in the aggregate; 
• Evaluate whether the failure of a control could result in a misstatement to the financial 
statements, the likelihood and magnitude of any resulting misstatement, and whether 
other controls are in place to mitigate this occurrence; 
• Determine which locations or business units to include in the assessment, if applicable; 
• Evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of the internal controls using the internal 
control framework chosen as a guide; 
• Evaluate the probability of occurrence and the size of potential misstatements resulting 
from the internal control deficiencies identified and determine whether they, either 
individually or in the aggregate, constitute material weaknesses (any deficiency where the 
likelihood of potential misstatement is more than remote) or significant deficiencies (any 
deficiency where the likelihood of potential misstatement is more than remote and the 
magnitude is more than inconsequential); 
• Provide sufficient documentation to support the assessment of ICOFR, including 
documenting the design of the internal controls and the results of management’s testing 
and evaluation; and 
• Communicate the assessment findings to the independent auditor and any other 
applicable parties. 
 
Recognizing that each company differs with regard to internal control structure, the rules 
state that the nature of the testing performed by management will depend on the specific 
circumstances of the company and the significance of the control being tested. However, the 
rules also assert that inquiries alone are generally not a sufficient basis for management’s 
assessment.  
 
In July 2007, the SEC issued guidance specifically  addressed to management about fulfilling 
their responsibilities pertaining to reporting on internal control over financial reporting. The 
guidance emphasizes a top-down, risk-based approach to management’s evaluation of 
ICOFR, and explicitly states that an evaluation performed in compliance with the guidance is

one way that management can satisfy the internal control requirements established by 
Sarbanes-Oxley. In providing direction to assist companies’ management in evaluation and 
assessment of the ICOFR, the Guidance addresses the following topics: 
• Identifying Financial Reporting Risks and Controls 
• Evaluating Evidence of the Operating Effectiveness of ICOFR 
• Reporting Considerations
