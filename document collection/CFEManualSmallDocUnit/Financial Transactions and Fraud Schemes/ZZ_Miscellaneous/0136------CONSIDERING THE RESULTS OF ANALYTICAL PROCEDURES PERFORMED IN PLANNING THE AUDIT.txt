CONSIDERING THE RESULTS OF ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES PERFORMED IN PLANNING THE AUDIT  
AU section 329, Analytical Procedures, requires that analytical procedures be performed in 
planning the audit with the objective of identifying the existence of unusual transactions or 
events, and amounts, ratios, and trends that might indicate matters “that have financial 
statement and audit planning implications.” If  the results of these procedures yield unusual 
or unexpected relationships, the auditor should consider the results in identifying the risks of 
material misstatement due to fraud.
