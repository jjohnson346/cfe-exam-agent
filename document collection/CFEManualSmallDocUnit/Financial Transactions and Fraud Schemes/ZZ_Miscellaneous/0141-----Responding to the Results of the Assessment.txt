Responding to the Results of the Assessment 
Once the auditor has gathered the information and assessed the risk of fraud, he must 
determine what impact the assessment will have on how the audit is conducted. For 
example, the auditor may need to design additional or different audit procedures to obtain 
more reliable evidence in support of account balances, transactions, etc., or to obtain 
additional corroboration of management’s expl anations and representations concerning 
material matters (e.g., third-party confirmation, documentation from independent sources, 
use of a specialist, and analytical procedures).
