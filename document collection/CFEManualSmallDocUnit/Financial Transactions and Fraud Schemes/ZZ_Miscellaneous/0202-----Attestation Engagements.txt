Attestation Engagements 
Attestation engagements can cover financial or non-financial information. These 
engagements involve expressing a specified level of assurance about the subject matter or 
assertion related to the subject matter depending on the users’ needs. There are three types 
of attestation engagements: 
• Examination, which involves expressing an opinion on “whether the subject matter is 
based on (or in conformity with) the criteria in all material respects or the assertion is 
presented (or fairly stated), in all material respects, based on the criteria.” 
• Review, consisting of expression of a conclusion about “whether any information came 
to the auditors’ attention that indicates that the subject matter is not based on (or not 
in conformity with) the criteria or the assertion is not presented (or not fairly stated) in 
all material respects based on the criteria.” 
• Agreed-upon procedures engagement, which involves performing specific procedures on 
the subject matter.
