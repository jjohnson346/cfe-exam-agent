QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE 
Audit organizations performing government audits must have an internal quality control 
system in place. This system is composed of the organization’s leadership, and its policies 
and procedures established to provide reasonable assurance that the organization is in 
compliance with all applicable audit standards. As part of the system, organizations should 
establish policies and procedures that collectively address: 
• Leadership responsibilities for quality of audit and attestation engagements; 
• Independence, legal, and ethical requirements;  
• Initiation, acceptance, and continuation of audit and attestation engagements;  
• Human resource issues;  
• Performance, documentation, and reporting of audit and attestation engagements; and 
• Monitoring of quality. 
 
Additionally, audit organizations conducting audits and attestations under GAGAS must 
have periodic external peer reviews of their auditing and attestation engagement practices at
