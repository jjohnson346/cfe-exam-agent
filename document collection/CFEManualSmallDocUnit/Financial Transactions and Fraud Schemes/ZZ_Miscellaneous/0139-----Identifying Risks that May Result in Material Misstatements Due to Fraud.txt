Identifying Risks that May Result in Material Misstatements Due to Fraud 
After gathering the information as discussed above, the auditor should consider the 
information in the context of the three conditions present when fraud occurs—
 incentives/pressures, opportunities, and attitudes/rationalizations. 
 
The auditor should consider: 
• The type of risk that may exist, i.e., whether it involves fraudulent financial reporting or 
misappropriation of assets;

• The significance  of the risk, i.e., whether it is of a magnitude that could result in a possible 
material misstatement; 
• The likelihood  of the risk, i.e., the likelihood that it will result in a material misstatement; 
and 
• The pervasiveness of the risk, i.e., whether the potential risk is pervasive to the financial 
statement as a whole or is specifically related to a particular assertion, account, or class of 
transactions.
