EVALUATING WHETHER ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES PERFORMED INDICATE A PREVIOUSLY UNRECOGNIZED RISK OF FRAUD 
Analytical procedures performed during the audit may result in identifying unusual or 
unexpected relationships that should be considered in assessing the risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. Determining whether a particular trend or relationship is a risk of 
fraud requires professional judgment. Unusual relationships involving year-end revenue and 
income often are particularly relevant and might include (1) uncharacteristically large 
amounts of income reported in the last week or two of the reporting period from unusual 
transactions and (2) income that is inconsistent with trends in cash flow from operations. 
 
Analytical procedures are useful because management or employees generally are unable to 
manipulate all the information necessary to produce normal or expected relationships. AU 
section 316 provides several examples, including the following: 
• The relationship of net income to cash flows from operations may appear unusual 
because management recorded fictitious revenues and receivables, but was unable to 
manipulate cash. 
• Changes in inventory, accounts payable, sales, or costs of sales from the prior period to 
the current period may be inconsistent, indicating a possible theft of inventory because 
the employee was unable to manipulate all of the related accounts. 
• An unexpected or unexplained relationship between sales volume as determined from 
the accounting records and production statistics maintained by operations personnel 
(which are more difficult for management to manipulate) may indicate a possible 
misstatement of sales.
