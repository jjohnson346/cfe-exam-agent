EXAMPLES OF RESPONSES TO IDENTIFIED RISKS OF MISSTATEMENTS ARISING FROM MISAPPROPRIATIONS OF ASSETS 
If the auditor identifies a risk of material misstatement due to fraud relating to 
misappropriation of assets, the auditor may wish to include additional procedures. For 
example, if a particular asset is highly susceptible to misappropriation, the auditor may wish 
to conduct further testing of the controls to prevent and detect such misappropriation.
