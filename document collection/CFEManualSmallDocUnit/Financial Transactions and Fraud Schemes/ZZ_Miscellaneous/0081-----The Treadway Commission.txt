The Treadway Commission 
The National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting, more commonly referred to 
as the Treadway Commission, was formed in the United States in 1985 to better define the 
responsibilities of the auditor in detecting and preventing fraud. The professional auditing 
organizations — the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, The Institute of 
Internal Auditors, and the American Accounting Association, among others — established 
the Treadway Commission to underwrite a study and make recommendations. In an effort 
to curb fraudulent financial reporting, the Treadway Commission offered four 
recommendations that, when combined with other measures, might help reduce the 
probability of fraudulent financial reporting. These recommendations are addressed to the 
board of directors’ audit committee.
