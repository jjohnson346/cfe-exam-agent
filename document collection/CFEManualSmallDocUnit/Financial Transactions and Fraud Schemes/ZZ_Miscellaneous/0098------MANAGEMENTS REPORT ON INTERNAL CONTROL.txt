MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL 
The provisions of Section 404 require management to acknowledge its responsibility for the 
ICOFR of the company and to assess the operating effectiveness of those controls. As a 
result, public companies must issue an additional internal control report within their annual 
report containing: 
• A statement of management’s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate 
ICOFR; 
• A statement identifying the framework that management used in conducting the 
assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s ICOFR; 
• Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s ICOFR as of the end of 
the company’s most recent fiscal year, including disclosure of any material weaknesses 
identified in the company’s ICOFR and an explicit statement as to whether the ICOFR 
is effective; and 
• A statement that the company’s independent auditor has issued an attestation report 
covering management’s assessment of the company’s ICOFR. The auditor’s attestation 
report must also be filed with the annual report.
