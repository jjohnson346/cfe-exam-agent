External Auditors 
Changes in the auditing landscape, primarily those stemming from the passage of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, have led to a dichotomy of standards for external auditors. Auditors of 
public companies — companies registered with the SEC—must adhere to the auditing rules 
promulgated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). Conversely, 
for audits of non-SEC-registered entities, the generally accepted auditing standards laid out 
by the AICPA’s Auditing Standards Board (ASB) apply. It should be noted, however, that 
the PCAOB adopted all of the ASB’s standards already in existence on April 16, 2003 (i.e., 
all standards issued through Statement on Auditing Standard (SAS) No. 101) as interim 
standards applicable to auditors of public companies, unless and until such standards are

superseded or amended by the PCAOB. Therefore, the discussion below on AU Section 
316, which codifies SAS No. 99, applies to all external auditors; whereas, AU sections 314 
and 339, which respectively codify SAS Nos. 109 and 103, apply to audits of non-public 
entities only. Likewise, the PCAOB standards discussed apply only to auditors of SEC-
 registered companies.
