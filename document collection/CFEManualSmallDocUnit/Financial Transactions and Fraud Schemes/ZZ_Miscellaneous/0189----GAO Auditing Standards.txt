GAO Auditing Standards  
Standards for government auditors are fundamentally based on the generally accepted 
auditing standards (GAAS) set for auditors of public companies. However, for audits of 
government organizations, programs, activities, functions, and funds, the requirements of 
Government Auditing Standards, also known as the Yellow Book, go beyond GAAS. (The 
following discussion of the Yellow Book standards is based upon the July 2007 revision of 
the standards. For more information, please see the full text of the GAO standards, available 
at www.gao.gov.)
