General Controls 
Sales entries and general ledger access controls should include documented policies and 
procedures, which are communicated directly from management. The control procedures 
will generally cover the following subjects: 
• Appropriate segregation of duties and access control procedures regarding who makes 
ledger transactions will be followed. 
• Transactions must be properly recorded as to amount, date of occurrence, and ledger 
account.  
• Proper safeguard measures will be adopted to ensure physical access to the account 
systems. Additional measures should ensure the security of company assets.  
• Independent reconciliations as well as internal verification of accounts will be performed 
on ledger accounts.1
