Cash Account Analysis 
Cash larceny can be detected by reviewing and analyzing all journal entries made to the cash 
accounts. This review and analysis should be performed on a regular basis. If an employee is 
unable to conceal the fraud through altering the source documents, such as the cash register 
tape, then he may resort to making a journal entry directly to cash. In general (and except in 
financial institutions), there are very few instances in everyday business activity where an 
independent journal entry is necessary for cash. One of these exceptions is the recording of 
the bank service charge. However, this is an easy journal entry to trace to its source 
documentation, namely the bank statement. Therefore, all other entries directly to cash are 
suspect and should be traced to their source documentation or explanation. Suspect entries 
will generally credit the cash account and correspondingly debit various other accounts such 
as a sales contra account or bad debt expenses.
