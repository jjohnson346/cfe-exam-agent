Analytical Review 
Analyzing the relationship between sales, cost of sales, and the returns and allowances can 
detect inappropriate refunds and discounts.  
• If a large cash fraud is suspected, a thorough review of these accounts may enlighten the 
examiner as to the magnitude of the suspected fraud.  
• An analysis of refunds and returns and allowances with the actual flow of inventory may 
reveal some fraud schemes. The refund should cause an entry to inventory, even if it is 
damaged inventory. Likewise, a return will cause a corresponding entry to an inventory 
account.

• There should be a linear relationship between sales and returns and allowances over a 
relevant range. Any change in this relationship may point to a fraud scheme unless there 
is another valid explanation such as a change in the manufacturing process, change in 
product line, or change in price.
