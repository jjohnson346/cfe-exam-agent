Detecting Lapping of Sales or Receivables   
Lapping can usually be detected by comparing the dates of the customer’s payments with the 
dates the customer’s accounts are posted. This will require an examination of the source 
documents, such as the composition of bank deposits. Discrepancies should be investigated.

Confirmation of customers’ accounts is another method that might detect lapping. 
Confirmations are especially effective on large accounts where the time value of money is an 
issue. However, customers who pay on invoice rather than on balance might not know the 
exact balance of their account. If this is the case, it might be more effective to confirm by 
invoice and reconstruct the account balance using the source documents in the files and the 
results of the confirmation. If fraud is suspected, ask the customer or the bank to return a 
copy of both the front and the back of the check(s) used to pay specific invoices. Match the 
data on the check copies with the posting dates in the customer’s account.
