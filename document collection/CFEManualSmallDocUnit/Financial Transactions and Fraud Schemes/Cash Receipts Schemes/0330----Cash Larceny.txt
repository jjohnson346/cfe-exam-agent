Cash Larceny 
In the occupational fraud setting, a cash larceny may be defined as the intentional taking of 
an employer’s cash (the term cash includes both currency and checks) without the consent 
and against the will of the employer.

A cash larceny scheme can take place in any circumstance in which an employee has access 
to cash. Every company must deal with the receipt, deposit, and distribution of cash, so 
every company is potentially vulnerable to a cash larceny scheme. While the circumstances in 
which an employee might steal cash are nearly limitless, most larceny schemes involve the 
theft of incoming cash, currency on hand (in a cash register, cash box, etc.), or theft of cash 
from the victim organization’s bank deposits.
