Detection at the Register 
• As cash is received, whether at a register or through the mail, it is important to ensure 
that the employees responsible for completing these important tasks are informed of 
their responsibility and properly supervised.  
• Access to the register must be closely monitored and access codes must be kept secure.  
• An employee other than the register worker should be responsible for preparing register 
count sheets and agreeing them to register totals.  
• Popular concealment methods must be watched for. These methods, discussed earlier, 
include checks for cash, reversing transactions, register tape destruction or alteration, 
and sales cash counts. 
• Complete register documentation and cash must be delivered to the appropriate 
personnel in a timely manner.  
• Cash thefts are sometimes revealed by customers who have either paid money on an 
account and have not received credit, or in some cases, when they notice that the credit 
they have been given does not agree with the payment they have made. Complaints and 
inquiries are also received frequently from banks.
