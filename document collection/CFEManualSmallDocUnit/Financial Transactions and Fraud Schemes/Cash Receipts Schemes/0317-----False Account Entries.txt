False Account Entries 
Intercepting the customer’s statements will keep him in the dark as to the status of his 
account, but as long as the customer’s payments are being skimmed, his account is slipping 
further and further past due. The perpetrator must bring the account back up to date in 
order to conceal his crime. Lapping is one way to keep accounts current as the employee 
skims from them. Another way is to make false entries in the victim organization’s 
accounting system.
