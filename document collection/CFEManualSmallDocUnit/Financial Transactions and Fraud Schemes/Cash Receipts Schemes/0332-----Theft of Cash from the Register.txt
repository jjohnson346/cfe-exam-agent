Theft of Cash from the Register 
A large percentage of cash larceny schemes occur at the cash register, and for good reason—
 the register is usually where the cash is. The register (or similar cash collection points like 
cash drawers or cash boxes) is usually the most common point of access to cash for 
employees, so it is understandable that this is where larceny schemes frequently occur. 
Furthermore, there is often a great deal of activity at the register, numerous transactions that 
require employees to handle cash. This can serve as a cover for the theft of cash. In a flurry 
of activity, with money being passed back and forth between customer and employee, an 
employee can often slip cash out of the register and into his pocket undetected.  
 
The most straightforward cash larceny scheme is to simply open the register and remove 
currency or checks. (See “Cash Larceny from the Register” flowchart.) The theft is often 
committed as a sale is being conducted so that it appears to be part of the transaction. In 
other circumstances, the perpetrator waits for a slow moment when no one is around to 
notice him digging into the cash drawer.  
 
Recall that the difficulty in detecting skimming schemes comes from the fact that the stolen 
funds are never entered on the victim organization’s accounts. In a larceny scheme, on the 
other hand, the funds that the perpetrator steals have already been reflected on the register 
tape. As a result, an imbalance will result between the register tape and the cash drawer.  
 
A register is balanced by comparing the transactions on the register tape to the amount of 
cash on hand. Sales, returns, and other register transactions that are recorded on the register 
tape are added to or subtracted from a known balance to arrive at a total for the period in 
question. The actual cash is then counted and the two totals are compared. If the register 
tape shows that there should be more cash in the register than what is present, the 
discrepancy may be due to larceny.

The actual method for taking money at the register — opening the register and removing 
currency — rarely varies. It is the methods used by perpetrators to avoid getting caught that 
distinguish larceny schemes. Oddly, in many instances the perpetrator has no plan for 
avoiding detection. A large part of fraud is rationalizing; the employee convinces himself that 
he is somehow entitled to what he is taking, or that what he is doing is not actually a crime. 
Register larceny schemes frequently begin when the perpetrator convinces himself that he is 
only “borrowing” the funds to cover a temporary monetary need. These people might carry 
the missing currency in their registers for several days, deluding themselves in the belief that 
they will one day repay the funds they have stolen.  
 
The employee who does nothing to camouflage his crimes is easily caught. More dangerous 
is the person taking active steps to hide his crimes. One basic way for an employee to 
disguise the fact that he is stealing currency is to take money from someone else’s register.

In some retail organizations, employees are assigned to certain registers. Alternatively, one 
register is used and each employee has an access code. When cash is missing from a certain 
cashier’s register, that cashier is obviously the most likely suspect for the theft. Therefore, by 
stealing from a coworker’s register, or by using someone else’s access code to enter the 
register, the perpetrator makes sure that another employee will be the prime suspect in the 
theft.  
 
EXAMPLE 
A teller for a retail sales company simply signed onto a register, rang a “no sale” and took 
currency from the drawer. Over  a period of time, the teller took approximately $6,000 
through this simple method. In order to get away with the theft, the teller waited until a 
coworker was on break, then logged onto that person’s register, rang a “no sale” and took 
the cash. The resulting cash shortage therefore appeared in the register of an honest 
employee, deflecting attention from the true thief.  
 
A very unsophisticated way to avoid detection is to steal currency in very small amounts over 
an extended period of time. Because the missing amounts are small, the shortages may be 
dismissed as accounting errors rather than theft. Typically, the employee becomes dependent 
on the extra money he is pilfering and his thefts increase in scale or become more frequent, 
which causes the scheme to be uncovered. Most retail organizations track overages or 
shortages by employee, making this method largely ineffective.
