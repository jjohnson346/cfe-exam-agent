Segregation of Duties 
The primary prevention of cash larceny is segregation of duties. Whenever one individual 
has control over the entire accounting transaction (e.g., authorization, recording, and 
custody), the opportunity is present for cash fraud. Each of the following duties and 
responsibilities should ideally be segregated:  
• Cash receipts 
• Cash counts 
• Bank deposits 
• Deposit receipt reconciliation 
• Bank reconciliations 
• Posting of deposits 
• Cash disbursements 
 
If any one person has the authority to collect the cash, deposit the receipts, record that 
collection, and disburse company funds, the risk that fraud can occur is high.
