Surprise Cash Counts and Procedure Supervision 
Surprise cash counts and supervisory observations are a useful fraud prevention method if 
properly used. It is important that employees know that cash will be counted on a sporadic 
and unscheduled basis. These surprise counts must be made at all steps of the process from 
receiving the check to deposit.
