REVERSING TRANSACTIONS 
Some employees conceal cash larceny by processing reversing transactions, which cause the 
register tape to reconcile to the amount of cash on hand after the theft. By processing false 
voids or refunds, an employee can reduce the cash balance reflected on the register tape.  
 
EXAMPLE 
A cashier received payments from a customer and recorded the transactions on her system. 
She stole the payments from the customers, then destroyed the company’s receipts that 
reflected the transactions. To complete the cover-up, the cashier went back and voided the 
transactions that she had entered at the time the payments were received. The reversing 
entries brought the receipt totals in to balance with the cash on hand.
