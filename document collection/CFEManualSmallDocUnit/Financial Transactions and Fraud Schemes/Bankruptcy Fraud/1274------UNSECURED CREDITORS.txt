UNSECURED CREDITORS  
Unsecured creditors  are those that have a claim against the debtor that arose before the 
bankruptcy petition was filed and do not have a perfected security interest. Title 11, U.S.C., 
section 507 gives some of the holders of unsecured claims priority over other unsecured 
claim holders. Among those claims that have priority are administrative expenses (costs 
associated with the operation of the business and professional fees while the business or 
individual is in bankruptcy), selected pre-petition unpaid wages, pre-petition contributions 
required but not made to employees benefit plans, pre-petition unpaid alimony and support 
payments, and selected pre-petition tax claims.
