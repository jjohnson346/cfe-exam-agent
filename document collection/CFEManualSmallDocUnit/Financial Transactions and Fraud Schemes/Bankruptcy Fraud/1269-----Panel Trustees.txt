Panel Trustees 
Panel trustees are independent professionals (usually attorneys) who serve in Chapter 7 cases 
in each federal district in the country. Trustees also might serve in Chapter 11 cases where 
operation of the debtor’s business is considered appropriate. Trustees or others might 
develop a plan of reorganization to conclude the Chapter 11 proceedings. If the business 
cannot be reorganized, the trustee might petition the court to convert the case to Chapter 7 
or develop a plan of liquidation under Chapter 11. The duties of a trustee are specifically 
enumerated in Title 11, U.S.C., section 704 (in Chapter 7 cases) and Title 11, U.S.C., section 
1106 (in Chapter 11 cases). The duties of a trustee are as follows: administer assets, liquidate 
assets, pay creditors, litigate matters where necessary, have the right to sue and be sued, 
conduct hearings, conduct investigations of financial affairs of the debtor, file reports as 
required by the Office of the UST and, where a ppropriate, file criminal referrals with the 
United States Attorney’s Office. A trustee’s compensation is statutorily defined under the 
bankruptcy code.
