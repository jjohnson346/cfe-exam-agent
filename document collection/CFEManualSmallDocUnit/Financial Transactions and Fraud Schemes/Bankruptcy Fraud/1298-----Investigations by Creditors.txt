Investigations by Creditors  
Individual creditors might conduct their own investigations and assist Chapter 7 and Chapter 
11 trustees in performing their investigations. Trustees are normally very appreciative of 
creditors who can provide information regarding the financial affairs of the debtor. Creditors 
also can attend the 341(a) examination of the debtor and ask pertinent questions. Creditors 
who bring copies of documents, such as prior loan applications or pictures of particular 
assets, to the 341(a) examination are of great interest to trustees. Creditors can ask the 
debtor what happened to the various assets listed on the loan applications or assets shown in 
photographs.
