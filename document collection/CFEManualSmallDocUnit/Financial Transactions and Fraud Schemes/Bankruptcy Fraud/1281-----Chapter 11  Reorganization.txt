Chapter 11 — Reorganization  
Often, debtors want to avoid liquidation, and Chapter 11 provides a type of bankruptcy that 
is designed to help the debtor by reorganizing the business. The code allows for debtors to 
restructure their debt, pay their creditors, and emerge from bankruptcy. Part 1 of the chapter 
deals with officers and administration. Part 2 deals with the plan of reorganization. Part 3 
deals with postconfirmation matters. Part 4 deals with railroad reorganization. 
 
The purpose of the Chapter 11 filing is to allow the debtor breathing room from the 
creditors so that the debtor can reorganize its financial affairs and continue as a going 
concern. If the court is provided with sufficient probable cause regarding the financial affairs 
of the debtor, a trustee or examiner can be appointed by the court.
