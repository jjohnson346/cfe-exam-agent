Physical Safeguards 
All merchandise should be physically guarded and locked; access should be limited to 
authorized personnel only. For example, strategic placement of security guards may aide in 
the detection and deterrence of potential theft schemes. Electronic methods may also be 
used, such as cameras and surveillance devices. The effectiveness of any device will, 
however, depend on the employee’s knowledge that physical safeguard controls are adhered 
to and on the type of inventory available for misappropriation.
