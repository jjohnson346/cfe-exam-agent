Physical Padding 
Most methods of concealment deal with altering inventory records, either changing the 
perpetual inventory or miscounting during the physical inventory. In the alternative, some 
employees try to make it appear that there are more assets present in the warehouse or 
stockroom than there actually are. Empty boxes or boxes filled with bricks or other 
inexpensive materials, for example, may be stacked on shelves to create the illusion of extra 
inventory.
