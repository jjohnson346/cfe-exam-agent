NARRATIVE REPORT 
The narrative form includes all pertinent information about the area and the subject property 
as well as the rationale for the estimated value. It includes maps, photographs, charts, and 
plot plans. Financial institutions use narrative reports to support real estate lending and 
investment decisions on large commercial real estate transactions. Any other type of 
appraisal report (i.e., letter form or short form) on these complex transactions would likely 
be considered inadequate.
