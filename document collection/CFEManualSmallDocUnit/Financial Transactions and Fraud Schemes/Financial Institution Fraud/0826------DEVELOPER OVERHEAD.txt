DEVELOPER OVERHEAD 
It is not uncommon in construction financing to have a budget line item for developer 
overhead (also called general conditions ). This is a ripe area for abuse. The purpose of developer 
overhead is to supply the developer with operating capital while the project is under 
construction. This overhead allocation should not include a profit percentage, as the 
developer realizes profit upon completion. 
 
In essence, the overhead budget is as if the lender is making two types of loans: a real estate 
loan and a working capital loan for the overhead. Unfortunately, there is seldom, if ever, any 
separate underwriting for the overhead portion. The overhead is merely added as a 
construction cost, whose ultimate collateral is the property and not some other short-term 
collateral. Historically, troubled construction loans or foreclosures due to fraud have been 
totally disbursed in the developer overhead category.
