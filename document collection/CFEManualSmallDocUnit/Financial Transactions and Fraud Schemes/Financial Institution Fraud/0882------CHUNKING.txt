CHUNKING 
Chunking schemes typically involve an unsophisticated borrower who is recruited to purchase 
a property and who deals exclusively with a recruiter. The recruiter colludes with a mortgage 
broker who gathers the completed loan applications and submits them to multiple lenders 
for approval. The borrower may not even be aware that the recruiter and loan officer have 
submitted the application to multiple lenders. Multiple approvals are provided, all for the 
same property and all without knowing that other loans are being closed and funded 
simultaneously on the same property. 
 
The assistance of an appraiser and a title agent are usually required for a chunking scheme to 
be successful. The recruiter often acts as the borrower’s power of attorney (POA) in 
attending the multiple closings, and often is the one who pockets the loan proceeds over and 
above what is due to the legitimate property seller. The borrower is left with numerous loans 
from various lenders. Further, the lenders are not sufficiently collateralized, as there are 
multiple claims as first lien holder creditors.
