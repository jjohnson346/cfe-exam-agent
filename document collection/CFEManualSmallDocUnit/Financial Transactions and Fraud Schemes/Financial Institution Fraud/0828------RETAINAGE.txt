period has expired. There are at least two reasons why construction loans contain a retainage 
provision. The first reason is to keep the contractor’s interest in the project until all the work 
has been completed and accepted by the owner. The amount of the retainage represents 
part, if not all, of the contractor’s profit. Therefore, if the profit is not paid until the project 
has been completed, then presumably the contractor will complete the assignment on time 
and on budget. 
 
The second reason for the retainage is to ensure that the work of subcontractors is 
completed and that the general contractor pays the subcontractor so that no liens are filed. If 
the general contractor fails to pay the subcontractor then the subcontractor will probably file 
a lien on the project. If the retainage will not be released until such time as the lien period 
has expired, then there are at least some funds available to defray the cost of fighting the lien 
or making a duplicate payment because the general contractor might have embezzled the 
first payment without paying the subcontractor.
