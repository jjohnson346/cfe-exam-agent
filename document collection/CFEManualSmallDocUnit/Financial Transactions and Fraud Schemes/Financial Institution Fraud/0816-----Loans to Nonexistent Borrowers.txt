Financial Institution Fraud


:


Loans to Nonexistent Borrowers 
False applications, perhaps with inaccurate financial statements, are knowingly or 
unknowingly accepted by loan officers as the basis for loans. These types of loan fraud can 
be perpetrated by people either external to the lending institution (“external fraud”) or by 
officers, directors, or employees of the victim institution (“internal fraud”).
