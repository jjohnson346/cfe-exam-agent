A SCHEME INVOLVING A LEGITIMATE BUYER 
Some builders engaging in builder bailout schemes find marginal, legitimate buyers whose 
intent is to occupy the property and make the payments. The following is an example of this 
type of scheme: 
• The market value for a builder’s n ew construction home is $200,000. 
• A borrower wants to buy the house but does not have the necessary down payment (10 
percent, or $20,000).

• The builder offers to sell the house for $220,000 and provide silent seller financing. 
There is a verbal or undisclosed agreement that the silent second will be forgiven after 
closing. 
• The builder obtains an inflated appraisal for $220,000. This inflation is typically below 
fraud thresholds and just enough to create equity for the borrower. 
• The buyer is steered to a participating broker and title company. 
• The buyer qualifies for a 90-percent LTV ($200 ,000) which actually represents the true 
purchase or sale price. The buyer in these scenarios is often qualified for the loan based 
on material misrepresentations. 
• The buyer closes on a loan for $200,000. 
• The seller gets his original asking price of $200,000 and forgives the seller financing. 
• The lender now has a 100-percent LTV loan. 
• If the property goes into default, the lender has no equity, especially if the market 
continues to decline.
