Information Verification (For Example, Loan Applications) 
Fraud potential could be eliminated or at the very least detected before companies suffer 
damages if the employee knows how to verify information. For example, if the loan officer 
advises a potential borrower that the information submitted on financial statements will be 
verified, the borrower will be less likely to submit false or fraudulent financial statements. 
Additionally, if a teller advises a depositor that the deposit will be verified before cash is paid 
out, then the incidence of split deposits can be reduced.
