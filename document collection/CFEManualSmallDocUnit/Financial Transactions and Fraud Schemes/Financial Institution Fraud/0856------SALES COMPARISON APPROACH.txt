SALES COMPARISON APPROACH 
The sales comparison approach lends itself to the appraisal of land, residences, and other 
types of improvements that exhibit a high degree of similarity, and where a ready market 
exists. Compared to the other approaches, this method has great influence on residential 
portfolio valuations. This method is the least complicated to understand and apply.

Subject property is compared with similar property that is either offered for sale or has 
recently sold. Items evaluated include time of sale, location of sale (or offer for sale), physical 
characteristics, and improvements. Adjustments are made to the value of comparable 
properties (either plus or minus) on the basis of differences between them and the subject 
property. Relevant items might be an oversized lot, a view, a busy street, or access.
