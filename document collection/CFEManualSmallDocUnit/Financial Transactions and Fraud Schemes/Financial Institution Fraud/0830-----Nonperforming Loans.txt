Nonperforming Loans 
Although this information might not be available to all, a nonperforming loan is not 
performing for some reason. One of those reasons might be that a fraud scheme has or is 
occurring.  
 
Fraud schemes resulting in a nonperforming loan include: 
• Fraudulent appraisals — The cash flow cannot support an inflated loan and, therefore, debt 
amount. 
• False statements — The loan was made on false or fraudulently presented assumptions. 
• Equity skimming — There was never any intention to make the underlying loan payments. 
• Construction overbudget items — The overbudget amount might be a concealment method for 
other schemes such as embezzlement, misappropriation, or false statements. 
• Bribery — The loan was made because the lender received a bribe or a kickback from the 
borrower. 
• Land flips — The purpose of the loan was to finance the seller out of a property that has 
an artificially inflated value.

• Disguised transactions — Transactions that are sham transactions, without substance, made 
to conceal other ills.
