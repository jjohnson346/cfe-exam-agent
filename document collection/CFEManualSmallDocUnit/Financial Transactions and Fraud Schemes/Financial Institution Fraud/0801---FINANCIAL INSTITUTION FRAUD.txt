FINANCIAL INSTITUTION FRAUD 
 
Financial institutions include banks, savings and loans, credit unions, and other federally 
insured repositories. Financial institution fraud is also known by the more generic term of 
bank fraud. Check fraud and credit card fraud as it applies to both merchants and financial 
institutions is discussed in a separate chapter. 
 
A bank is defined as an organization engaged in any or all of many financial functions, such 
as receiving, collecting, transferring, paying, lending, investing, dealing, exchanging, and 
servicing (via safe deposit, custodianship, agency, or trusteeship) money and claims to 
money, both domestically and internationally. This broad concept applies to institutions such 
as central banks for cooperatives, export-import banks, federal intermediate credit banks, 
federal land banks, investment banks, and mortgage lenders.
