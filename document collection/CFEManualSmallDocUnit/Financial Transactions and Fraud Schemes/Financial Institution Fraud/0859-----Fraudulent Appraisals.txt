Fraudulent Appraisals 
Fraudulent appraisals result from any number of situations, some of which are: 
• Intentional use of an incompetent appraiser 
•  “Stacking the deck” by giving the appraiser improper or false assumptions to use in 
arriving at the value such as: 
? Assume zoning will be changed for a higher and better use when in fact zoning will 
not be changed. 
? Assume unrealistically high vacancy and low expense rates. 
? Assume unrealistically high income, selling prices, or absorption—the rate at which 
vacant space will become rented. 
? Otherwise influencing the appraiser, e.g., paying above-market fee or promising 
future business. 
? Direct collusion with the appraiser to commit fraud.
