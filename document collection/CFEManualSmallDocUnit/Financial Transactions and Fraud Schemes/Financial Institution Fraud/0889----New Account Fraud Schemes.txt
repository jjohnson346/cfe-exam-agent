New Account Fraud Schemes 
Fraud is much more likely to occur in new accounts than in established accounts. Special 
efforts must be taken to properly identify the potential new customer. Screening criteria 
should be established and enforced by everyone handling new accounts. Prompt, decisive 
action is necessary to manage and/or close apparent problem accounts.
