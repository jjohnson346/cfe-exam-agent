Detection Methods 
There are several methods by which embezzlement can be detected. Generally, if the dollar 
amount of the embezzlement scheme is small enough such that the financial statements will 
not be materially affected, embezzlement fraud can be most effectively detected through the 
review of source documents.  
 
If the scheme is so large that the financial statements of the institution are affected, then a 
review of the source documents will serve to confirm or refute an allegation that an 
embezzlement scheme has occurred, or is occurring. Generally, for large embezzlements, the 
most efficient method of detection is an analysis of the financial statements (which is also a 
review of documents).
