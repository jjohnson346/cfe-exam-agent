Builder-Bailout Schemes 
A builder bailout scheme usually occurs when a builder has sold the majority of homes in a 
tract, but is left with a few that are unsold. The builder may be suffering from financial 
difficulties with these lingering homes and may need to sell them quickly in order to pay off 
delinquent debts. To dispose of the remaining properties, the builder may undertake a 
variety of schemes that may include, but are not limited to, the use of hidden seller financing 
or inflated property values.  
 
Some builders also include lavish incentives in the transaction to lure buyers. Such incentives 
usually involve a form of down payment assistance so that a borrower can purchase a home 
without any equity contribution.  
 
Other concessions or incentives that might be offered to potential buyers include managing 
the properties as income-generating investment properties, absorbing any negative cash flow 
for the first 12 to 36 months, guaranteeing mortgage payments for the first 12 to 36 months, 
or other turnkey services and guarantees, even though the properties may remain vacant. 
Builders may also agree to pay the buyer a substantial rebate that is not disclosed to  
the lender.  
 
Getting concessions from the seller is not new and it is not necessarily fraudulent. The 
simple test to determine whether or not the transaction is illegal is to ask: Are these 
concessions disclosed and have they been approved by the lender?
