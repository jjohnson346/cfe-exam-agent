Nursing Homes 
Nursing homes have become a multibillion dollar business in the last few years. As such, 
they have become a common target of fraud. A wide array of providers — including durable 
medical equipment suppliers, laboratories, physicians, optometrists, and psychiatrists — have 
been involved in fraudulent or abusive billing for services and supplies furnished to nursing 
facility patients. Most fraudulent activity in volves billing for unnecessary or undelivered 
services, or misrepresenting a service to obtain reimbursement. 
 
There are several features unique to nursing homes that make them particularly vulnerable  
to fraud: 
• Unscrupulous billers of services can operate their schemes in volume because the 
patients are all located together under one roof. 
• In some instances, nursing homes make patient records available to outside providers 
who are not responsible for the direct care of the patient (contrary to federal 
regulations).

• Under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ reimbursement procedures, 
providers can bill Medicare directly without the nursing facility or attending physician 
affirming whether the items were necessary or provided as claimed. 
• Scrutiny of the claims at the processor level is inadequate because the automated claims 
systems used do not accumulate data that would timely flag indications of improbably 
high charges or levels of service. 
• Even when abusive practices are detected and prosecuted, repayment is rarely received 
from wrongdoers because they usually go out of business or deplete their resources so 
that they lack any resources to repay the funds. 
• Patient personal funds are controlled by nursing home administration and are an inviting 
target for embezzlement. Individually, patients generally maintain a relatively small 
balance in their personal funds accounts. Collectively, however, these funds generate a 
considerable source of income for an unscrupulous nursing home operator or employee.
