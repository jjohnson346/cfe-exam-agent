Fraud by the Medical Staff 
Employees of providers also have an opportunity to steal and cover up theft of cash. They 
can submit fraudulent claims for patients and divert the payments to themselves. If they are 
covered under insurance, they can also use their own contract to submit fraudulent claims. 
For many employees, care rendered by their employer (doctor) to them or their family is 
free, but claims may be filed and assignment not accepted. 
 
Another scheme involves the provider’s office calling in orders for unneeded prescription 
drugs to pharmacies. Once the drugs are picked up, they can be sold. For example, in a case 
involving collusion between a medical office employee and an elderly lady in a retirement 
community, the elderly lady had developed a business selling the drugs purchased from the 
employee to her friends and neighbors in her community. If the employee is in collusion 
with an insured, the fraudsters can collect not only from the sale of the drugs, but also from 
the proceeds of insurance claims.
