Detection 
• Excessive billings report may show that a provider is submitting large amounts of 
expenses. In addition, the claimant requests substantial payments to be made to him 
rather than the provider. 
• Explanation of benefits, if submitted to the provider, will probably generate some 
reaction from the provider. If substantial, at the time that Form 1099 is submitted to the 
provider, there may also be comments by the provider. 
• Periodically, management should compare the membership/enrollment file to the Social 
Security file to determine if the insurance company is paying claims on deceased 
insureds. The membership file also may be compared to the file from the vital statistics 
department to search for divorced policyholders.
