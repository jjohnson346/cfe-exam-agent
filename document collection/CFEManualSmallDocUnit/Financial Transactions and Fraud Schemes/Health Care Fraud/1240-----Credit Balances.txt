Credit Balances 
When patients have more than one payer responsible for payment of an admission, 
institutions have been known to collect more than the original amount billed. This may 
occur when the patient has more than one health insurance company, is in a vehicle accident 
where multiple insurance carriers are involved, or where workers’ compensation is 
applicable. In addition, the facility may also collect the deductible and co-payment from the 
patient. If the hospital has a credit balance, the amount paid above the charges should be 
refunded to the applicable parties. However, this does not always occur. Generally the 
refund will be made upon request, but only upon request.
