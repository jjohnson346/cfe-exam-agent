Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
As part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, 
Congress made a number of changes to the federal criminal code. In fact, the promulgation 
of HIPAA was the first massive sweep to wipe out health care fraud.  
 
The Act established several criminal statutes related specifically to health care fraud.  Under 
HIPAA, there are five federal crimes directed at health care fraud. Specifically, HIPAA made 
it illegal for anyone to knowingly and willfully: 
• Carry out a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program (18, U.S.C., § 1347) 
• Steal or embezzle any funds, property, or money of a health care benefit program (18, U.S.C., § 669) 
• Make false statements relating to health care matters (18, U.S.C., § 1035) 
• Obstruct a criminal investigations of a health care offense (18, U.S.C., § 1518)

More specifically, under section 1347, which establishes a federal offense of “health care 
fraud,” it is illegal for anyone to:  
• Knowingly and willfully  
• Executes, or attempts to execute  
• A scheme or artifice intended to 
? Defraud a health care benefit program, or 
? By false or fraudulent means, obtain money or property owned by, or under the 
custody or control of, any health care benefit program 
 
The term health care benefit program as used in these statutes is defined to mean “any public or 
private plan or contract, affecting commerce, under which any medical benefit, item, or 
service is provided to any individual, and includes any individual or entity who is providing a 
medical benefit, item, or service for which payment may be made under the plan  
or contract.” 
 
The Act also provides that a judge order a person convicted of a federal health care offense 
to forfeit any property that can be traced from the proceeds received from the offense. More 
information concerning these statutes is set out in the Law section. 
 
Moreover, pursuant to its purpose in providing funds to combat health care fraud, HIPAA 
launched the Fraud and Abuse Control Program, which: 
• Coordinates federal, state, and local law enforcement programs to control fraud and 
abuse as applicable to Medicaid programs;  
• Conducts investigations, audits, evaluations, and inspections as they relate to delivery and 
payment for Medicaid services;  
• Modifies and establishes Safe Harbor Provisions;  
• Issues advisory opinions and special fraud alerts; and  
• Provides reporting and disclosure requirements of adverse actions (under the Health 
Care Fraud and Abuse Data Collection Program).  
 
Furthermore, as part of the implementation of HIPAA, the Secretary of the Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS) was directed to create the Health Integrity and 
Protection Data Bank (HIPDB). The HIPDB is a reporting mechanism that allows users to 
access and review final adverse actions taken against practitioners, providers, and suppliers. 
Access to the data bank, however, is limited to federal and state government agencies and 
health plans.
