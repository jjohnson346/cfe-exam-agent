Regulatory Boards 
Since most medical practitioners are required to be licensed by their state to practice, the 
regulatory boards have jurisdiction over the licensees and can take action when appropriate. 
The regulatory boards will take action when the patient’s health is in jeopardy, fraud has 
been committed, continuing education requirements are not met, or other similar 
circumstances. In most instances, when a licensee is convicted of fraud, it is not automatic 
that his license is suspended or revoked. A separate action and investigation must be 
completed for that to happen. In many cases, however, when there is not enough evidence 
to sustain a criminal conviction, the licensing boards may be able to take action and offer 
relief.
