Payment for Referral of Patients 
Providers in an area of high competition will pay from $50 to $500 to cappers or runners  for 
recruiting new patients. In addition, patients may receive $50 if they refer a patient to a 
provider. The provider makes up for the kickback in the unnecessary billing of medical 
expenses or false claims. In addition, providers will pay kickbacks to other physicians for 
patient referrals.
