The Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute (42, U.S.C., § 1320a-7b(b)) 
The Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute (also known as the Federal Healthcare 
Anti-kickback Act) may also be used to combat healthcare fraud. This statute prohibits an 
individual from making payments to induce the purchase of healthcare goods or services that 
will be paid for by a federal health care program. Specifically, the statute prohibits: 
• The knowing and willful 
• Payment or receipt of any form of remuneration (including kickbacks, bribes, and 
rebates)  
• To induce someone to recommend or to purchase, order, or recommend any service that 
may be paid for under a federal health care program 
 
The statute encompasses a very broad array of activities that can be classified as Medicaid 
fraud. It applies to all federally funded health care programs, not just Medicaid.  
 
The statute criminally penalizes individuals who actually receive, as well as those who merely 
solicit, Medicaid remuneration. So long as the defendant’s intent is knowing and willful, and 
his means of involvement includes the receipt or solicitation of the kickback, the crime is 
prosecutable. But generally, it is difficult to determine whether the defendant intended to act 
knowingly and willfully, and neither “knowingly” nor “willfully” is defined in the statute. 
Thus, their interpretations are left for the courts to decipher, and this has inherently led to 
discrepancies in determining a defendant’s intent. 
 
The following examples are types of activities that typically violate the Medicare and 
Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute: 
• Payments for Medicaid patient referrals 
• Payments from a self-referral joint venture to investors for Medicaid patient referrals 
• Involvement in a consignment agreement, whereby performance under the agreement is 
based upon a percentage-based compensation scheme 
• A physician who performs little or no services to Medicaid patients yet receives large 
amounts of money for referring those patients to hospitals under ostensible services 
contracts
