HEALTH CARE FRAUD 
 
According to the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS), total health care 
expenditures are estimated to have reached approximately $2.5 trillion by the end of 2009, 
and are projected to rise to over $4.5 trillion by 2019 and comprise 19.3 percent of Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP). Per person health spending is expected to reach over $8,600 by 
the end of 2011 and is projected to increase to $13,400 by the end of 2019. 
 
Health care spending continues to increase much faster than the overall economy. This gap 
between health care spending and the overall economy is one of the main reasons that fraud 
in the health care industry is so prevalent. According to the U.S. Government Accountability 
Office (GAO), the most common estimate of health insurance fraud is 10 percent of our 
total health care spending. However, because no one knows exactly what the figure is, the 
figure has also been estimated to be from 3–10 percent per year. Health care providers 
perpetrate the majority of this fraud.
