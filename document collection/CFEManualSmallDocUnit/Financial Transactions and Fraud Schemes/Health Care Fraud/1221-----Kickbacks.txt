Health Care Fraud

Kickbacks 
Often hospitals are unaware (sometimes intentionally) of the extent of the fraud committed 
by revenue recovery firms. In other cases, however, revenue firms report that they will 
contact a hospital or nursing home directly and tell them that if the institution will give them 
their bills, they will split the profit produced by the added charges.
