Psychiatric Hospital Fraud 
Psychiatric hospitals are susceptible to fraud because of the very nature of mental health 
problems and the manner in which they are diagnosed and treated. Unlike the acute care 
field, it is often difficult to determine whether a person is in need of hospitalization for 
psychiatric treatment.
