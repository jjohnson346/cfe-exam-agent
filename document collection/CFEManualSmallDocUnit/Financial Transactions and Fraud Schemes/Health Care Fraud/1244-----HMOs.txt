HMOs 
HMOs, or Health Maintenance Organizations, have several variations. The HMO may 
employ all of the providers as in a staff-model HMO, or the managed care organization may 
contract with individual physicians or physician groups. The insured selects a primary care 
physician (PCP) who is the gatekeeper. Generally all medical care is initiated through the 
PCP. Payment is made by capitation, that is, the PCP receives a flat fee per month from the 
managed care organization, although some fees still may be paid on a fee-per-service basis 
usually at a reduced rate. Care that cannot be performed by the PCP is done by a specialty 
care physician who is also a member of the HMO network. The patient is severely penalized 
for going outside the HMO network.
