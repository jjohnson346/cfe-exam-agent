Write-Off of Patient Accounts 
When a patient account or other type of receivable has been determined to be uncollectible, 
the account is written-off to bad debts. It becomes a fraudulent transaction when the 
account has been written-off prematurely and the balance subsequently collected with the 
proceeds going to the employee. In this scheme, the employee has the opportunity to collect 
the receivable and divert the funds to himself, because companies typically do not keep track 
of old, written-off accounts receivable. 
 
Often old accounts receivable are assigned to a collection agency. These agencies typically 
are paid on a percentage of the collected amounts. Fraud schemes can be perpetrated by

these agencies if the company does not monitor the method by which the agency receives 
old accounts and the collection process itself.  
 
The assignor company needs to assure itself that the collection agency is being assigned truly 
old accounts only and not good accounts that can reasonably be expected to pay within the 
normal course of business.  
 
Additionally, the company needs to be sure that the collection agency cannot compromise 
the indebtedness so that collections are not reported. This would allow the collection agency 
to compromise indebtedness for its own collection and not remit amounts owed the 
company.
