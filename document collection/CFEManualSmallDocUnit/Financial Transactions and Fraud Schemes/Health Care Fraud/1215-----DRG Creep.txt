DRG Creep 
Diagnostic Related Groupings (DRG) is a reimbursement methodology for the payment of 
institutional claims. It is a patient classification scheme that categorizes patients who are 
medically related with respect to primary and secondary diagnosis, age, and complications. 
Reimbursements are determined by the DRG. For example, a heart bypass operation is 
worth a certain amount of reimbursement and a hernia repair is worth a different amount. 
DRG creep occurs when a hospitalization is coded as a more complex admission than 
occurred. When it becomes a pattern and intent is established, it becomes fraud.

Another type of fraud using DRG codes involves billing for the DRG code and then billing 
again for services that were included in the DRG payment.
