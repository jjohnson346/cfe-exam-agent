False Claims and Statements 
Though there is a statute specifically designed to combat false claims in connection with 
health care benefits programs, the federal false claims statutes may be used to combat certain 
types of health care fraud. Some examples of false claims and statements include: 
• Falsified contractor qualifications 
• False certifications or assurances 
• False records or invoices 
• Invoices from nonexistent companies 
• Claims made in duplicate or altered invoices 
• Billing for fictitious employees 
• Billing for goods and services not provided 
• Inflated costs or substitution of cheaper goods 
 
Although these statutes are discussed in more detail in the Law section of the Fraud 
Examiners Manual, this discussion will provide a brief overview of the main false claims and 
statements statutes used to combat health care fraud, including: false statements under 
section 1001, the criminal False Claims Act, and the Civil False Claims Act.
