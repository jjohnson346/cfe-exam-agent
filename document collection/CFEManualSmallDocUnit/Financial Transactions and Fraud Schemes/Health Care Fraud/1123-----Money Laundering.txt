Money Laundering 
The money laundering statutes may also be effective in deterring and punishing individuals 
who commit health care fraud. Section 1956 of Title 18, U.S. Code, criminalizes financial 
transactions involving proceeds of unlawful activity. Property qualifies as the proceeds of 
illegal activity if it is derived from a “specified unlawful activity,” which HIPAA amended to 
include health care offenses.  
 
Using the federal money laundering statutes is beneficial because they allow the government 
to seize property through civil forfeiture (i.e., the government may seize property before 
judgment to ensure it will be secure until a hearing can be held). 
 
The text of the money laundering statutes can be found in the Law section of the Fraud 
Examiners Manual.
