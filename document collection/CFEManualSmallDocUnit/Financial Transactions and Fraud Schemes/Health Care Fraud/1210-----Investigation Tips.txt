Investigation Tips 
• The claim file should be reviewed to determine if the charges are legitimate. 
• Determine if the medical language appears to be proper by comparing samples of bona 
fide claims. 
• It may be necessary to submit a letter to the attending physician to determine if the 
charges are correct. 
• Through law enforcement contacts, it may be necessary to obtain information regarding 
the legitimacy of the claim. 
• Check the style of the date. In many foreign countries, dates are listed with the day first, 
then the month and year, e.g., 07/01/08 would be 7 January 2008. If the U.S. style of 
dating is used (month/day/year), it may indicate a fraudulent claim.
