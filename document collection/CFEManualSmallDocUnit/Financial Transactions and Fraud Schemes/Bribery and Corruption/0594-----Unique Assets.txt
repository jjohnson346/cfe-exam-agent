Unique Assets 
Not all conflict schemes occur in the traditional vendor-buyer relationship. Sometimes 
schemes involve employees negotiating for the purchase of some unique, typically large asset 
such as land or a building in which the employee had an undisclosed interest. It is in the 
process of these negotiations that the fraudster violates his duty of loyalty to his employer. 
Because he stands to profit from the sale of the asset, the employee does not negotiate in 
good faith to his employer; he does not attempt to get the best price possible. The fraudster 
will reap a greater financial benefit if the purchase price is high.  
 
For example, an employee in charge of negotiating mineral leases on land that he secretly 
owns is obviously in a position of compromise. There will be no financial motive for this 
employee to negotiate a favorable lease on behalf of his employer.
