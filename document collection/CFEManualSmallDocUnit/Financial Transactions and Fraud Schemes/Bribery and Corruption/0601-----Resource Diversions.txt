Resource Diversions 
Some employees divert the funds and other resources of their employers to the development 
of their own business. This kind of scheme involves elements of both conflicts of interest 
and fraudulent disbursements. 
 
EXAMPLE 
A vice president of a company authorized large expenditures to develop a unique type of 
new equipment used by a certain contractor. Another firm subsequently took over the 
contractor, as well as the new equipment. Shortly after that, the vice president retired and 
went to work for the firm that had bought out the contractor. The fraudster had managed 
to use his employer’s money to fund a company in which he eventually developed an interest.  
 
While these schemes are clearly corruption schemes, the funds are diverted through the use 
of a fraudulent disbursement. The money could be drained from the victim organization 
through a check tampering scheme, a billing scheme, a payroll scheme, or an expense 
reimbursement scheme. For a discussion of the methods used to generate fraudulent 
disbursements, please refer to the Asset Misappropriation section.
