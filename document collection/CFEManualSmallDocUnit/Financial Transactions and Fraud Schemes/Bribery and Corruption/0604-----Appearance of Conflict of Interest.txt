Appearance of Conflict of Interest 
A final type of conflict of interest is the appearance of such. Examples include ownership in a 
blind trust, in which the employee has no authority to make investment decisions, or an 
external auditor owning a minority interest in a company that is audited by the auditor’s firm. 
Such matters are rarely prosecuted as criminal offenses.
