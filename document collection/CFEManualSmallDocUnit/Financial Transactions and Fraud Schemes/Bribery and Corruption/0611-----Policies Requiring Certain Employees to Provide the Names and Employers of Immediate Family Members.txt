Policies Requiring Certain Employees to Provide the Names and Employers of Immediate Family Members 
Where acceptable by law, a productive audit test may be to require members of management, 
as well as members of the procurement department, to provide detailed information 
regarding the names and employers of all immediate family members and household 
members. Comparing the names and employers of family members to the current position 
of the employee may lead to information that would require further investigation to 
determine whether a conflict of interest exists.
