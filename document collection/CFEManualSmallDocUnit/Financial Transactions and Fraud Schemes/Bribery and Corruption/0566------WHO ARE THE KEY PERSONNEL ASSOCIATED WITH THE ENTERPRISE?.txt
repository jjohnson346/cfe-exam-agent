WHO ARE THE KEY PERSONNEL ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENTERPRISE? 
This helps to identify potential witnesses and informants, as well as possible subjects. Key 
positions include the owners of the business; the people directly involved in the suspect 
transactions, including secretarial and clerical staff, present and former employees; the 
“number crunchers”; the bookkeeper, outside accountants, and tax preparers; outside 
consultants, sales representatives, and independent contractors (a popular conduit for 
payoffs); and competitors (often eager witnesses who can identify leads to sources of off-
 book funds such as customers and rebate practices).
