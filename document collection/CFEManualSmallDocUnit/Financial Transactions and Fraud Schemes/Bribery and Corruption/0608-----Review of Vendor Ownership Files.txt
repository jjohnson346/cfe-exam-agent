Review of Vendor Ownership Files 
When a vendor is selected, a complete file of the ownership of that vendor should be kept. 
This is particularly important for closely held businesses. If the vendor is required to update 
the file annually then changes in ownership will also be disclosed. A computer comparison 
of the vendor ownership and the employee file may reveal conflicts of interest.
