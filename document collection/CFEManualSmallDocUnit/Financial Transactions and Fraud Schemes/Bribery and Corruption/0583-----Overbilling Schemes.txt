Overbilling Schemes 
As described above, illicit funds might be added to legitimate payments for goods or services 
provided by actual suppliers, subcontractors, engineers, and agents, with the additional 
amounts being passed on by the supplier or returned to the payer (usually in cash) for 
distribution. 
 
Obtain the same records required for tracing phony payables—bank account information, 
backup documentation, and accounting records—from both the original payer and the 
intermediary. Note the following indicators of suspect payments to the intermediary: 
• Notations on invoices or other billing documents breaking out “extra” or “special” 
charges, particularly those that require no delivery of goods for payment. 
• Discrepancies between the purchase order or invoice amounts and the amount of 
payment. Particularly note invoices that appear to have been altered or copied. 
• Unusually large amounts appearing on particular bills, or bills that break a consistent 
pattern of amounts, schedule, or purpose. 
 
Disbursements from the intermediary might be covered in the same ways as in other on-
 book schemes, such as by means of phony payables, direct cash withdrawals, or 
disbursements charged to miscellaneous accounts, such as travel or entertainment. The 
tracing process is the same as in any on-book scheme. Remember that the overbilling entity 
will usually add its own fee for providing such services. Therefore, the disbursements 
coming from its account might not be in the same amount as the additional payments made 
to it.
