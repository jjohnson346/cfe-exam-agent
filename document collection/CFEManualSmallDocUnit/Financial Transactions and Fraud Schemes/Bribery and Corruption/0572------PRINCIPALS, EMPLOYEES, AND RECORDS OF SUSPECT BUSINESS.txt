PRINCIPALS, EMPLOYEES, AND RECORDS OF SUSPECT BUSINESS 
People suspected of making illegal payments might submit to an interview, particularly if 
they are confident that the payments are well hidden. Interviews should also include other 
key employees (including the financial personnel) involved in the suspect transactions, 
particularly those who have since left the company. Use the Business Profile as a guide to 
questioning.
