Investigation in the Marketplace 
Customers of the suspect business whose payments might have been diverted to off-book 
accounts might have records, including canceled checks, which would reflect such sales, and 
the bank and account to which the funds were deposited. Customers might also reveal cash 
payments that could be used to create a slush fund. Additionally, competitors might be 
aware of other customers and transactions that could lead to evidence of off-book sales.
