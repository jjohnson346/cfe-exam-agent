Economic Extortion 
Economic extortion cases are the “Pay up or else …” corruption schemes; basically the flip 
side of bribery schemes. Instead of a vendor offering a payment to influence a decision, an 
employee demands that a vendor pay him in order to make a decision in that vendor’s favor. 
If the vendor refuses to pay, he faces some harm such as a loss of business with the 
extorter’s company. In any situation where an employee might accept bribes to favor a 
particular company or person, the situation could be reversed to a point where the employee 
extorts money from a potential purchaser or supplier.  
 
EXAMPLE 
A plant manager for a utility company started his own business on the side. Vendors who 
wanted to do work for the utility company were  forced by the manager to divert some of 
their business to his own compan y. Those that did not “play ball” lost their business with 
the utility.
