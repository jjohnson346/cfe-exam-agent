Interviews of Purchasing Personnel for Favorable Treatment of One or More Vendors 
Employees are generally the first to observe that a vendor is receiving favorable treatment. 
Therefore, by asking employees if any vendor is receiving favorable treatment, the examiner 
may discover conflicts of interest that would otherwise have gone unnoticed. Another 
question that may be asked of employees is whether any vendor’s service (or product) has 
recently become substandard.
