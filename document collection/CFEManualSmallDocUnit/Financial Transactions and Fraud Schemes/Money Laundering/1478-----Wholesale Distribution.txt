Wholesale Distribution 
Wholesale distribution businesses have historically been a prominent part of money 
laundering. The revenues in a wholesaling business are not typically as flexible as in food 
service and vending machine operations, but with a diverse product line and falsified 
invoices, it is still possible to inject a good deal of illegal cash into the business. More 
importantly, the industry is ideal for money laundering from the standpoint of expenses. The 
activities required to run this kind of business are so diverse and difficult to measure that 
expenses are easy to inflate. Furthermore, a wholesale business’s buildings, warehouses, 
transportation fleet, and its contact with retail establishments are all attractive factors. Many 
of the classic criminal activities (such as drugs, fencing, and contraband) are themselves 
nothing more than distribution operations and can hide behind this type of business cover.
