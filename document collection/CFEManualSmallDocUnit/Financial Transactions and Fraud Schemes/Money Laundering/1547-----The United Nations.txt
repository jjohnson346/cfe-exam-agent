The United Nations 
In 1988, the UN adopted the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and 
Psychotropic Substances, a mandate to bring an end to money laundering. In response, the 
UN established the Global Programme against Money-Laundering (GPML), which provides 
member states with assistance in complying with international AML standards. In addition, 
the GPML, in participation with other international organizations, maintains the 
International Money Laundering Information Ne twork (IMoLIN), a website that provides 
the international community with information and tools concerning AML.
