MORTGAGE SCHEMES 
Often, money launderers will use illicit funds to pay the interest or repay the principal on 
mortgage loans, and in so doing, the illicit income is converted into seemingly legitimate 
profits when the property is sold. Mortgage schemes also involve under- and over-valuation 
of property. For example, in a common under-valuation scheme, a money launderer will 
under-value the purchase price of property, obtain a mortgage loan for the under-valued 
amount, use the loan to pay for the under-valued price, and pay the excess amount under the 
table with illicit funds.
