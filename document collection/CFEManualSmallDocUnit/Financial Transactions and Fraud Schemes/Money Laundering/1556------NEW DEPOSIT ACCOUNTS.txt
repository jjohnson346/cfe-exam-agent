The customer should be required to submit some form of identification that includes a 
photo such as a driver’s license or passport, and a copy should be made and kept in the

the employee should be instructed to notify the appropriate department. 
Minimum standards for new business accounts should include:

The account representative should also consider making a personal visit to the customer’s
