LONG-ARM JURISDICTION OVER FOREIGN MONEY LAUNDERERS 
Section 1956(b) also gives U.S. district courts jurisdiction over foreign persons or financial 
institutions when (1) the foreign person commits a money laundering offense under section 
1956(a) that occurs in whole or in part in the United States; (2) the foreign person converts 
to his own use property in which the United States has an ownership interest; or (3) the 
foreign financial institution maintains a bank account in the United States.  
 
Under section 1956(b)(3), a U.S. court can issue restraining orders to freeze the assets of 
foreign money launderers described above prior to trial to ensure that the defendant’s assets 
are available to satisfy a judgment. The court can also appoint a Federal Receiver to collect, 
marshal, and take control of the defendant’s assets to satisfy a civil or criminal judgment for 
money laundering, or a civil or criminal forfeiture judgment.
