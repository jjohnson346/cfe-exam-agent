Calling in a Specialist 
Converting ill-gotten gains into cashier’s checks or money orders is not particularly difficult 
for even the most unsophisticated criminal. However because many launderers fear 
detection, they turn to more sophisticated specialists. Couriers  arrange for the transportation 
of money to a site where it is converted into another form of currency. For instance, drug 
traffickers will physically transport money to a foreign jurisdiction where it is deposited into 
a bank account or converted directly to checks or money orders. Since the courier has no 
apparent connection with the true owner of the funds, the money launderer retains  
his anonymity.  
 
White-collar professionals, such as attorneys, accountants, and brokers, might also serve to 
launder illegal funds. Through investments, trust accounts, fund transfers, and tax avoidance 
schemes these professionals can manipulate the financial, commercial, and legal systems to 
conceal the origin and ownership of assets.
