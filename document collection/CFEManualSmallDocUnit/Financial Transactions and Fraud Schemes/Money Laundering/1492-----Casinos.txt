Casinos 
Casinos operate in a high-volume cash-intensive industry and provide a broad range of 
financial services (such as deposit and credit accounts, funds transfers, check cashing, and 
currency exchange services) outside the traditional financial services system. As a result, 
casinos are susceptible to money laundering.  
 
According to the 2005 U.S. Money Laundering Threat Assessment, criminals typically 
launder money through casinos by exchanging illicit cash for casino chips and then either: 
• Holding the chips for a period of time and later cashing them in for a casino check or 
having the casino wire the money elsewhere;

• Using the chips as currency to purchase narcotics, with the drug dealer later cashing in 
the chips; or, 
• Using the chips to gamble in hopes of generating certifiable winnings.
