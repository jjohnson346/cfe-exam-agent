Money Laundering


:


Bars, Restaurants, and Night Clubs 
Businesses that are commonly used to front money laundering operations include bars, 
restaurants, and nightclubs. These businesses charge relatively high prices, and customers 
vary widely in their purchases. Sales are generally in cash, and it is notoriously difficult to 
match the cost of providing food, liquor, and entertainment with the revenues they produce. 
Fast food restaurants are also frequently used to front for money laundering operations. 
Although they tend to charge lower prices than other types of restaurants, most of their sales 
are made in cash, and expenses can be easily inflated.
