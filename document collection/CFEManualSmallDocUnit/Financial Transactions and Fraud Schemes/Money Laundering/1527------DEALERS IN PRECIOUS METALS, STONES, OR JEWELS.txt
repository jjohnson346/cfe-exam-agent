DEALERS IN PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, OR JEWELS 
Persons who deal in jewels, precious metals, and precious stones are required to establish 
anti-money laundering programs. “Dealers” are defined as persons who have purchased at 
least $50,000 and  sold more than $50,000 worth of jewels, stones, or metals during the 
preceding year. Additionally, the person must also be in the business of selling significant 
amounts of such items; therefore, the rule wo uld not apply to occasional sellers or hobbyists. 
Dealers, however, are not required to file SARs. FinCEN is developing a set of final rules to 
address in more detail who is covered under the rule and what procedures will be required.
