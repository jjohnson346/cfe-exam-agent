Special Due Diligence for Foreign Accounts 
Section 312 of the PATRIOT Act requires financ ial institutions to establish due diligence 
policies, procedures, and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances 
of money laundering through certain accounts held by non-U.S. citizens or their 
representatives. This provision applies to two types of foreign accounts:  
• Private banking accounts  
• Correspondent accounts  
 
A private banking account is defined by the Act as an account (or combination of accounts) that 
(1) requires a minimum aggregate deposit of funds or other assets of at least $1 million; (2) is

established on behalf of one or more individuals who have a direct or beneficial ownership 
in the account; and (3) is assigned to or admini stered by an officer, employee, or agent of the 
financial institution acting as a liaison between the financial institution and the owner of the 
account. 
 
For private banking accounts held by non-U.S. persons, the Act requires at a minimum that 
financial institutions take reasonable steps to:  
• Ascertain the identity of the nominal and beneficial owners of the account, and the 
source of funds deposited into the account as needed to guard against money laundering 
and report any suspicious transactions; and  
• Conduct enhanced scrutiny of any such account that is requested or maintained by, or 
on behalf of, a senior foreign political figure (or an immediate family member or close 
associate of such) that is reasonably designed to detect and report transactions that may 
involve the proceeds of foreign corruption. 
 
A correspondent account is defined as an account established to receive deposits from or make 
payments on behalf of a foreign financial institution, or handle other financial transactions 
related to such an institution. Enhanced due diligence is required for correspondent accounts 
maintained by or on behalf of foreign banks that operate under off-shore banking licenses or 
for banks that are licensed by foreign countries that have either been designated as 
noncooperative with international anti-money laundering principles or that have been 
designated by the Secretary of the Treasury as warranting special measures due to money 
laundering concerns. Enhanced due diligence for these correspondent accounts consists of, 
at a minimum:  
• Ascertaining the identity of the owners of any foreign bank whose shares are not  
publicly traded; 
• Determining the nature and extent of each owner’s interest; 
• Conducting enhanced scrutiny of the account to guard against money laundering and 
report suspicious transactions; and 
• Ascertaining whether the foreign bank provides correspondent accounts to other  
foreign banks and, if so, the identity of those foreign banks and related due  
diligence information.
