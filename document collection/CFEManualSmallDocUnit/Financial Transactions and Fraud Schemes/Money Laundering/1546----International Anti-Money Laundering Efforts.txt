International Anti-Money Laundering Efforts 
In the 1980s, the mounting global drug crisis led to the birth of international anti-money 
laundering (AML) efforts. As a result, international organizations began taking on initiatives 
to fight money laundering while others were created for that same purpose. The principal 
organizations include the United Nations (UN), the Financial Action Task Force on Money 
Laundering (FATF), and the Egmont Group. Fo llowing the events of September 11, 2001, 
however, the international community’s AML focus shifted from anti-drugs to anti-terrorism 
and many international organizations revised the AML framework to not only examine 
funds from illegal sources but to also examine funds whose purposes were illegitimate.
