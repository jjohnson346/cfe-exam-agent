Banks and Other Depository Financial Institutions 
Banks and other depository institutions are susceptible to individuals attempting to launder 
illicit funds because they are the primary gateway to the U.S. financial system. Once placed in 
a depository institution, illegal proceeds can be transferred instantly by wire or disguised by 
commingling with legitimate funds. A challenge currently faced by depository institutions 
includes money launderers concealing their identities and sources of income to open 
accounts and launder illegal proceeds. Additionally, the increasing use of the Internet to 
open or access accounts make it difficult for depository institutions to verify customers’ 
identification.
