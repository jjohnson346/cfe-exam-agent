Unit of Measure 
All financial reports are based on the monetary unit, e.g., the dollar for U.S. entities. This 
assumption recognizes that the monetary unit is an effective means of communicating 
financial information. Adjustments for inflationary trends are not shown in the financial 
statements of the entity.
