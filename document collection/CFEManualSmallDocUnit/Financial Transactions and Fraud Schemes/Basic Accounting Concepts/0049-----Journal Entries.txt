Journal Entries  
As transactions occur, they are recorded in a company’s books via journal entries. Each journal 
entry serves as a record of a particular transaction and forms an audit trail that can be 
retraced later for an understanding of a company’s operations. Journal entries that are not 
triggered by a transaction, called adjusting journal entries, are also made periodically for items 
such as depreciation expense and accounts receivable write-offs.
