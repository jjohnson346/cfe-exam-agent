Substance over Form 
The economic substance of a transaction determines the accounting treatment, which may 
differ from the legal treatment. For example, although a lease contract may not transfer 
property rights, if the true substance of the transaction is a sale, then the lessee should 
record the transaction as an acquisition and capitalize the property.
