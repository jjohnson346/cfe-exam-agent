Statement of Owners’ Equity 
The statement of owners’ equity details the changes in the total owners’ equity amount listed 
on the balance sheet. Because it shows how the amounts on the income statement flow 
through to the balance sheet, it acts as the connecting link between the two statements. The 
balance of the owners’ equity at the beginning of the year is the starting point for the 
statement. The transactions that affect owners’ equity are listed next and added together. 
The result is added to (or subtracted from, if negative) the beginning-of-the-year balance, 
which provides the end-of-the-year balance for total owners’ equity.

The statement of owners’ equity for XYZ Company would appear as follows:  
 
XYZ Company 
Statement of Owners’ Equity 
For the Year Ended December 31, 20XX  
  
Owners’ equity, January 1, 20XX  $              -  
Investment by owners during the year  $      192,000  
Net income for the year 8,000  
Increase in owners’ equity 200,000  
Owners’ equity, December 31, 20XX  $      200,000  
 
XYZ Company completed two types of transactions that affected the owners’ equity during 
20XX: the $192,000 invested by the company’s shareholders, and the revenue and expenses 
that resulted in the net income of $8,000. Had the company distributed any money to the 
shareholders in the form of dividends, that amount would be listed on the statement of 
owners’ equity as well. Notice that the $8,000 ties directly to the bottom line of the income 
statement, and the $200,000 owners’ equity ties to the “total owners’ equity” amount on the 
balance sheet.  
 
Some companies present a statement of retained earnings rather than a statement of owners’ 
equity. Similar to the statement of owners’ equity,  the statement of retained earnings starts 
with the retained earnings balance at the beginning of the year. All transactions affecting the 
retained earnings account are then listed and added to the beginning balance to arrive at the 
ending balance in the retained earnings account. Below is an example of the statement of 
retained earnings for XYZ Company:  
 
XYZ Company 
Statement of Retained Earnings 
For the Year Ended December 31, 20XX  
   
Retained earnings, January 1, 20XX  $              -   
Net income for the year  $         8,000  
Increase in owners’ equity 8,000  
Retained earnings, December 31, 20XX  $         8,000
