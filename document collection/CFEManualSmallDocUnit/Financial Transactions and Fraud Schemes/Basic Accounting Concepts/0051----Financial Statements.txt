Financial Statements 
The results of the accounting process are reports, or financial statements, that exemplify the 
financial position and operating results of an entity. Financial statements are often the 
vehicles through which fraud occurs. 
 
According to AU section 623, Special Reports, promulgated by the AICPA’s Auditing 
Standards Board, financial statements include presentations of financial data and 
accompanying notes prepared in conformity with either generally accepted accounting 
principles or some other comprehensive basis of accounting. The following is a list of such 
financial statements: 
• Balance sheet 
• Statement of income or statement of operations 
• Statement of retained earnings 
• Statement of cash flows 
• Statement of changes in owners’ equity 
• Statement of assets and liabilities that does not include owners’ equity accounts 
• Statement of revenue and expenses 
• Summary of operations 
• Statement of operations by product lines 
• Statement of cash receipts and disbursements 
 
Although not specifically noted in AU section 623, financial statements may also include 
other financial data presentations, such as: 
• Prospective financial information (forecasts)

• Proxy statements 
• Interim financial information (for example, quarterly financial statements) 
• Current value financial presentations 
• Personal financial statements (current or present value) 
• Bankruptcy financial statements 
• Registration statement disclosures (Securities Act of 1933) 
 
Other comprehensive bases of accounting, according to AU section 623, include: 
• Government or regulatory agency accounting 
• Tax-basis accounting 
• Cash receipts and disbursements, or modified cash receipts and disbursements 
• Any other basis with a definite set of criteria applied to all material items, such as the 
price-level basis of accounting 
 
Consequently, the term financial statements  includes almost any financial data presentation 
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or another 
comprehensive basis of accounting. Throughout this section, the term financial statements 
will include the above forms of reporting financial data, including the accompanying 
footnotes and management’s discussion. For most companies, however, a full set of financial 
statements comprises a balance sheet, a statement of income, a statement of owners’ equity 
or a statement of retained earnings, and a statement of cash flows. Therefore, fraud 
examiners should be familiar with the purpose and components of each of these financial 
statements.
