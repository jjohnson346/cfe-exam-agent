Balance Sheet 
The balance sheet shows a “snapshot” of a company’s financial situation at a specific point in 
time, generally the last day of the accounting period. The balance sheet is an expansion of 
the accounting equation, assets = liabilities + owners’ equity. That is, it lists a company’s assets 
on one side and its liabilities and owners’ equity on the other side. The nature of the 
accounting equation means that the two sides of the statement should balance, hence the 
name “balance sheet.”  
 
The following balance sheet, derived from the journal entries in the above example, shows 
the financial position of XYZ Company on the last day of its first year of operations.

As mentioned, assets are the resources owned by a company. Generally, assets are presented 
on the balance sheet in order of liquidity, or how soon they are expected to be converted to 
cash. The first section on the assets side, current assets, includes all those assets that are 
expected to be converted to cash, sold, or used up within one year. This category usually 
includes cash, accounts receivable (the amount owed to a company by customers for sales 
on credit), inventory, and prepaid items. Following the current assets are the long-term assets, 
or those assets that will likely not be converted to cash in the near future, such as fixed assets 
(e.g., land, buildings, equipment) and intangible assets (e.g., patents, trademarks, goodwill). A 
company’s fixed assets are presented net of accumulated depreciation, an amount that 
represents the cumulative expense taken for wear-and-tear on a company’s property. 
Likewise, intangible assets are presented net of accumulated amortization, an amount that 
represents the collective expense taken for declines in value of the intangible property. 
 
Liabilities are presented in order of maturity. Like current assets, current liabilities  are those 
obligations that are expected to be paid within one year, such as accounts payable (the 
amount owed to vendors by a company for purchases on credit), accrued expenses (e.g., 
taxes payable or salaries payable), and the portion of long-term debts that will come due

within the next year. Those liabilities that are not due for more than a year are listed under 
the heading long-term liabilities. The most common liabilities in this group are bonds, notes, 
and mortgages payable. The total balance of the note payable is listed under long-term 
liabilities on XYZ Company’s balance sheet, indicating that it does not have to make any 
payments on the note during the next year. However, if a $5,000 payment was required 
during the next year, the company would have to reclassify $5,000 of the note balance to the 
current liabilities section and show the remaining $70,000 as a long-term liability. This 
adjustment would not change the total amount of the outstanding liability that was shown — all 
$75,000 would still appear on the balance sheet - but it would allow financial statement 
users to know that the company had an obligation to pay $5,000 during the next year rather 
than at some unspecified time in the future.  
 
The owners’ equity in a firm generally represents amounts from two sources — owner 
contributions (usually referred to as common or capital stock, and paid-in capital) and 
undistributed earnings (usually referred to as retained earnings). The balance in the capital stock 
account increases when the owners of a company invest in it through the purchase of 
company stock. The retained earnings balance increases when a company has earnings and 
decreases when a company has losses. The retained earnings account is also decreased when 
earnings are distributed to a company’s owners in the form of dividends, or when a company 
has losses. XYZ Company’s balance sheet shows that the company’s owners have 
contributed $192,000 to the company and that the company has retained $8,000 of earnings 
as of December 31, 20XX.
