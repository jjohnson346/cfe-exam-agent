Modeling Schools 
Modeling schools appeal to the vanity of some people. In the typical scheme, the modeling 
school representative tells the prospective student that he will prepare a portfolio of portraits 
to be sent to potential customers who may employ the victim as a model. The victim is then 
charged an inflated price for the pictures. Con game modeling schools often claim —
 inaccurately — connections to famous people and maintain that they have been instrumental 
in starting the careers of successful models. The schools sometimes target parents and 
grandparents with lures of the money that can be earned by their “exceptionally pretty” 
infant children or grandchildren.
