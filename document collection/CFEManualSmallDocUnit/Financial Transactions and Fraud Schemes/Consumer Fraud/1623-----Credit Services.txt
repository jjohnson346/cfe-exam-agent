Credit Services 
The simplest credit scam promises that the company will secure a loan for the applicant, 
regardless of credit history and references, if the person pays an upfront fee, usually between 
$35 and $75. Checking account debits are a favorite payment method, as are 900 numbers, 
which charge by the minute (up to $40 or $50 per call) to hear information widely available 
that provides no help in swaying a loan for the listener. Usually there are few or no loans 
made. Occasionally, loan information and applications may be mailed out to the victim, but 
usually, after the fee has been paid, the operators are not heard from again.
