800 Numbers 
Toll-free 800 numbers (or other toll-free prefixes, such as 866, 877, or 888) offered by 
phone service companies are used by some operations. The scam is a toll-free line, 
advertised in mailers, fliers, and newspaper ads, to lure victims into making the call 
themselves. The toll-free number usually carries a recording that directs customers to a 900 
number that charges the caller between $3 and $10 a minute to hear recorded messages. A 
favorite device of sellers is to insist that the offer being made is good for less than 48 hours. 
To secure the opportunity, the customer hands over a cashier’s check to an overnight-delivery 
service. Even if the victim does have second thoughts, he will be unable to stop 
payment on a cashier’s check.
