Turnkeys 
Turnkeys comprise an industry of their own by providing the collateral a telemarketing scam 
needs: turnkeys launder credit card receipts and checks, sell autodialers and phone lists, and 
provide the merchandise portrayed as valuable prizes.  
 
Legitimate businesses, however, are routinely implicated in this scurrilous industry. The U.S. 
Postal Service, for instance, carries tons of telemarketing ads. In the early days of the 
industry, telemarketers used the Postal Service to deliver merchandise C.O.D., but when the 
postal service mounted an aggressive campaign against fraud, companies turned to credit 
card billings to avoid the scrutiny. They also use parcel delivery services or overnighters, 
which are not subject to federal mail fraud laws. By keeping the value of the merchandise 
just below $300, telemarketers avoid the minimum amount at which postal inspectors are 
required to investigate fraud.
