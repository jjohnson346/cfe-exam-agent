Telemarketing Suppliers 
The telemarketing industry relies on a number of sources to supply its phone scripts, mailing 
lists, merchandise, phone banks, and autodialers. Mailing lists and phone lists are sold for a 
few cents per name. Lists of people who have been stung before or who have bad credit 
records fetch between 10 and fifteen cents per name. By supplying telemarketers with the 
tools of their trade, these companies make telescamming possible. Many of the suppliers are 
aware of telemarketers’ criminal intentions and choose to ignore them.
