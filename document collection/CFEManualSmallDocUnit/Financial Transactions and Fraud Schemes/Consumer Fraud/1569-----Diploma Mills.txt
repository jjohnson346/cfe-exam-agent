Diploma Mills 
For what is often a hefty fee, a diploma can be purchased by those who apply. The fraudster 
usually claims that the fee is for processing the application or for verifying the experience 
necessary for the degree to be awarded. The hallmark of the diploma mill is the ease with 
which the degree is obtained, though the degree, because the school is not accredited, is 
essentially worthless. 
 
Correspondence schools may also operate with the same modus operandi as diploma mills. 
Investigators have at times submitted the scribblings of their infant children to schools that 
advertise that they will provide art lessons to persons who demonstrate talent; usually the 
infants’ “drawings” are judged to show considerable ability, and the submitter is asked to 
send a fee to begin receiving the lessons.
