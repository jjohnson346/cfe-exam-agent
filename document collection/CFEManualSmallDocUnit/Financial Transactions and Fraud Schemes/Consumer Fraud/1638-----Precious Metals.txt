Precious Metals 
The precious metals market has traditionally been one of wide variances. Prices fluctuate 
constantly and even experts have trouble deciding what the next trend will be. Telemarketing 
operations play on this instability with offerings of gold, silver, and platinum. Once again, 
victims are told prices will never be this good again and that if they hesitate, they will miss a 
singular opportunity to make a fortune.
