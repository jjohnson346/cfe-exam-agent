Home-Based Businesses    
A popular fad today, many companies marketing home-based businesses require a person to 
buy materials for assembly-at-home products. The consumer is promised that the company 
will purchase the completed products, and when it does not, the consumer is left with a bad 
investment and a stock of cheap, worthless goods.
