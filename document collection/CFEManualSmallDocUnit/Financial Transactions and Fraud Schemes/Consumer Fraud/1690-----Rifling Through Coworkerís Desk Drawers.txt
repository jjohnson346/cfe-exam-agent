Rifling Through Coworker’s Desk Drawers 
When people leave for break, go to lunch, or take vacation or sick leave, many if not most, 
do not lock up their desks or offices. Many people also leave personal items in their desk 
drawers, such as bank statements, monthly credit card statements, or mortgage coupon 
books — all of which have useful information for an identity thief.
