OPTIONS 
Ads in the real estate section of newspapers coax investors into buying “options” on 
property. Supposedly, the option locks in a present-day price on behalf of the purchaser, 
who can exercise the option later if he wishes to buy the land or to sell it at a profit. 
Sometimes the investor has bought nothing but a piece of paper — the “agent” has no 
authority to make deals on the property. Occasionally, the option is only valid for a few 
months, or is too vaguely worded to be enforceable. Usually there is an actual plot of land, 
but in most instances it is undevelopable due to location or zoning restrictions, and is 
therefore worthless.
