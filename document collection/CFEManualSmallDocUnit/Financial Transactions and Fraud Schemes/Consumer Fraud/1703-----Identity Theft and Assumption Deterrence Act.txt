Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act 
In October 1998, Congress passed the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act 
(Identity Theft Act) to address the problem of identity theft. Specifically, the Act outlaws the 
intentional and unauthorized use of another individual’s identification, with the intent to 
commit a crime.  
 
It carries a maximum term of 15 years’ imprisonment, a fine, and criminal forfeiture of any 
personal property used or intended to be used to commit the offense. (The penalty is 
increased to a maximum of 30 years imprisonment if the offense is committed to facilitate 
an act of terrorism.) Identity theft schemes may also involve other violations such as mail 
fraud, wire fraud, credit card fraud, or financial institution fraud. 
 
Violations of the Act are investigated by federal investigative agencies such as the U.S. Secret 
Service, the FBI, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and are prosecuted by the 
Department of Justice.
