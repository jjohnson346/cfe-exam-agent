Bank Examiner Swindle     
Bank examiner swindles are also perpetrated on older women, especially widows with access 
to their husbands’ life insurance policies. The con man impersonates a bank examiner 
investigating her bank. He asks her to withdraw a certain amount of cash from her account, 
place it in an envelope, and allow him to inspect the bills for counterfeits. Many con men use 
false IDs and dress to take on this role.
