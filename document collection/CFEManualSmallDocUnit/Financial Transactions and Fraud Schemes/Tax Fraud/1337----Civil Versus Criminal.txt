Civil Versus Criminal 
Although the burden of proving fraud is on the IRS, the primary determinant of whether the 
IRS pursues a civil rather than a criminal fraud charge is what it believes it can prove. There 
also might be budgetary and staffing constraints that might dictate whether a suit is pursued 
civilly or criminally.  
 
The difference between civil and criminal in the view of the IRS is that a civil case never 
ripens into a crime, and criminal offenses involve behavior too insidious to be disposed of 
on a civil basis. Failure to cooperate might raise a civil case to a crime because it might 
demonstrate willful intent.
