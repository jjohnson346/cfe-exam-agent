Taxpayer Penalties 
Taxpayers with a tax deficiency may be subject to civil or criminal penalties. The primary 
determinant of whether the IRS pursues a civil rather than a criminal fraud charge is what it 
believes it can prove.  
 
From the IRS’s perspective, a civil case never ripens into a crime, but a criminal offense 
involves behavior too insidious to be disposed of on a civil basis.
