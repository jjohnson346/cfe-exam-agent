Definitions of False 
• When “false” appears by itself, and not coupled with a penalty or the creation of an 
offense, then false means incorrect [ Eliot National Bank v. Gill, 218 F. 600 (1st Cir 1914)]. 
• False means it is incorrect, but made in good faith [ National Bank of Commerce in St. Louis 
v. Allen, 223 F. 472 (8th Cir 1915)]. 
• Statements of opinion, as distinguished from those of material fact, are not fraud [ Ohio Brass 
Co. v. Commissioner, 17 BTA 1199 (1929)].
