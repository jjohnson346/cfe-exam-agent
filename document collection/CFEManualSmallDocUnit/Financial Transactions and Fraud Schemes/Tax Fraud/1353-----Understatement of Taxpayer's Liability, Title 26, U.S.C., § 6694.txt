Understatement of Taxpayer's Liability, Title 26, U.S.C., § 6694 
Section 6694 provides a penalty against a return preparer for understating a taxpayer’s 
liability due to an unreasonable position. Understatement means any understatement of the 
net amount payable or any overstatement of the net amount refundable. 
 
Section 6694 provides that unless there is a reasonable cause for an understatement and the 
preparer acted in good faith, a penalty of the greater of $1, 000 or 50 percent of the income 
derived (or to be derived) by the tax return preparer will be assessed against any preparer 
who knew or reasonably should have known that a position taken on a return was: 
• Not realistically possible of being sustained on its merits. 
• Not disclosed under U.S.C., § 6662(d)(2)(B)(ii). 
• A frivolous position.
