Circumstantial Evidence 
Certain circumstances constitute circumstantial evidence of tax fraud, including: 
• Illicit income, which can be proved by showing that the subject’s assets or expenditures 
for a given period exceed that which can be accounted for from admitted sources of 
income  
• Income in excess of deposits (e.g., audits of service industry people in Texas led to 
assessments of several thousand dollars in back taxas and penalties)
