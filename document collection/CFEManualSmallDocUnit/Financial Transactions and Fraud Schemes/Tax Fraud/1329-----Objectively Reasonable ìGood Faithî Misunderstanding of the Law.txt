Objectively Reasonable “Good Faith” Misunderstanding of the Law  
Good faith or a legitimate misunderstanding of the requirements of the law negates 
willfulness, [ U.S. v. Cheek, 931 F.2d 1206 (7th Cir 1991), aff’d. 111 U.S. 604 (1991)]. The case 
held, however, that the belief that taxes are in violation of the Constitution was not 
“objectively reasonable” so as to negate willfulness.

Willfulness can be inferred from conduct, such as: 
• Keeping a double set of books (not to be confused with GAAP and tax records). 
• Making false entries or alterations or creating false invoices or documents. 
• Destruction of books or records. 
• Concealment of assets (illicit income). 
• Covering up sources of income. 
• Avoiding making records usual in transactions of the kind. 
• Conduct that misleads or conceals [ Spies v. U.S., 317 U.S. 492 (1943).].
