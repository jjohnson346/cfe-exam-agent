Aiding or Assisting in the Preparation of a False Return 
Section 7206(2) makes it a crime to aid or assists in the preparation of a false return. Under 
this section, a person is guilty of a felony and may be subject to a fine of up to $100,000 (or 
$500,000 in the case of a corporation) and/or imprisonment of up to three years  
 
This felony is without regard to the knowledge or consent of the person(s) authorized or 
required to present the return, affidavit, claim, or other document. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Rudolf deSouza, president and owner of de fense contractor R.D. International, was 
indicted on 86 counts of conspiracy, conversion of government property, money laundering, 
filing false income tax returns, and submitting false claims and false statements. The 
indictment is the result of a three-and-half-year investigation by the Naval Investigative 
Service and the Criminal Investigative Division of the IRS.  
 
According to the indictment, deSouza conspired to inflate the expenses of RDI — and his 
own income — in an effort to impede the IRS. As  part of the conspiracy, he allegedly filed 
false corporate income tax returns for RDI that claimed deductions for salaries that were 
never paid. The indictment says that RDI used an accrual method of accounting, and 
deducted as a business expense salaries that accrued to deSouza. During a five-year period, 
the contractor claimed $490,000  in such deductions. The accrued salaries not paid were 
entered on RDI’s books as loans from an officer. 
 
In addition, the indictment alleges that RDI employees purchased computer equipment from 
a vendor, and then leased it at deSouza’s dire ction to BKS Trading at an inflated price. 
Consequently, RDI billed the government for the cost of the fictitious lease, and did not give 
the computers to the government even though it had been reimbursed for them. Moreover, 
the indictment accuses deSouza of  claiming thousands of dollars worth of personal expenses 
as business expenses. Specifically, he is alleged to have charged the government for trips to 
Disneyland, Disney World, and Canada.

The money laundering charges involve allegations that deSouza used several bank accounts 
to conduct approximately $900,000 in financial transactions designed to hide corporate 
assets from the bankruptcy court. Specifically, deSouza is accused of having caused 
numerous transfers of money from RDI acco unts to those of GM Technologies. These 
transfers had the effect of reducing the balance of funds in RDI accounts. Further, deSouza 
did not disclose to the bankruptcy court the existence of GM Technologies, his family’s 
controlling interest, or the money transfers fr om RDI. The indictment  also alleges that 
deSouza transferred money from RDI to another family-owned company while the 
bankruptcy petition was pending.
