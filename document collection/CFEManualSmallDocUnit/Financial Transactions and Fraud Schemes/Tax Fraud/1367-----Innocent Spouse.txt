Innocent Spouse 
Innocent spouse relief permits a spouse to avoid tax liability. Under this doctrine, a spouse 
may be excused from tax liability for tax or tax penalties if a joint tax return was filed and the  
spouse can establish the following elements:  
• The underpayment of tax is due to unreported income or disallowed deductions that are 
attributable to the other spouse
