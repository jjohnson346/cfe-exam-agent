Corporate Fraud  
Corporate fraud  depends on the intent of the corporate officers [Auerbach Shoe Co. v. 
Commissioner, 21 TC 191 (1st Cir. 1953)]. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Charging airline tickets to “air freight” (a false representat ion) coupled with the failure to 
credit refunds for redeemed tickets to the corp oration was sufficient to render the corporate 
returns fraudulent [ Kreps v.  Commissioner, 42 TC 660 (1964) aff’d, 351 F.2d 1 
(2nd Cir 1965)]. 
 
EXAMPLE 
A 40 percent shareholder/officer of a corporation embezzled corporate funds for her 
personal use, then falsified corporate records.  The corporation incorrectly claimed deductions 
based on the false records. The fraud claim was not sustained against the corporation 
[Botwinik Bros. of Mass., Inc. v. Commissioner, 39 TC 988 (1963)].
