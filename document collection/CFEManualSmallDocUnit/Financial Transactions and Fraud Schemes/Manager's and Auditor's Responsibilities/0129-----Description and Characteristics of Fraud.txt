Description and Characteristics of Fraud 
AU section 316 emphasizes that while auditors do not make legal determinations about the 
existence of fraud, they should be interested in all acts that result in material misstatements 
of the financial statements. Such misstatements can be the result of either fraud or error, 
depending on whether the misstatements are intentional or unintentional.  
 
Two types of misstatements are considered relevant for audit purposes: 
• Misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting 
• Misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets
