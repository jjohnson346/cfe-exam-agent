Forming an Opinion on the Effectiveness of ICOFR 
In forming an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s ICOFR, the auditor must 
evaluate evidence from all sources. This includes not only the auditor’s tests of controls, but 
also any misstatements detected during the financial statement audit, as well as any identified 
control deficiencies. The auditor should also review any reports issued during the year by the 
internal audit function that pertain to ICOFR and should evaluate any deficiencies  
identified therein.  
 
The auditor must also evaluate management’s assessment of ICOFR, included in its annual 
reports filed with the SEC, to ensure that all required elements in management’s report are 
complete and properly presented. 
 
At the close of the integrated audit, the auditor may choose to issue a single report 
containing both an opinion on the company’s financial statements and an opinion on 
ICOFR, or to issue a separate report for each opinion.
