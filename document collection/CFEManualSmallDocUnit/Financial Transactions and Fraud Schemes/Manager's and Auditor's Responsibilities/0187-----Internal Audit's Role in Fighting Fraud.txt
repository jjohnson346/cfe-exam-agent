Internal Audit's Role in Fighting Fraud 
Fighting fraud in an organization requires the combined efforts of many different 
departments, including internal audit. Internal auditors assist in the prevention and detection 
of fraud by evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls, assisting 
management in establishing effective fraud prevention measures, proactively auditing for 
fraud, and investigating suspected fraud. Specifically, the Practice Guide states that in 
conducting audit engagements, the internal auditor should: 
• Consider fraud risks in the assessment of internal control design and determination of 
audit steps to perform.  
• Have sufficient knowledge of fraud to identify red flags indicating fraud may have been 
committed. 
• Be alert to opportunities that could allow fraud, such as control deficiencies. 
• Evaluate whether management is actively retaining responsibility for oversight of the 
fraud risk management program, whether timely and sufficient corrective measures have 
been taken with respect to any noted control deficiencies or weaknesses, and whether 
the plan for monitoring the program continues to be adequate for the program’s ongoing 
success. 
• Evaluate the indicators of fraud and decide whether any further action is necessary or 
whether an investigation should be recommended. 
• Recommend investigation when appropriate.  
 
The role internal audit plays in fraud investigations varies by organization. Internal audit may 
have primary responsibility for fraud investigations, may serve as a resource for the 
investigations, or may have no involvement at all in the investigations. For internal auditors 
who find themselves involved in fraud investigations, the Practice Guide discusses the 
investigation process, the role of the internal auditor, conducting the investigation, reporting

the investigation, resolution and communication of fraud incidents, and analysis of lessons 
learned. 
 
The Practice Guide also emphasizes that internal auditors must exercise professional 
skepticism — an attitude that includes a questioning mind and a critical assessment of audit 
evidence — in all audit work. By exercising professional skepticism and focusing on the 
effectiveness of internal controls, auditors increase the likelihood that they will uncover 
possible fraudulent activity.
