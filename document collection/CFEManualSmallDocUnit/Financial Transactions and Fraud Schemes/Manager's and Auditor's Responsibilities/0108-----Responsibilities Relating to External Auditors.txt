Responsibilities Relating to External Auditors 
The audit committee has sole responsibility for hiring, paying, retaining, overseeing, and, if 
necessary, firing the company’s outside auditors, as well as the ultimate authority to approve 
all audit engagement fees and terms. As a result, the external auditors must report directly to 
the audit committee. The committee is also charged with resolving any disputes that arise 
between the external auditors and management regarding financial reporting issues. 
 
All audit and permitted non-audit services, other than de minimis services, provided by the 
external auditor must be pre-approved by the audit committee. The audit committee can 
accomplish this either by approving all services separately prior to each engagement or by 
establishing a detailed set of pre-approval policies and procedures covering all engagements, 
as long as the audit committee is informed on a timely basis of each service and the 
responsibility of pre-approval cannot be shifted to management. If the committee chooses 
to implement a set of pre-approval policies and procedures, then either a clear description or 
copy of those policies and procedures must be included with the company’s proxy 
statement.
