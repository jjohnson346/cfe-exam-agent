Internal Auditor Responsibilities 
Internal auditors play a key role in helping organizations prevent and detect fraudulent 
activity. Because of their proximity to and understanding of the inner workings of the 
organization, internal auditors are in a unique position to uncover potential unscrupulous 
acts. In fact, the ACFE’s 2010 Report to the Nations on  Occupational Fraud and Abuse  shows that 
the internal audit function plays a vital role in detecting occupational frauds, accounting for 
the detection of 13.9 percent of the 1,843 cases included in the study. 
 
As part of its International Professional Practices Framework  (IPPF), The Institute of Internal 
Auditors (IIA) has developed the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal 
Auditing. This section includes those IIA standards that pertain to the internal auditor’s 
responsibilities for preventing, detecting, and assessing the risk of fraud within an 
organization. More detail on these and all other IIA standards can be found at the IIA’s 
website (www.theiia.org).
