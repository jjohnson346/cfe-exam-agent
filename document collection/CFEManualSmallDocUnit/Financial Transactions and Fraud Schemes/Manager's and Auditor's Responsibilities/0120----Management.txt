Management 
Ultimately, management is responsible for the prevention and detection of fraud within an 
organization. It is management’s job to ensure the proper internal controls are in place to 
prevent fraud, as well as to detect it. Although management may not execute all of the 
controls—as the performance of internal cont rol functions are generally spread across 
individuals throughout the entire organization, including individual contributors, 
management, and even the Board of Directors—management is also responsible for 
monitoring and remediating internal controls to ensure they are effectively designed and 
operating to prevent and detect fraud. 
 
As mentioned above, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 includes several requirements of 
management in public companies. Also discussed above, COSO provided several guidelines 
for management’s prevention and detection of fraud through the internal control 
environment. 
 
Although preparing the financial statements is the responsibility of management, fraud is 
also frequently investigated by members of management or by people under the direction 
and control of management. This can present potential conflicts.
