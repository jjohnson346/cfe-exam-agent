Importance of Exercising Professional Skepticism 
AU section 230, Due Professional Care in the Performance of Work, states that due professional 
care requires the auditor to exercise professional skepticism. Because of the characteristics of 
fraud, the auditor should conduct the audit “w ith a mindset that recognizes the possibility 
that a material misstatement due to fraud could be present.” AU section 230 also requires an 
“ongoing questioning” of whether information the auditor obtains could suggest a material 
misstatement due to fraud.
