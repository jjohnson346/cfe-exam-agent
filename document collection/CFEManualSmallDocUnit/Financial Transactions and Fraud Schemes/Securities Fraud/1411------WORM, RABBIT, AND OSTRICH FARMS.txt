WORM, RABBIT, AND OSTRICH FARMS 
Although sometimes amusing when viewed objectively by the investigator, many investors 
have been defrauded by being persuaded to invest in exactly these types of opportunities. 
Fraud examiners can practice applying the Howey Test to these types of cases in an attempt 
to determine whether an investment contract exists. What, if anything, does the investor 
need to do in order to get the promised return? If, for example, the investor’s involvement is 
purely passive, then an investment contract will be held to exist. However, where the 
investor is involved in feeding the ostriches and marketing the meat, then the last element of 
the Howey Test fails.
