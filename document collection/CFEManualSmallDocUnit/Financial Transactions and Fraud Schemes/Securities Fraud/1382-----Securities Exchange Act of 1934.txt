Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
Unlike the 1933 Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 mainly deals with post-issuance 
trading. This Act, which gave birth to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), 
requires the registration of securities brokers and dealers. Simply put the 1933 Act can be 
thought of as regulating the issuance of the securities themselves, while the 1934 Act covers 
subsequent trading. This secondary market trading represents by far the greatest volume of 
securities transactions. Trading generally takes place on markets with actual trading floors, 
called “exchanges,” or on so-called “over-the-counter” markets such as NASDAQ. 
 
The 1934 Act contains section 10(b), a comprehensive anti-fraud provision, which permits 
the SEC to set forth rules and regulations that prohibit manipulative or deceptive devices or 
contrivances via the mails or other means of interstate commerce. For example, under 
section 10(b), the SEC promulgated Rule 10b-5, which prohibits false statements and other 
fraudulent activity in connection with securities transactions. Specifically, Rule 10b-5 states 
that:  
 
“It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or 
instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of any national 
securities exchange, 
 
(1)  to employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud, 
 
(2)  to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact 
necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under 
which they were made, not misleading, or

(3)  to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as 
a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any 
security.”
