Securities Fraud

Introduction 
In order to effectively conduct investigations or examinations of fraudulent securities 
transactions, fraud examiners and investigators need a general understanding of both federal 
and state laws and the philosophy behind regulation. Many financial products and 
opportunities can be deemed to be securities, but that is often far from obvious to an 
untrained observer. This section helps provide fraud examiners with the tools necessary to 
recognize securities fraud and conduct a successful investigation.  
 
The primary purpose of securities regulation is to balance the legitimate needs of business to 
raise capital against the need to protect investors. The worth of a security comes from the 
value of the interest it represents—it has no inherent value. Securities are not a commodity 
to be consumed, but more resemble a currency being traded. 
 
Although there is some commonality between federal and state laws regarding the regulation 
of the securities industry, there exists a complex web of laws from 50 states in addition to 
federal regulation. Each state has its own securities laws and even where the law is similar, 
interpretation and rules may differ markedly. Regulation of securities transactions covers not 
only their sale, but also the offer of securities to the public.
