Trading Basics 
A trader who buys futures contracts (assuming this is not an offsetting transaction) is long 
the market and will profit if prices rise (for example, if you bought a December corn 
contract at $2.70 per bushel and the price rose to $2.80 per bushel, you would have an 
unrealized profit of $500 (.10  cents x 5,000 bushels)). Because open commodity positions 
(transactions that are not offset) are marked to market at the end of the trading day, this 
$500 profit will be credited to your trading a ccount and is available as margin for additional 
contract purchases. This transfer of funds occurs through the clearing corporation of  
the exchange.  
 
The transaction counterpart of the long buyer is the short seller. Using the above example, if 
you sold a December corn contract at $2.70 per bushel and the price rose to $2.80 per 
bushel, you would have an unrealized loss of $500 (.10 cents x 5,000 bushels). Again, open 
commodity positions are marked to market at the end of the trading day, meaning that this 
$500 loss will be debited from your trading account.
