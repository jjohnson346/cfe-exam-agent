Relationship of the Underlying Security to an Option 
The value of options is primarily derived from the value of the underlying security. For 
example, XYZ common stock closed today at $88.29 per share and the strike prices of the 
Securities Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1530                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
October 2008 XYZ calls ranged from $65 per share to $135 per share. The more that the 
share price of XYZ is above a particular strike price the greater the value of that option. The 
stock price of $88 per share is about $23 over  the strike price of the XYZ $65 calls. The 
current premium for XYZ $65 calls is $22.90 per share. A trader who had previously bought 
this call option could sell it back into the market for about $2,290 ($22.90 x 100 shares) or 
could exercise the option and buy the stock at $65 with the market at $88.  
 
Options can be in the money, out of the money, or at the money. A call option is in the 
money when the price of the underlying security exceeds its strike price. Likewise, a put 
option is in the money when the price of the underlying security is less than its strike price. 
Options are at the money when the price of the underlying security is about the same as the 
strike price. All other options are out of the money.
