Insider Trading 
Under the legal theory of misappropriation, the use of non-public information to profit from 
purchase or sale of securities may violate the insiders’ fiduciary duty to their company or 
shareholders. Although not all courts accept this argument, criminal charges are not unusual 
in cases of this nature. Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken, indicted for insider trading in the 
late 1980s, both served time in prison.  
  
EXAMPLE 
A California psychotherapist, pleaded guilty to securities fraud after federal officials accused 
him of making a nice profit after trading on some inside information he learned during a 
counseling session with a client. 
 
According to federal officials, the psychotherapist bought common stock in Lockheed Corp. 
hours after his client — a company executive undergoing marriage counseling — mentioned 
the secret and ultimately successful merger talks between Lockheed and Martin Marietta 
Corp. 
 
Under a legal doctrine known as the “misappropriation theory,” he was deemed to have 
violated securities laws because he stole information from a person who had assumed his 
trust and discretion, and then used the in formation to trade on the stock market.
