Self-Regulatory Organizations 
SEC delegates significant regulatory authority to “self-regulatory organizations” (SROs). 
SROs oversee the markets they operate and police the member firms participating in those 
markets. SROs create and enforce rules dealing with such areas as securities listings, 
exchange and settlement procedures, and member qualifications. 
 
The Maloney Act of 1938 amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to allow the 
National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) to regulate the business of members 
subject to Securities and Exchange Commission oversight.  
 
In 2007, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) was created through the 
consolidation of NASD and the member regulation, enforcement, and arbitration functions 
of the New York Stock Exchange. FINRA is dedicated to investor protection and market 
integrity through effective and efficient regulation and complementary compliance and 
technology-based services.  
 
FINRA touches virtually every aspect of the securities business—from registering and 
educating industry participants to examining securities firms; writing rules; enforcing those 
rules and the federal securities laws; informing and educating the investing public; providing 
trade reporting and other industry utilities; and administering the largest dispute resolution 
forum for investors and registered firms. It also performs market regulation under contract 
for the NASDAQ Stock Market, the American Stock Exchange, the International Securities 
Exchange, and the Chicago Climate Exchange. All told, FINRA oversees more than 5,000 
brokerage firms, about 172,000 branch offices, and more than 676,000 registered securities 
representatives.

Securities broker-dealers must register with the SEC and in those states where they plan to 
do business. If they plan to do business with the public they must also become FINRA 
members. Typical registration requirements include business, financial, disciplinary 
information, and disclosure of criminal convictions.
