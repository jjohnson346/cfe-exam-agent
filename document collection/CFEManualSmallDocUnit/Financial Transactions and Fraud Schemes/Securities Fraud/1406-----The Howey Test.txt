The Howey Test 
In the case SEC v. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 299 (1946), a company was selling subdivided 
sections of a Florida orange orchard that were to be managed by a subsidiary company. In its 
opinion in the case, the U.S. Supreme Court outlined a four-element test to determine if an 
investment contract was present. In essence, the Supreme Court stated that there must be: 
• An investment  of money or other asset.  
• A common enterprise.  In very general terms, the common enterprise requirement means the 
success of the investor is dependent on the efforts and success of those seeking the 
investment of third parties (typically the promoter). The third party, who provides the 
entrepreneurial skill, shares in the profits (or losses) with the investor. Usually, the 
common enterprise requirement will be met where “the fortunes of the investor are 
interwoven with and dependent upon the efforts and success of those seeking the 
investment or a third-party.” See SEC v. Glenn W. Turn er Enterprises, Inc.,  474 F.2nd 476, 
482 n.7 (9th Circuit, 1973). 
• An expectation of profits. Profit is generally defined to be either money received for the use 
of capital or capital appreciation. In United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837 
(1975), stock sold to potential apartment renters, which would be applied to their 
security deposit, was not held to be an investment contract because the individuals were 
attracted solely by the prospect of somewhere to live, not financial return on their 
money. 
• Profit must be generated solely from the efforts of others.  The essential managerial efforts, which 
affect the success or failure of the enterprise, come from the third party (the promoter) 
not the investor. In Howey, the subsidiary company was to plant, cultivate, and harvest 
the oranges. As a general rule, the more actively involved an investor is in the enterprise, 
the less likely it is that an investment contract will be held to exist. Subsequent case law 
has diluted “solely” to “primarily” or “substantially” from the efforts of others. 
Nevertheless, if the investor’s efforts  are significant in the success of the enterprise, an 
investment contract will not be found to exist. For example, in the Forman case 
mentioned above, the court stated “an in vestment contract is the presence of an

investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be 
derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.”
