Investment Contracts 
Other transactions are less obviously securities, but fall under the catch-all category of an 
“investment contract.” Unfortunately, the term “investment contract” is not usually defined 
by statute, and it is, therefore, necessary to look to case law to determine whether a particular 
transaction may constitute an investment contract. Many fraudulent schemes involving 
exotic investments can be argued to constitute the offer or sale of investment contracts.
