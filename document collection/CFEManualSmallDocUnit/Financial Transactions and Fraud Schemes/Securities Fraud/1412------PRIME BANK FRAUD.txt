PRIME BANK FRAUD 
These schemes involve the issuance and purported trading of so-called “prime bank” notes 
or other high-yield investment opportunities. Investors are often told that they can obtain 
returns exceeding several hundred percent per year when their funds are placed in an off-
 shore trading program. Excessive complexity and secrecy generally characterize these 
fraudulent programs. Investors are usually told that this opportunity is only available to a 
select few and the signing of non-disclosure agreements is mandatory. Typically the 
explanation of how the program actually works is full of obscure terminology and makes 
reference to legitimate banks or organizations such as the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) to lend credibility. Often, investors are told that there is little or no risk of losing their 
principal. Despite warnings published by the state regulators, the SEC, the IMF, the 
International Chamber of Commerce, and the World Bank, this type of fraud continues to 
fleece millions of dollars from investors worldwide.
