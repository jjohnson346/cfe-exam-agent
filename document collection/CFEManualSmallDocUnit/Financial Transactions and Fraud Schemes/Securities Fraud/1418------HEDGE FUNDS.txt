HEDGE FUNDS 
Although there is no statutory or regulatory definition of “hedge fund,” the term typically 
refers to private pooled investment vehicles managed by advisers who generally have a very 
large financial interest in the funds based on a management fee that includes a percentage of 
the fund’s performance. Hedge funds employ various speculative and aggressive strategies 
that are not commonly available to mutual funds. They often combine traditional 
investments with short sales, leveraging, and arbitrage strategies to maximize returns.  
 
In the past few years, the U.S. securities market has seen a significant growth in the number 
and size of hedge funds. According to the SEC, assets under management by hedge funds 
have grown dramatically and are now estimated to exceed $2 trillion. This is a massive jump 
from the $38 billion hedge fund industry in 1990. Consequently, hedge fund fraud has grown 
substantially enough for the SEC to take extraordinary measures to regulate it. Between 2000 
and 2004, the SEC brought 51 cases against hedge fund advisers for defrauding hedge fund 
investors or using the funds to defraud others. In 2005, the SEC brought 11 hedge fund 
fraud cases and had several investigations underway. In 2007, the SEC created a hedge fund 
working group within the Division of Enforcement. Working with other federal law 
enforcement agencies and self-regulatory organizations, the group leads agency efforts to 
combat hedge fund insider trading. In the most significant insider trading case in 20 years, 
the SEC filed charges in 2007 against 14 defendants in a scheme involving hedge funds that 
netted more than $15 million in illegal profits on thousands of trades, using information 
stolen from UBS Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley.    
 
With the enormous growth in the hedge fund industry, advisers are becoming more 
aggressive and less meticulous in their transactions. Typical hedge fund fraud by investors 
includes: 
• Theft of investor assets;  
• Late trading;  
• Insider trading;  
• Overvaluation of portfolios;  
• Entering into inappropriate timing arrangements;  
• Exploitation of mutual fund investors for private gain;  
• Entering into inappropriate arrangements with mutual fund advisers in which the mutual

fund advisers waive restrictions on market timing in exchange for placement of other 
assets by the hedge fund adviser in funds managed by a mutual fund adviser; and  
• Conspiring with intermediaries to identify hedge funds from mutual fund personnel.
