Subject 
In general, the subject (also called the suspect or accused) is interviewed last, after all facts 
necessary to resolve the allegation are obtained. Even if it is felt that the subject will not 
offer a confession, an interview is usually scheduled; in many instances it can be used later 
for impeachment. An interview might also give the examiner a good idea of what defenses 
the subject might raise.
