Proof Stages in Fraud Cases 
Proof in most complex white-collar cases usually proceeds through three basic stages. First, 
the fraud examiner builds the circumstantial case through interviews of cooperative 
witnesses and review of available documentation. Then the examiner uses the circumstantial 
evidence to identify and persuade an inside witness who can provide direct evidence against 
the defendant. Then the case is sealed, defenses are identified and rebutted, and intent is 
proved through examination of the subject.
