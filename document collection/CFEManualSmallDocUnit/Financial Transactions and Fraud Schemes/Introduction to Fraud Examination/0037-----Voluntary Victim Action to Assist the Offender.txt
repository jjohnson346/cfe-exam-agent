Voluntary Victim Action to Assist the Offender 
Proof that the victim assisted the offender usually is not difficult to obtain from the victim. 
It is important for the fraud examiner to ascertain the exact circumstances regarding the 
fraud from the victim, clearly drawing out what made the fraud possible. In the case of 
employee thefts, for example, the victim (the company) entrusted the care of assets to the 
subject. That fiduciary capacity must be established.
