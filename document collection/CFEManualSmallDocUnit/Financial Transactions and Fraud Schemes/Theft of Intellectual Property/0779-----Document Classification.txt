Document Classification 
Document classification is also an important area in a protection plan. Working closely with 
each department, proprietary documents should be classified according to the level of 
security that best meets the company’s need s. For instance, documents may be labeled 
“private” for personnel matters and move up to “restricted” for pricing or marketing 
information. Trade secrets or highly sensitive information might be labeled “authorized 
access only.” Notes and drafts of documents should also be safeguarded or destroyed when 
the final document is completed.
