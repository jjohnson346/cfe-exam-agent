Employment Advertisements 
Employment want-ads are a great way for intelligence thieves to get existing employees from 
a target company to turn over sensitive information. The bogus ads offer great job

of placing the advertisement. In a highly competitive job market, fake interviews serve as a 
powerful tool in corporate espionage.
