Recruited Spies 
In order to obtain inside information on a targeted company, a spy will frequently try to 
recruit an existing employee of that company to act as his agent on the inside. An employee 
recruited to spy against his employer is known as a mole. The mole agrees to betray the trust 
of his employer by handing over confidential information that belongs to his organization. 
The three most common recruiting methods are false flag recruitment, recruiting by 
justification, and trapping.
