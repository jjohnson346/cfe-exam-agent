Legal Issues Related to Theft of Intellectual Property  
The Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (Title 18, U.S. Code, §§1831-1839)  makes the theft of 
trade secrets a federal criminal offense. Under this statute, the Department of Justice has 
sweeping authority to prosecute trade secret theft whether it is in the United States, via the 
Internet, or outside the United States. This statute is discussed in more detail in the chapter 
on “Law Related to Fraud” in the Law section of the Fraud Examiners Manual. 
 
 
 
 
Financial Transactions  Financial Institution Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.901 
External fraud schemes are those committed by outside organizations, typically by individuals or 
groups of individuals against organizations. Fraud schemes committed by outsiders usually 
occur in industry. Therefore, the rest of this section is organized by type of industry, starting 
with financial institution frauds. Because some schemes are committed by collusion between 
an organizational insider and an outsider, some frauds can be classified as both internal and 
external schemes.
