Electronic Sources 
Electronic sources of data are some of the most powerful research tools in the intelligence 
analyst’s arsenal. These resources, which include CD-ROMs and online databases, contain 
compilations of data on bankruptcies, new business filings, telephone directories, UCC 
filings, criminal records, corporate data, and many other types of information. If one 
includes the many local, regional, and national newspapers available electronically, the 
research capabilities of one intelligence analyst sitting at his computer are truly staggering. 
 
Large public or university libraries frequently provide free network access to newspaper, 
magazine, and other journalistic sources. More information about electronic sources is 
contained in the “Accessing Information Online”  chapter in the Investigation section of the 
Fraud Examiners Manual.
