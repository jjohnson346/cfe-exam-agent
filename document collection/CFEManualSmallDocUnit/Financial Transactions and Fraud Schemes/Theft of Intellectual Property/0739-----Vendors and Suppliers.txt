Vendors and Suppliers 
Secondary interviewing of suppliers and vendors by corporate spies poses a problem. A 
company rarely has direct control over what its suppliers and vendors tell third parties. So 
suppliers and vendors should be given information on a need-to-know basis only. 
 
Proper training of purchasing agents is also helpful. Suppliers of highly critical components 
or services need to be signatories to nondisclosure agreements. If intelligence reveals a 
supplier to be a major leak, the short-term answer may be sending misinformation through 
that supplier. The long-term solution would be termination, legal action, or both.
