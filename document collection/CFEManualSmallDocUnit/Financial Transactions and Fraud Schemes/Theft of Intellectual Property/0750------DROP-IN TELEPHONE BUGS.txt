DROP-IN TELEPHONE BUGS 
Spies frequently use drop-in telephone bugs, which have the advantage of blending in with 
everyday existing telephone equipment. Drop-in bugs are simply inserted into the handset 
device on a normal telephone. The target’s conv ersations are transmitted to a remote 
receiver where they are recorded.  
 
Drop-in bugs are rarely detected because most people never bother to unscrew the plastic 
covers on the handset and perform a detailed check of the internal components. Thus, a 
drop-in telephone bug offers minimal risk of exposure to the spy. When a spy has access to 
the physical premises of a target and wants to be able to listen to conversations on a 
particular telephone line, this device is usually the chosen method of surveillance.
