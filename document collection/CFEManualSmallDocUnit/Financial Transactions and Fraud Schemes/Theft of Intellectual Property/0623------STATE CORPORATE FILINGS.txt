STATE CORPORATE FILINGS 
States require that companies that do business within their jurisdictions register each year 
with the state government, usually through the Secretary of State’s office. This requirement 
extends to all companies operating in the state, not just those that are publicly traded.  
 
Many Secretary of State websites have enhanced search capabilities for business 
organizations, including searching by entity name, and by name of the person listed as a 
registered agent, officer, or director of a corporation. This search capability allows an 
intelligence analyst to find all the companies within a state in which a person serves as an 
officer or as a director. A search can help the CI professional develop a family tree of the 
officer’s business interests. It becomes a useful tool for uncovering lesser-known or hidden 
connections between businesses. The financial strength of a targeted business often lies in its 
affiliates or subsidiaries, which rise to the surface in an officer/director search.
