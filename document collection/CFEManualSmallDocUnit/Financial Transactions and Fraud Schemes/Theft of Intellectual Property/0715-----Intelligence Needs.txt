Intelligence Needs 
Good intelligence gathering is a prelude to any successful counteroffensive against industrial 
espionage agents. If a manager does not know the opponents and their methods of attack, 
effective cloaking and misdirection will not be possible. 
 
An effective intelligence-gathering network need not employ an army of spies. Basic 
intelligence can be gathered from a variety of sources, which include print media, 
commercial databases, networking with other security managers, existing staff within the 
company, and regular security surveys of the business. This type of ongoing, low-level 
intelligence program helps identify potential and emerging security problems. Increasing the 
activity during periods of heightened threat to the business is not difficult. Because a 
preliminary intelligence system will already be in place, bringing on additional personnel and 
resources will not be overwhelming.
