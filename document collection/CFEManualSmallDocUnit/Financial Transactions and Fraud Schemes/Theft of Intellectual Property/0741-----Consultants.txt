Consultants 
Consultants can be a source of leaks, and their access to confidential or sensitive information 
should therefore be kept on a need-to-know status. Their activities should be 
compartmentalized as much as possible. As with vendors and suppliers, consultants can be 
fed misinformation if they are suspected of leaking data to a competitor.  
 
If highly sensitive information must be discussed with a consultant, it may be advisable to 
place the discussions in a context that limits the consultant’s knowledge of inside 
information. For example, an expert can tell you what the melting point of a semiconductor 
material is, but they do not necessarily need to know why you need to know that 
information. Obviously, the need to pro tect information must be weighed against the
