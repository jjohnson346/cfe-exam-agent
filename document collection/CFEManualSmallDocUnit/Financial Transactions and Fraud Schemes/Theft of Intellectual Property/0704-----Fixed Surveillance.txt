Fixed Surveillance 
Fixed surveillance, while it has many advantages over moving surveillance, has one great 
vulnerability. The base from which the surveillance is conducted (for example, a van parked 
across the street from the subject) might be spotted by the target, as well as neighbors and 
curious passersby. In order to camouflage a fixed surveillance campaign, the spy must be 
familiar with the surroundings and choose a cover that will blend in.
