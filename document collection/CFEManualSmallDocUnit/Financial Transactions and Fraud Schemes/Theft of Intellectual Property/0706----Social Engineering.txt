Social Engineering 
In a social engineering scheme, the information thief manipulates people into handing over 
secret information through use of trickery, persuasion, threats, or cajolery. The social 
engineer usually, though not always, operates by phone or e-mail. In some cases, the social 
engineer obtains direct information from her victim about a company’s business operations, 
contracts, customer lists, or so on. In other cases, a hacker uses social engineering to obtain 
passwords or otherwise gain access to a computer system. Social engineering is thought to 
play at least some part in most computer system penetrations.
