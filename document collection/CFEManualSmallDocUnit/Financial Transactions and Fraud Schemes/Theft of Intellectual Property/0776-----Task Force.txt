Task Force 
To coordinate a companywide SPI program, a task force should be assembled. The task 
force should include managers and staff from departments that deal with proprietary 
information such as research and development, and production. The team should also 
include representatives from corporate security, human resources, records management, data 
processing, and legal. 
 
The process should begin by determining what information should be protected. The task 
force should identify those areas that give the company its competitive edge, such as quality 
of the product, service, price, manufacturing technology, marketing, and distribution. One

way of accomplishing this is to ask the team, “If you were our competitor, what information 
would you like to know?”  
 
Once these sensitive areas have been identified, the primary focus should be on the 
information security procedures for each department. They should identify where 
proprietary information is kept and survey the risk if such information is lost to  
a competitor.
