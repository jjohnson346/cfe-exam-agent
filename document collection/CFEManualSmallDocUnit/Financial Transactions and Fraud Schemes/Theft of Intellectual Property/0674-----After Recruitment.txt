After Recruitment 
Once on board, the mole receives training on gathering intelligence safely and productively. 
This is not merely an afterthought; the success of the mission depends upon it. Recruits are 
taught what information they should target, how to collect data safely, how to follow security 
procedures, how to plant “bugs,” and other techniques that will help them effectively extract 
information from the target.
