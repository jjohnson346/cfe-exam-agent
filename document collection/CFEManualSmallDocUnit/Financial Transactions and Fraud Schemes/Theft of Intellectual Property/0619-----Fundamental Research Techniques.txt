Fundamental Research Techniques 
The initial level of the Intelligence Pyramid is composed of Fundamental Research 
Techniques, which include researching articles in magazines, journals, or newspapers, and 
consulting industry guidebooks. These fundamental sources of information allow the spy to 
build a partial picture of the target, and, equally important, to develop checklists of the 
information needed to fill in the blank spaces. These checklists are very important, because 
no intelligence effort should proceed without precise goals. For a spy to be effective, he 
must know exactly what is sought. Vague expeditions for information will produce vague 
results, so a shopping list becomes an absolute must. A competitive intelligence (CI) 
professional may spend many hours meeting with a client discussing in exacting detail the 
specifics of the mission. If the client is not clear on the objective, clarifying that issue 
becomes the first order of business.
