Networking 
Networking with other security professionals should not be difficult. Local chapters of ASIS, 
fellow CFEs, investigative organizations, and former law enforcement officers’ societies 
deserve full participation. Meetings of technical societies that are relevant to the business 
may also be worthwhile. Even though these meetings may not directly address security 
issues, they provide useful intelligence about the business. For example, if a company 
manufactures chemicals, the security manager could attend the state chemical society 
meeting to learn what is being publicly discussed about her company and the industry in 
general.
