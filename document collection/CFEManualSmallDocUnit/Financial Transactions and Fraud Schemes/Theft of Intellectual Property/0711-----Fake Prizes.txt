Fake Prizes 
Finally, fake gift certificates or sweepstakes can be used to get access to a person’s password. 
For instance, an employee of a target company is sent an e-mail gift certificate from a fake 
vendor the spy has set up. The employee might be told the gift certificate is a prize, or that it 
was purchased for them by a “secret admirer.” In any event, the employee only has to access 
the vendor’s website in order to select the me rchandise he wants to buy with his gift 
certificate. Of course, in order to make the purc hase he has to log onto a special area of the 
website, which requires a user ID and password. The spy in this scheme is betting that the 
employee will use the same user ID and password that he uses at work.
