Communications Between the Employee and the Control  
One of the major rules for an employee-spy is that she should not make direct contact with 
her control. Instead, the spy and control will typically communicate via a system of signals: a 
chalk mark in a public place, an innocuous e-mail to a secure address, an innocent note left 
on a bulletin board, graffiti on a wall, or a mundane newspaper ad. When e-mail is used to 
transfer documents, it is usually sent to untraceable addresses or employs intermediaries 
known as “cutouts.” 
 
When spies must make direct deliveries to their controls, they leave documents, computer 
media, or film and tapes at secure spy drops. These drop sites can be in parks, abandoned 
buildings, behind vending machines, or in other similar locations. The only requirements are 
accessibility, cover, security, and the imagination of the spy and his contact. Prearranged 
signals such as those described above are used to let the control know that an item has been 
left at the site. The control may leave the spy’s compensation at the same site.
