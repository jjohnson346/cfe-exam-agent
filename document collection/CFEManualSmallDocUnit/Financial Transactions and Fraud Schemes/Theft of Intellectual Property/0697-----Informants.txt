Informants 
The serious corporate spy will develop a network of paid informants who can get this 
monitoring intelligence for him. These informants come from a wide range of businesses: 
• Travel agents. 
• Airline reservation personnel. 
• Major credit card companies. 
• Staff at major Internet providers.  
• Employees at video, music, and other entertainment outlets.  
• Staff of adult entertainment providers that the target frequents. 
• Telephone company employees with access to telephone records. 
• Employees of commercial database providers such as Dialog and D&B who have access 
to transaction records. 
 
While the purpose of these informants is not to act as regular spies, they will, for a fee, 
provide transactional intelligence on a subject. That transactional information can have a 
critical impact. It can tell a corporate spy about: 
• A person’s vices. 
• Details of business travel. 
• Hotels where the target stayed and where she is likely to stay again in the future (this can 
be useful for setting up surveillance).  
• Whom the target has called. 
• Interests and hobbies (another way to edge into the target’s confidence). 
• Companies or subjects the target has researched. 
 
This type of intelligence is really a hybrid of documentary source intelligence (combining 
purely open sources and gray sources) and HUMINT. An inside contact is needed to obtain 
the information, but once the contact sells it to a corporate spy, the spy can analyze it 
without need of additional assistance. 
 
Monitoring intelligence is very helpful in the collection of human intelligence. If a spy knows 
a subject’s hobbies, she can see to it that she “m eets” the target at a restaurant, convention, 
etc., striking up a conversation or possibly a friendship. A targeted employee in this scenario 
becomes an unwitting source of information.  
 
The spy does not necessarily have to direct these efforts at an employee of the targeted 
organization. For instance, if the organization uses a contractor to microfilm its records, the 
Financial Transactions  Theft of Intellectual Property 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.843 
spy might attempt to compromise an employee of the contractor or penetrate its security 
rather than attacking the target organization directly.  
 
A spy can also become his own inside source of transactional intelligence. For example, if a 
spy wants to develop a telephone history on a subject, he can send the subject a free phone 
card for 60 minutes of calling time. There are companies that will mail the phone cards to 
the subject and then track all their calls for a small fee (less than $50.00). This kind of service 
can be a powerful intelligence-gathering device. Employees should be trained to be wary of 
this kind of scam.
