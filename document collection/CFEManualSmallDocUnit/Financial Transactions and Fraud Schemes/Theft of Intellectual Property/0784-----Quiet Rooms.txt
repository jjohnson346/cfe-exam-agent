Quiet Rooms 
A “quiet room” may cost anywhere from $15,000 to $200,000, but the cost may be justified 
depending on the risk involved. A quiet room is acoustically shielded and radio-frequency 
shielded. The room can also be equipped with intrusion monitoring sensors and closed-circuit 
television cameras.
