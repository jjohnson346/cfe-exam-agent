Computer System Penetrations
In some cases, information thieves will attempt to extract information by penetrating a 
company’s computer defenses. This can be part of an organized intelligence campaign, or in 
some cases it is simply a random attack by a hacker bent on mischief. For more information 
on how outsiders attempt to penetrate computer systems, see the “Computer and Internet 
Fraud” chapter in the Financial Transactions section of the Fraud Examiners Manual.
