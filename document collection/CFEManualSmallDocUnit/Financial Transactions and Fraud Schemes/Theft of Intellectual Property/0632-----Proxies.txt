Developing proxies—people who work with the target on a day-to-day basis—helps CI 
professionals color in many necessary details. Suppliers in particular can be a rich source of 
inside information about a targeted business. Suppliers spend significant time and resources 
to learn about their customers. They know what a customer orders, when they place orders, 
how much they spend, how long they take to pay their bills, and what the business cycle of 
the customer’s industry is. Interviews with these persons can be an invaluable source of
