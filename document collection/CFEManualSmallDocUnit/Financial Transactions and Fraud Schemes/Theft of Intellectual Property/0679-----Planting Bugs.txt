Planting Bugs 
Recruits are taught where listening devices should be planted in order to gather needed 
information and, at the same time, avoid detection. Bugs are usually placed in meeting 
rooms, offices of key employees, or other areas conducive to the discussion of secret 
information. Equally important is the decision of where to deploy taping equipment. The spy 
needs to place the equipment in a remote location where tapes can be safely retrieved. If 
taping is done on-site, the spy risks losing the tapes if the listening device is discovered. 
Finally, the spy must know when and how to service hidden listening devices, and how to 
safely remove them when the surveillance is finished.
