Third Tier Databases 
Competitive intelligence campaigns frequently operate under a short time frame; finding out 
if a competitor is about to expand production, for instance, may only be valuable if the spy 
learns in time for his employer to beat that rival to the punch. Because time is frequently a 
critical factor in an intelligence campaign, analysts tend to use the third tier of databases as a 
central tool. Those employing the most sophisticated search technologies include Dialog, 
ChoicePoint, D&B, and LexisNexis. These databases are generally able to provide more 
useful information in less time than lower tier alternatives.
