Classified Ads 
Employment advertisements, in particular, can provide valuable information about the job 
skills that a target company needs and the number of employees it is seeking to hire. This 
can help a spy infer what kinds of new projects are being developed within a company or 
where personnel resources are being devoted. Large-scale hiring could indicate that a 
competitor has signed or expects to sign a large contract. In some cases, employment ads 
also point out defections of key personnel.  
 
Employment ads also give a spy an indication of what the target company pays its 
employees. This could be valuable for the spy’s employer in recruiting battles for coveted 
personnel. It could also help the spy identify employees who may be susceptible to 
recruitment tactics because of low pay or a high rate of employee dissatisfaction (as 
evidenced by a high rate of turnover in a particular department).
