Nondisclosure Agreements 
All employees should sign a nondisclosure agreement. Everyone involved with the company 
should sign such an agreement, including subcontractors and their employees, clerical staff, 
consultants, and temporaries. Besides the legal value, a comprehensive nondisclosure 
agreement sends a signal to employees that the company has a tough attitude toward 
preventing leaks. It might also be necessary to have suppliers and distributors sign 
nondisclosure agreements. Although suppliers and distributors have to receive information 
about certain aspects of a business, employees dealing with them should be made aware of the 
potential for misuse of the information and should be instructed to provide them with only 
the information that is essential for them to do their jobs.
