MINUTES OF MEETINGS 
Records of high-level meetings can provide key insight on corporate strategies, investment 
policies, product development plans, marketing plans, and other crucial information about a 
business’s direction. They can also help the spy identify key employees; possibly even those 
who are unhappy with the current direction of their own company or careers and who, 
therefore, might be potential recruits as spies.
