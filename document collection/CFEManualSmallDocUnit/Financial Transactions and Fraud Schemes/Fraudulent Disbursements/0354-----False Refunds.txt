False Refunds 
A refund is processed at the register when a customer returns an item of merchandise that 
was purchased from the store. The transaction that is entered on the register indicates the 
merchandise is being replaced in the store’s inventory and the purchase price is being 
returned to the customer. In other words, a refund shows cash being disbursed from the 
register to the customer. (See “False Refunds” flowchart.)
