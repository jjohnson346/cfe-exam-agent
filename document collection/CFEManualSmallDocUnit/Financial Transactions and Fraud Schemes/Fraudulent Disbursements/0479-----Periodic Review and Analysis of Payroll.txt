Periodic Review and Analysis of Payroll 
Periodically, an independent review of the payroll might reveal that internal controls are not 
working as designed. Comparing deposit dates with dates of payroll disbursement or transfer 
may reveal ghost employees. An occasional independent payroll distribution may reveal 
ghost employees. 
 
The existence of the following may indicate the presence of ghost employees: 
• More than one employee with the same address. 
• More than one employee with the same government identification number. 
• More than one employee with the same account number (automatic deposit). 
• Employees with no withholding.
