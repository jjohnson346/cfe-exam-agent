THE FRAUDSTER AS AUTHORIZER OF INVOICES 
The person who engages in a purchases scheme is often the very person in the company 
whose duties include authorizing  purchases. Obviously, proper controls should preclude 
anyone from approving his own purchases. Such poorly separated functions leave little other 
than his conscience to dissuade an employee from fraud. Fraud arises in part because of a 
perceived opportunity. An employee who sees that no one is reviewing his actions is more 
likely to turn to fraud than one who knows his company works diligently to detect employee 
theft.

EXAMPLE 
A manager of a remote location of a large, publicly traded company was authorized to 
order supplies and approve vend or invoices for payment. For over a year, the manager 
routinely added personal items and supplies for his own business to orders made on behalf 
of his employer. The orders often included a strange mix of items. For instance, technical 
supplies and home furnishings might be purchased in the same order. Because the manager 
was in a position to approve his own purcha ses, he could get away with such blatantly 
obvious frauds. In addition to ordering personal items, the perpetrator changed the delivery 
address for certain supplies so that they would be delivered directly to his home or side 
business. This scheme cost the victim comp any approximately $300,000 in unnecessary 
purchases.  
 
In some situations, the perpetrator is authorized to approve purchases, but controls prevent 
him from also initiating purchase requests. This procedure is supposed to prevent an 
employee from purchasing personal items with company funds. Unfortunately, those with 
authority to approve purchases often have a good deal of control over their subordinates. 
These persons can use their influence to force subordinates to assist in purchases schemes. 
In other cases, the manager might simply initiate the purchase order himself by forging the 
subordinate’s signature.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Purchases for under $1,000 at a certain utility company could be made with limited value 
purchase orders (LPOs), which required the signatures of two people: the originator of a 
purchase request and the approver of the request. An LPO attached to an invoice for less 
than $1,000 would be paid by the accounts payable department. In this case, a manager 
bought goods and services on company accounts, and prepared LPOs for the purchases. (In 
some cases, the LPO would falsely describe the item to conceal the natu re of the purchase.) 
Once the LPO was prepared, the manager forced a clerk in his department to sign the 
document as the originator of  the transaction. The clerk, in timidated by her boss, did not 
question the authenticity of the LPOs. With two signatures affixed, the LPO appeared to 
be legitimate and the bills were paid. The sche me cost the victim company at least $25,000.
