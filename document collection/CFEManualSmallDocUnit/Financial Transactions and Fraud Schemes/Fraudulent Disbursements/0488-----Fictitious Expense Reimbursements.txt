Fictitious Expense Reimbursements  
Employees sometimes seek reimbursement for wholly fictitious expenses. Instead of 
overstating a real business expense or seeking reimbursement for a personal expense, an 
employee just invents an expense and requests that it be reimbursed. (See “Fictitious 
Expenses” flowchart.)
