COLLUSION WITH A SUPERVISOR 
The second way to obtain approval of a fraudulent timecard is to collude with a supervisor 
who authorizes timekeeping information. In these schemes, a supervisor knowingly signs 
false timecards and the employee kicks back a portion of the overpaid wages to the 
supervisor. In some cases, the supervisor may take the entire amount of the overpayment. It 
may be particularly difficult to detect payroll fraud when a supervisor colludes with an 
employee, because managers are often relied upon as a control to ensure proper 
timekeeping.  
 
EXAMPLE 
A supervisor assigned employees to better work  areas or better jobs, but in return she 
demanded payment. The payment was arranged by the falsification of the employees’ 
timecards, which the supervisor  authorized. The employees we re compensated for fictitious 
overtime, which was kicked back to the supervisor.
