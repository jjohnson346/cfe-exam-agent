Bank-Assisted Controls 
Companies should work in a cooperative effort with banks to prevent check fraud. Consider 
the following control measures that may be taken in regard to a firm’s checking accounts.  
• Establish maximum dollar amounts above which the company’s bank will not accept 
checks drawn against the account. 
• Use positive pay banking controls. Positive pay allows a company and its bank to work 
together to detect fraudulent items presented for payment. The company provides the 
bank with a list of checks and amounts that are written each day. The bank verifies items 
presented for payment against the company’s lis t. The bank rejects items that are not on 
the list. Investigations are conducted as to the origin of “nonlist” items.
