Re-Alteration of Checks 
In altered payee schemes, remember that it is common for the perpetrator to take a check 
intended for a legitimate recipient, then doctor the instrument so that the perpetrator 
becomes the designated payee. But a canceled check payable to an employee will obviously 
raise suspicions of fraud. Therefore, some employees re-alter their fraudulent checks when 
the bank statement arrives. It has already been discussed how employees can alter checks by 
writing the payee’s name in erasable ink when the check is prepared. These employees obtain 
a signature for the check, then erase the true payee’s name and insert their own. When the 
fraudulent checks return with the bank statement, the employee erases his own name and re-
 enters the name of the proper payee. Thus there will be no appearance of mischief.
