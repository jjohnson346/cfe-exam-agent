The following duties should be segregated:  
Financial Transactions  Asset Misappropriation: Fraudulent Disbursements 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.569 
• Payroll preparation 
• Payroll disbursement (into payroll and withholding tax accounts) 
• Payroll distribution  
• Payroll bank reconciliations 
• Human resource departmental functions 
 
If payroll is prepared by personnel not responsible for its distribution and reconciliation, it 
will be difficult for anyone to successfully add ghost employees. They will also be prevented 
from “borrowing” the trust account taxes because  they will not have access to the disbursing 
function. In smaller companies, this function is often handled outside the firm at pennies  
per employee. 
 
After the payroll checks are prepared, the transfer of funds from the general accounts to the 
payroll accounts should be handled by accounting. The personnel department should 
distribute checks and require identification in exchange for the payroll checks. This will 
curtail the opportunity to add ghost employees to the payroll. A suggested form of 
identification might be company-issued access passes, if available. 
 
If the bank reconciliation function for the payroll account is assigned to someone other than 
those in the above described functions, then all the payroll functions have been segregated. 
No one is able to add ghost employees or “borrow” the withholding taxes without the 
opportunity for discovery by someone else.
