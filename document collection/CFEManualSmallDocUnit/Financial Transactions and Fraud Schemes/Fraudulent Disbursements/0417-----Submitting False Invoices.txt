Submitting False Invoices 
Once a shell company has been formed and a bank account has been opened, the corrupt 
employee begins billing his employer. Invoices can be manufactured by various means such 
as a professional printer, a personal computer, or a typewriter. False invoices do not always 
have to be of professional quality to generate fraudulent disbursements. Typewritten 
invoices are often sufficient to generate checks.
