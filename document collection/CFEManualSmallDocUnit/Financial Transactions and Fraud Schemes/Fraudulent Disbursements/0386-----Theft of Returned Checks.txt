Theft of Returned Checks 
Checks that have been mailed and are later returned to the victim for some reason, such as 
an incorrect address, are often targeted for theft by fraudsters. Employees with access to 
incoming mail are able to intercept these returned checks and convert them by forging the 
endorsement of the intended payee.  
 
EXAMPLE 
A manager took and converted approximately $130,000 worth of checks that were 
returned due to noncurrent addresses (he also stole outgoing checks, cashed them, and then 
declared them lost). The fraudster was well known at his bank and was able to convert the 
checks by claiming that he was doing it as a favor to the real payees, who were “too busy to 
come to the bank.” The fraudster was able to continue with his scheme because the nature 
of his company’s business was such that the recipients of the misdelivered checks were often 
not aware that the victim company owed them  money. Therefore, they did not complain 
when their checks failed to arrive. In addition, the perpetrator had complete control over the 
bank reconciliation, so he could issue new checks to those payees who did complain, then 
“force” the reconciliation, making it appear that the bank balance and book balance 
matched when, in fact, they did not.
