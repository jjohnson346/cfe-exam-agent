Altering Checks Prepared by Others: “Tacking On” 
The other method that can be used by perpetrators to alter checks prepared by others is 
“tacking on” additional letters or words to the end of the real payee designation. For 
instance, checks payable to “ABC” company might be altered to read “A.B. Collins.” The 
employee then cashes the checks in the name of A.B. Collins. It sounds like an odd scheme, 
but it really happens. In these cases, the simple inclusion of a filler line after the payee 
designation would prevent the loss.  
 
In addition to altering the payee designation, the amount of the check can be altered by 
tacking on extra numbers if the person preparing the check is careless and leaves space for 
extra numbers in the “Amount” portion of the check.
