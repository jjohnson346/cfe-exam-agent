Overstated Refunds 
Rather than create an entirely fictitious refund, some employees merely overstate the amount 
of a legitimate refund and steal the excess money. For example, if a customer returns $100 
worth of merchandise, the employee might ring up a $200 return. The employee gives the 
customer $100 in return for the merchandise, then pockets the remaining $100. This will 
result in shrinkage of $100 worth of inventory.
