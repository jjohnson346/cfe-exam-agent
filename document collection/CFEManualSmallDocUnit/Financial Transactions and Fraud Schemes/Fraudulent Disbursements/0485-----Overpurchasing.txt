Overpurchasing  
Another way to overstate a reimbursement form is the “overpurchasing” of business 
expenses. This method is typically used by employees seeking reimbursement for travel 
expenses. Assume an employee is scheduled to make a business trip to another city. The 
employee purchases an airline ticket far in advance of the trip when rates are low. When it is 
close to the day of the trip, the employee purchases another ticket to the same destination. 
This ticket will be more expensive than the first one. To further jack up the price, the second 
ticket might include several stops and layovers on a very circuitous route. The employee 
removes the passenger receipt coupon from the second ticket then returns it for a full 
refund. He actually flies on the first (less expensive) ticket he purchased, but attaches the 
receipt from the more expensive ticket to his expense report.
