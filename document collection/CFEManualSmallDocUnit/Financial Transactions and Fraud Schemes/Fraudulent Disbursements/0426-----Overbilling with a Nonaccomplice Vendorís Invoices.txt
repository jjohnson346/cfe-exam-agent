Overbilling with a Nonaccomplice Vendor’s Invoices 
In most instances where an employee creates fraudulent invoices to overbill his employer, he 
uses a shell company. It is not as common for an employee to submit the invoice of an 
existing vendor. Nevertheless, in some instances an employee will undertake such a scheme 
by altering an existing vendor’s invoice or by  creating a counterfeit copy of a vendor’s 
invoice form.
