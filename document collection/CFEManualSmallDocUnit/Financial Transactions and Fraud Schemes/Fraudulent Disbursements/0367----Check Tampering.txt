Check Tampering
Check tampering is unique among the fraudulent disbursement schemes because it is the one 
group in which the perpetrator physically prepares the fraudulent check. In most fraudulent 
disbursement schemes, the culprit generates a payment to himself by submitting some false 
document to the victim organization such as an invoice or a timecard. The false document 
represents a claim for payment and causes the victim organization to issue a check that the 
perpetrator can convert.  
 
Check tampering schemes are fundamentally different. In these schemes the perpetrator 
takes physical control of a check and makes it payable to himself through one of several 
methods. Check tampering frauds depend upon factors such as access to the company 
checkbook, access to bank statements, and the ability to forge signatures or alter other

information on the face of the check. Most check tampering crimes fall into one of four 
categories: forged maker schemes, forged endorsement schemes, altered payee schemes, and 
authorized maker schemes.
