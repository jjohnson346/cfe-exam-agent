Insider Threats 
By far the greatest threat to information systems in terms of computer crime comes from 
employees inside an organization. It is not uncommon for operators, media librarians, 
hardware technicians, and other staff members to find themselves in positions of 
extraordinary privilege in relation to the key functions and assets of their organizations. A 
consequence of this situation is the probability that such individuals are frequently exposed 
to temptation. 
 
A further complication is the tendency on the part of management to tolerate less stringent 
supervisory controls over information system personnel. The premise is that the work is not 
only highly technical and specialized but difficult to understand and control. As an example, 
systems software support is often entrusted to a single programmer who generates the 
version of the operating system in use, establishes password or other control lists, and 
determines the logging and accounting features to be used. In addition, such personnel are 
often permitted, and sometimes encouraged, to perform these duties during non-prime shift 
periods, when demands on computer time are light. As a result, many of the most critical 
software development and maintenance functions are performed in an unsupervised 
environment. It is also clear that operators, librarians, and technicians often enjoy a degree

of freedom quite different from that which would be considered normal in a more 
traditional employment area.  
 
Insiders are typically aware of the holes in the system of internal controls and often exploit 
weaknesses just to see if they can get away with it. The most prevalent method of 
committing computer fraud is probably alteration or falsification of input transactions 
(and/or documents), including: 
• Alteration of input 
• Alteration of output 
• Data file manipulation 
• Communications systems 
• Operating systems 
• Computer operations
