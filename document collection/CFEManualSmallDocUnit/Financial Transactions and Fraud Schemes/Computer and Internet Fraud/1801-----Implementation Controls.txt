Implementation Controls 
Implementation controls are those controls over the development of, or purchase of, a new 
application. All new system requests should be made in writing. A system development life-
 cycle methodology should be used for developing and implementing in-house or purchased 
packages. All new systems requests should be approved by the appropriate management 
level. Users should be involved in the project from design through final testing. All test 
results should be approved by both data center management and user personnel. There 
should be an implementation plan for placing the new system into production.
