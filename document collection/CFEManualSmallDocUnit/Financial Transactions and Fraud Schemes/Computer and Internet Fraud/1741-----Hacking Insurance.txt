Hacking Insurance 
During the past three years, a handful of cyber-insurers have begun offering coverage 
specifically designed to address new forms of information age exposure. These e-commerce 
risks can include theft, damage or disclosure of data, denial of service attacks, theft of 
intellectual property, unauthorized access, loss of revenue, infringement of copyright and 
trademark, and the consequent damage to business reputation. These types of e-commerce 
risks are covered by what is known as first-party coverage. 
 
Third-party coverage covers the company if it is being sued for problems caused by 
technology product errors and omissions; the pilfering, public release, or misuse of sensitive 
or confidential information; the unwitting spread of disruptive viruses; hacker tampering to 
the information and advertising carried on websites; e-mail-facilitated sexual harassment; and 
privacy infringement. 
 
Many businesses believe that their traditional business coverage will suffice, or failing that, 
their Web host or ISP will cover damages caused by any of the above. In both cases, they are 
probably wrong. Unless your business insurance policy or Internet service level agreement 
specifically includes language addressing e-commerce liability, any damages will probably not 
be covered.
