Integrity of Evidence 
There are certain issues that must be considered when processing computer evidence. These 
areas should be considered regardless of whether the incident will be processed as a criminal 
offense for prosecution or possible civil litigation. Even if the organization decides to take 
no action at all, how a computer fraud examination is conducted might have potential civil 
liability implications for both the organization and/or the fraud examiner.  
 
Should the fraud examiner discover evidence on a computer system, he must be able to state 
unequivocally that the evidence was not changed in any way by their actions. This requires 
that strict forensic methodologies be followed to satisfy the stringent evidentiary standards 
necessary to ensure the integrity of the evidence “beyond a reasonable doubt” for possible 
court presentation. Therefore, fraud examiners must be aware of the following issues that 
relate to the gathering of computer evidence.
