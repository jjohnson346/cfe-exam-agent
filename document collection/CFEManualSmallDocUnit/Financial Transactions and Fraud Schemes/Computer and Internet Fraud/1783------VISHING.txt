VISHING 
Voice phishing, or Vishing, is the act of leveraging Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) 
technology in using the telephone system to falsely claim to be a legitimate enterprise in an 
attempt to scam users (both consumers and businesses) into disclosing personal information. 
Government, financial institutions, as well as online auctions and their payment services, can 
be targets of voice phishing.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1831 
A vishing scheme is generally transmitted as an incoming recorded telephone message that 
uses a spoofed (fraudulent) caller ID matching the identity of a misrepresented organization. 
The message uses an urgent pretext to direct unsuspecting users to another telephone 
number. The victim is invited to punch their personal information on their telephone 
keypad. The criminals capture the key tones and convert them back to numerical format. 
There are several types of information at risk from this type of scheme. This can include any 
numerical personal information: payment card information (numbers, expiration dates, and 
the last three digits printed on the signature panel), PIN (personal identification number), 
Social Security number, date of birth, bank account numbers, and passport number. 
 
Security experts have seen another variation of vishing where the criminals will leave a 
voicemail message or make telephone calls directing people to the bogus phone number. 
With Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and other Internet-based telephone technology, 
criminals can now make calls inexpensively and can mask their identity and their location 
and even make it look like they are calling from a legitimate company on caller displays. 
 
Some potential uses of the personal information that is gathered from victims includes 
control of the victim’s financial accounts; opening new bank accounts; transferring bank 
balances; applying for loans, credit cards, and other goods/services; making luxury 
purchases; hiding criminal activities; receiving government benefits; and obtaining a 
passport. 
 
Another version of vishing involves the sending of text messages to cell phones claiming the 
recipient’s online bank account has expired. The message instructs the recipient to renew 
their online bank account by using the link provided.
