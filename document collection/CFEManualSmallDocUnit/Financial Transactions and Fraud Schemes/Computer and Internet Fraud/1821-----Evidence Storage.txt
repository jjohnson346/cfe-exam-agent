Evidence Storage 
After a computer system has been seized, most criminal justice agencies have a central 
evidence storage facility where the equipment is transported and stored until it is either 
processed further or needed in court. In the majority of cases, the special storage 
requirements of computer systems are not addressed. 
 
The storage environment should be in a location that is: 
• Relatively dust-free 
• Both temperature and humidity controlled 
• Free of magnetic and electronic fields
