File Signatures 
When reviewing a directory listing in a file manager such as Windows Explorer, the “type” 
of file is one of the options that might display. This information might indicate that the file 
is an “application,” or that it is a “Word Document,” or some other type. However, this 
designation is usually based on the “extension” of the file, and might not be an accurate 
indication of the file contents.  
 
For example, if a file were created in Microsoft Word, and saved with the file name of 
“Murder Confession.doc,” the directory listing would correctly indicate that this file was a 
“Word Document.” However, if the file were renamed as “Angel.exe,” the directory listing 
would mistakenly indicate that the file was an “application,” even though the contents of the 
file itself have not changed.

Inspecting each and every file on seized media would be tremendously tedious and very 
time-consuming. However, there are utility programs that can automate this process and 
report any discrepancies such as the one described above.
