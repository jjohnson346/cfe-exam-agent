Handling the Evidence 
One of the major differences between investigating computer-related crimes and 
conventional criminal activities is the volatility of the evidence that resides in the computers 
themselves. Indeed, the evidence of a computer intrusion might be erased or altered as part 
of the intrusion itself. It is therefore very important for the organization and/or law 
enforcement personnel to deal quickly and decisively with evidence of suspected computer-
 related criminal activities. 
 
The admissibility of evidence obtained from computers in a court case is really no different 
from the admissibility of any other type of evidence. The evidence must be: 
• Relevant  
• Supported by a foundation for its introduction into court 
• Legally obtained 
• Properly identified 
• Properly preserved 
 
In the handling of computer data in criminal investigations, the examiner or investigators 
must be aware of some of the vulnerabilities of computer evidence: 
• The investigator must ensure that turning off power to computer equipment will not

destroy or erase evidence that is required for the investigation. 
• The read/write heads of hard disk drives must be parked in a retracted position so that 
powering down the disk drive will not cause the read/write head to contact the surface 
of the disk platter. 
• Be aware that magnetic storage media are vulnerable to magnetic fields and that evidence 
might be erased without the investigator being aware of the erasure if the media are 
brought close to a source of a magnetic field. 
• Be aware that other equipment attached to the computer might be needed to complete 
the investigation into the data that resides in the computer. 
• The investigator should write-protect all diskettes that are being used in the investigation 
so that they cannot be written upon inadvertently.
