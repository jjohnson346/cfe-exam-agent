Backdoors 
When attackers obtain root-level access to a server (using a buffer overflow exploit or a 
privilege escalation exploit, for example) they will want to do two things: 
• Install a backdoor  
• Cover their tracks  
 
Backdoors allow attackers to remotely access a system again in the future. For example, the 
attacker may have used a particular security hole to get root-level access to a computer. 
However, over time, that particular security hole may be closed, preventing the attacker from 
accessing the system again. In order to avoid being shut out in the future, attackers install 
backdoors. These backdoors take different forms, but all allow an attacker to access the 
server again without going through the standard log-in procedures and without having to 
repeat the attack that gave them access in the first place. Many worms install backdoors as a 
part of their malicious payload. Code Red II, for example, installed a backdoor that provided 
access to the C and D drives of the compromised Web server from anywhere on the 
Internet. Other common backdoor programs are Netbus and BackOrifice, which allow 
attackers to remotely control a compromised server. Once a backdoor is established, the 
hacker retreats and covers his tracks to keep the initial attack unnoticed.
