Stealth Viruses 
Stealth viruses are more sophisticated viruses. They constantly change their patterns in an 
effort to blend into the system. They attempt to avoid detection by bypassing DOS interrupt 
calls when they are installed, and remove their code from the infected files before the file is 
accessed by the requesting program. 
 
The 4096 virus is a type of stealth virus. It increases the file size by 4096 bytes and decreases 
the memory by approximately 6kb. The message “FRODO LIVES” might appear in the 
middle of the screen. If the infected file is run on September 21, it causes the system  
to crash.
