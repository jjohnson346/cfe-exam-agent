Chain Letters 
This fraud has once again become popular due to the Internet’s e-mail capabilities. Instead 
of sending numerous letters through the mail, as fraudsters were forced to do in the past, e-
 mail capabilities allow the fraudster to compose one letter and send thousands of copies to 
potential victims. The letter sent to unsuspecting targets generally forewarns of the grave 
dangers that await the target should he not reply to the letter. The letter asks for a small cash 
donation in exchange for the target’s piece of mind that no bad tidings will be spread, 
providing examples of some of the unfortunates who did not heed the letter. The money 
should be sent to a P.O. box, the e-mail often instructs.
