Fictitious Policies 
A salesman, in order to keep his position, submits fictitious policies to improve his writing 
record. Also prior to an individual leaving the company he writes fictitious policies called 
tombstone cases to improve his commission pool so that his compensation will be greater. 
Tombstone means an agent literally takes names from tombstones in a cemetery and writes 
new policies.
