Hit and Run 
The hit and run is a variation of the paper accident. The owner of a previously damaged 
vehicle calls the police and claims to be the victim of a hit and run accident. The resulting 
police report is used to file an insurance claim. This scheme may also be perpetrated after a 
single-car accident with no witnesses.
