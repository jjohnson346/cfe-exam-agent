Side Swipe 
The side swipe is a scheme that relies on opportunity. In a busy intersection with multiple 
left-turn lanes, the perpetrator makes the left turn over and over again, waiting for a driver to 
cross into his lane. When a driver finally does, the perpetrator purposely drives into the 
other car. Witnesses and police involvement are helpful to the perpetrator in this case.
