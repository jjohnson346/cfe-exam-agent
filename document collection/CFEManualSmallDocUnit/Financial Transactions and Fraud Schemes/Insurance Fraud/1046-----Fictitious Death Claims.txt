Fictitious Death Claims 
An agent or employee obtains a fictitious death certificate and requests that a death claim 
check be issued. The agent receives the check and cashes it. 
 
The sales representative can also write a fictitious application and, after the contestable 
period (two years), submit a phony death claim form and obtain the proceeds. The agent, by 
investing a couple of thousand dollars, could receive $50,000 or more in misappropriated 
claims.  
 
A company is particularly vulnerable to this scheme if the perpetrator has knowledge of the 
underwriting procedures such as the limits under which insurance can be written without a 
medical exam and what should be submitted on a death claim.
