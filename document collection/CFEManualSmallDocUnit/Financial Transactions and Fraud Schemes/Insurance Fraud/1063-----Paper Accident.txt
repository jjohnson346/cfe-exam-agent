Paper Accident 
This scheme involves the invention of an auto accident that only exists on paper. When the 
repair costs are less than $1000, many insurance companies don’t bother to send an 
investigator to examine the vehicle. Because this is a low-risk endeavor, and no police are 
involved, this scheme is very popular within organized crime rings.
