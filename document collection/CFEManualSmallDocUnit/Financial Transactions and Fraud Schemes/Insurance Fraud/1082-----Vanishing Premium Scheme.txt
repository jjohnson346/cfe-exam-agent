Vanishing Premium Scheme 
This scheme involves insurance companies marketing deceptive “vanishing premium” life 
insurance policies. The idea of the “vanishing premium” policy is that, after a set number of 
years of paying the policy’s premium, the policy would be paid off. At that point the policy 
holder would not have to make any more payments toward the policy. 
 
In reality, though, around the time the policy would be paid off, the insurance company 
would explain that the policy had been revised, and that several more years of payments 
would be necessary. The policy holder would then be faced with a dilemma: either cease 
making payments and risk having the policy lapse due to non-payment, or continue making 
the expensive payments for several more years.
