UNDERSTATEMENT OF PAYROLL 
The premium for a specific job classification is based on the total payroll for that 
classification. The employer may understate the amount of the payroll for higher risk 
classifications. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Two men in Massachusetts pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and mail fraud in 
connection with a fraudulent scheme to re duce workers’ compensation claims for a 
construction company. The men falsely reported that workers in high-risk trades were 
engaged in less dangerous occupations in order to lower premiums. They also concealed 
millions of dollars on the company payroll from the insurance company, thereby avoiding 
workers’ compensation payments on those dollars. 
 
EXAMPLE 
A Boise couple found themselves responsible for a $71,049 judgment after being accused of 
misreporting payroll in their drywall business. Two former employees tipped off investigators 
that they were being paid with checks bearing different company names. 
 
Half of their payroll money was paid by an insured drywall company, and the other half 
came from one that was not insured. Workers’ compensation claims came from the 
company that was paying premiums.
