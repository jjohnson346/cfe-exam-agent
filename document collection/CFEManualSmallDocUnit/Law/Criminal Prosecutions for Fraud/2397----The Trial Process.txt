The Trial Process 
Under the Sixth Amendment, the accused is entitled to a “speedy and public trial, by an 
impartial jury, in the state and district wherein the crime [was] committed …” In federal 
courts, the Speedy Trial Act mandates that the defendant be indicted within 30 days of arrest 
and tried within 70 days of notice of the charges, excluding delays caused by certain 
enumerated circumstances. If the time limits are not adhered to, the court may dismiss the 
case with or without prejudice, depending on the circumstances.
