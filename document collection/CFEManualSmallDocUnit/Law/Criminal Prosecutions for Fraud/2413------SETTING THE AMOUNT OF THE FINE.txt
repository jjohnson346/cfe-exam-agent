SETTING THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE 
When an organization is convicted of a federal offense, the fine it must pay is determined by 
Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud  Law 
2.526  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
calculating the “base fine” and any culpability multiplier. First, the base fine is arrived at by 
determining the greatest of: 
• The amount from the offense level fine table 
• The pecuniary gain to the organization from the offense 
• The pecuniary loss from the offense caused by the organization, to the extent the loss 
was caused intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly 
  
The fine amounts on the base offense level fine table range from $5,000 to $72,500,000. 
Next the court calculates the appropriate multipliers for the base fine level, depending on the 
particular circumstances. Factors that are considered include: 
• Involvement in or tolerance of criminal activity 
• History 
• Whether the organization violated a judicial order or injunction during the offense 
• The existence of an effective program to prevent and detect violations of law 
• Any self-reporting, cooperation, and acceptance of responsibility 
• Obstruction of justice by the organization 
 
The culpability score is then converted to a multiplier that generates the recommended fine 
range. The court will consider a number of additional factors to determine where in the 
range the actual fine will be imposed. An organization must be ordered to serve a period of 
probation if the court finds that: 
• It is necessary to secure payment of restitution, to enforce a remedial order, or to ensure 
completion of community service 
• If a monetary penalty is ordered and has not been paid at the time of sentencing and 
probation is necessary to ensure payment 
• It is necessary to ensure that changes are made to reduce the likelihood of crime 
• It is necessary to accomplish Sentencing Act purposes 
• If the defendant organization sentence does not include a fine 
 
The length of probation may not exceed five years. In addition, the court has discretion to 
order the defendant organization to publicize its conviction and the nature of the offense. 
The court also may order the organization to make periodic reports to the court or the 
probation department and subject itself to unannounced examinations of its books and 
records. Finally, the court may order the organization to develop and submit for court 
approval an effective compliance program.
