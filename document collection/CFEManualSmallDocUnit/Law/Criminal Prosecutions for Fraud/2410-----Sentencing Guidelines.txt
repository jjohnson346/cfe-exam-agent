Sentencing Guidelines 
The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 provided for the development of guidelines for the 
sentencing of individual and organizational offenders. The individual guidelines became 
effective in 1987, and the guidelines for organizations in 1991. In April 2010, the U.S. 
Sentencing Commission modified sentencing guidelines for organizations, especially as they 
relate to compliance programs. The changes will become effective on November 1, 2010, 
barring any Congressional modifications or rejection.
