Individual Guidelines 
Under the guidelines, sentencing determinations are made by cross-referencing the base offense 
level assigned to a particular offense with the “defendant’s criminal history category.” There 
are 43 basic offense levels (murder and treason being level 43 offenses) and six criminal 
history categories. Adjustments may be made up or down in each table based on the 
particular facts and circumstances of the case. For example, the base offense level for crimes 
involving fraud or deceit is six, but if the fraud involved a loss of more than $2,000, more 
than minimal planning, or other aggravating circumstances, the base offense level can be

substantially increased. The final applicable offense level is then coordinated with the 
criminal history category of the defendant (which is computed on a point basis according to 
the number and type of previous convictions and other factors) to arrive at the final 
sentencing level. The court may depart from the recommended sentence if unique factors 
are present, but any such departure must be supported by specific reasons. 
 
As an example, a defendant with no prior convictions convicted of fraud involving the loss 
of $10,000 would be sentenced to a term of four to 10 months, absent unusual 
circumstances. If the fraud resulted in the loss of $1 million, involved more than minimal 
planning, and was perpetrated by a defendant who had a previous conviction punishable by 
more than a year in prison, the recommended term of imprisonment would be 41 to 51 
months. Under the Sentencing Act, the defendant will serve a substantial amount of the 
sentence he receives (a small reduction is possible for good behavior); the Sentencing Act 
abolished parole in federal cases.
