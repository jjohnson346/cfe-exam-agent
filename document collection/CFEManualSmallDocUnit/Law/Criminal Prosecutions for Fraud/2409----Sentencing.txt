Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud

Sentencing 
Following a guilty verdict, the judge must impose a sentence without unnecessary delay. 
Prior to the sentencing hearing, a probation officer will prepare a pre-sentence report that 
will review the defendant’s character, background, associates, prior criminal record, and 
other factors relevant to setting an appropriate sentence. The report will recommend a

particular sentence or range of sentence. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure require 
that the pre-sentence report contain a victim impact statement, that is, an assessment of the 
financial, social, psychological, and medical impact upon, and cost to, the victim of the 
crime. This information may be used to set the punishment or to support a possible 
restitution order. The defendant and his counsel are allowed to review all or parts of the 
probation report except the sentencing recommendation. 
 
At the sentencing hearing, the defendant, counsel, and the prosecutor may be heard before a 
sentence is imposed. The court may impose a fine, a term of imprisonment, or both, or place 
the defendant on probation for a specified period and under certain conditions. The court 
may order restitution to the victims in addition to a fine or prison term, or as a condition of 
probation. A federal statute provides that a defendant who has been found guilty of fraud 
may be ordered to give notice to the victims, apparently to protect the public from further 
fraudulent acts by the defendant and to alert the victims to the possibility of civil recoveries. 
 
Sentences of imprisonment for two or more offenses may be ordered to run consecutively 
or concurrently, depending on the nature and severity of the offenses and other factors. In 
federal court, a defendant may be fined up to twice the pecuniary gain realized from the 
crime, or twice the loss sustained by the victim as an alternative to the statutory amounts.
