Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud

Opening Statements 
Once the jury is selected and sworn, and after some introductory remarks by the judge, the 
actual trial begins with the opening statements. The opening statements allow each side to 
present their positions to the jury; it lets them outline the evidence they will present and 
what the evidence will prove. In general, the prosecution presents its opening statement first. 
In it, the prosecutor usually explains the charges, outlines the evidence he intends to 
produce, and tells the jury that the prosecution will ask for a verdict of guilty. The 
prosecutor is not permitted to argue the case at this point; that will be done at the end. The 
defense counsel then gives an opening statement, although on occasion it will wait until the 
defense case begins.
