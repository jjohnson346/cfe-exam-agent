Corporate Deferred Prosecution Agreements 
Generally, deferred prosecution agreements occur when prosecutors file criminal charges 
against a company, but then agree not to prosecute the claims as long as the company 
successfully complies with the deferral agreement’s terms. Essentially, deferred prosecution 
agreements help companies avoid indictment, trial, and conviction while providing 
prosecutors with another channel for disposing a corporate case that punishes malfeasance 
and effectuates changes in a company’s culture.
