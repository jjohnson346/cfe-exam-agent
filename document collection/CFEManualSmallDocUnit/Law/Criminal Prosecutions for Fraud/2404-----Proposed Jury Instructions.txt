Proposed Jury Instructions  
At the close of the evidence, the jury usually is temporarily discharged and the parties meet 
with the judge to submit proposed jury instructions to the court. Usually, jury instructions 
are read to the jury after closing arguments, and the instructions will include such matters as 
the basic elements of the charges, the definition of reasonable doubt, the prosecution’s 
burden, and, if requested by the defense, the warning that no adverse inference may be 
drawn from the failure of the defendant to testify. Some defense attorneys, however, do not 
request adverse inference instructions because they believe it merely reminds the jury of the 
accused’s failure to explain or defend his conduct. 
 
Each side is entitled to instructions on the law supporting its theory of the case if there is 
any credible evidence in its favor even if there is substantial evidence to the contrary. If a 
request to instruct the jury is denied, a party must object and state the grounds for its 
objection before the jury retires to preserve its right to appeal. This is an extremely 
important point for defense counsel because jury instruction errors provide fertile ground 
for reversals on appeal.
