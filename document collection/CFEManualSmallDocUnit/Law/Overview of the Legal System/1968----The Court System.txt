Overview of the Legal System

The Court System 
Civil and criminal cases will be filed in either state or federal court. The power to hear a case 
and render a judgment is strictly limited to a court’s jurisdiction, which is defined both by 
geographic boundaries and by the specific powers granted to it by the legislature. This reflects 
the basic constitutional principle of separation of powers among the three branches of 
government: the legislature, elected popularly, enacts the laws; the executive (e.g., state or 
federal prosecutors) enforces them (with a great deal of discretion); and the judiciary 
interprets and applies them.
