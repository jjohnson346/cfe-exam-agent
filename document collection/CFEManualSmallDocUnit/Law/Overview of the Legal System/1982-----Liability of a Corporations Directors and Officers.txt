Liability of a Corporation’s Directors and Officers 
The current legal environment imposes civil and criminal liabilities on a corporation’s directors 
and officers. Generally, director and officer liability stems from the certain duties imposed by 
law to their corporation. The duties, which are discussed in more detail below, are as follows: 
• Duty of loyalty. Directors and officers must act solely in the best interest of the 
employer/principal, free of any self-dealing, conflicts of interest, or other abuse of the 
principal for personal advantage. 
• Duty of care. Directors and officers must conduct business affairs prudently with the skill 
and attention normally exercised by people in similar positions. 
• Statutory duties. Numerous state and federal laws regulate directors’ and officers’ actions 
and decisions regarding the management of their companies, including: securities laws, 
antitrust laws, racketeering laws, tax laws, intellectual property and patent laws, and state 
corporation laws.  
 
Even though directors and officers may be pursued in criminal proceedings, criminal law 
often imposes mens rea (i.e., intent) requirements that generally make it more difficult to 
impose criminal liability on directors and officers.
