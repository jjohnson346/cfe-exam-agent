E-MAIL 
Unlike traditional business letters written on formal letterhead, e-mails are more prone to 
authenticity issues and may be more difficult to properly authenticate. For example, the judge 
in Lorraine v. Markel, 241 F.R.D. 534 (D. Md. 2007) refused to allow either party to offer e-mails
of an arbitration negotiation as evidence, finding that neither party authenticated the e-mails 
by simply attaching them to their motions as exhibits.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.711 
E-mail authenticity issues usually arise because e-mail systems are unreliable and inherently 
unsecure, making e-mails susceptible to alteration. Moreover, e-mails can lack reliability 
because the identities of senders can be corrupted through unauthorized access and use.  
 
Even so, there are numerous ways e-mail can be authenticated, including:  
• Witness with personal knowledge (e.g., a witness testifies that he recognizes a copy of an 
e-mail that he received or drafted) 
• Comparison with authenticated examples (e.g., if one e-mail has been properly 
authenticated, a second e-mail could by authenticated by comparing it with the first) 
• Circumstantial evidence of distinctive characteristics (e.g., the presence of a party’s name 
and e-mail address or the presence of metadata) 
• Trade inscriptions purporting to have been affixed in the course of business and 
indicating ownership, control, or origin (e.g., an automatic business signature at the end of 
the e-mail) 
• Certified copies of business records (e.g., e-mail is accompanied by a written certification 
by its custodian)
