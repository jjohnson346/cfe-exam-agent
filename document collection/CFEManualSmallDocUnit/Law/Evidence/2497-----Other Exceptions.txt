Other Exceptions 
Miscellaneous exceptions to the hearsay rule include things like dying declarations  and ancient 
documents. For those instances not specified in any rule, there remains the judge’s discretion: 
Anything the judge deems trustworthy for the purposes of its presentation is admissible. This is 
the cornerstone of the rule. Hearsay is excluded in the first place because it supposedly lacks 
trustworthiness. However, other kinds of hearsay that do not fall within any specific hearsay 
exceptions may be admissible if they meet the same standards of trustworthiness as required 
for the listed exceptions.
