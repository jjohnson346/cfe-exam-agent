Hearsay 
Simply put, hearsay refers to a statement that repeats what some other person said while 
outside of court. FRE 801 defines hearsay as “a statement, other than one made … at the trial 
or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” Basically, hearsay 
involves the following elements: 
• A statement (anything intended to be an assertion; statements can be oral, written, or 
nonverbal conduct, such as nodding a head) 
• That is made outside the court’s supervision (statements made at trial or during deposition are 
not hearsay because they are made during court proceedings, but a statement made at 
work or at a crime scene is outside the court’s supervision and could be hearsay if the 
other elements are also present) 
• That is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (a party is offering a statement to prove the 
truth of the matter asserted if the party is trying to prove that the assertion made by the 
declarant [the person who made the out-of-court statement] is true) 
 
This sets apart virtually anything said outside the courtroom or outside an officially 
designated function of the court such as a deposition.  
 
Under the general rule, hearsay is not admissible in court, but this rule is subject to numerous 
exceptions. Excluding hearsay on one level means witnesses cannot say, “He said … she

2.718  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
said.” Each person testifies to his own experience.  This is designed to protect the credibility 
and condition of testimony and to preserve each side’s right to cross-examine witnesses.  
 
Each witness in the trial will be questioned about personal, firsthand encounters. Unless their 
statements satisfy one of the exceptions discussed below, witnesses will speak only about 
things they have experienced themselves. If possible, evidence should be presented in the 
courtroom so that the jury can determine the weight to give each piece of evidence.  
 
The hearsay rule often creates admissibility issues for electronically stored information (ESI) 
because such evidence is often made out of court and offered to prove the truth of the matter 
asserted.
