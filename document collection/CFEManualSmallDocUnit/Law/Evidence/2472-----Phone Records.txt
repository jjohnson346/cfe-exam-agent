Phone Records 
To be admitted into evidence, phone records  must meet the business records authentication test. 
However, investigators must also be aware of the federal Telephone Records and Privacy 
Protection Act of 2006 (TRPPA), which criminalizes the practice of obtaining and attempting 
to obtain confidential phone record information through pretexting (gaining access through 
the use of false statements) unless it is otherwise permitted by law. Violations of the Act are 
criminal, and if convicted, a violator faces up to 10 years in prison and up to $100,000 in 
fines.
