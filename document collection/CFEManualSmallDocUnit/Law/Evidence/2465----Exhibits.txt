Evidence


:


Exhibits 
Exhibits are the tangible objects presented as evidence. Therefore, both real evidence and 
demonstrative evidence are entered into the record as exhibits. This includes documents such 
as contracts, letters, and receipts, as well as photographs, X-rays, baseball bats, knives, 
fountain pens and computer files. In short, anything that is not testimony is an exhibit. 
Testimony is what people say. Exhibits are the “props.”
