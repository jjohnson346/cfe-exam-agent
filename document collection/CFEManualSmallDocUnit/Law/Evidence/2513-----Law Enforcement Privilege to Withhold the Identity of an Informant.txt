Law Enforcement Privilege to Withhold the Identity of an Informant 
Law enforcement agencies may legitimately withhold the identity of an informant unless 
disclosure is necessary to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial. In such circumstances, 
the prosecution has to decide whether to forego prosecution or disclose the identity of the 
informant. In the private sector, there is no equivalent privilege. Certified Fraud Examiners or 
others who are investigating on behalf of a private client may be compelled by court order to 
disclose the identity of an informant or any other witness. This possibility should be disclosed 
to potential witnesses who may request confidentiality. See the Investigation Section of the 
Fraud Examiners Manual for more information.
