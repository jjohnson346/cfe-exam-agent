Introduction 
There are certain evidentiary privileges that protect certain types of evidence from being 
discovered or produced. Invoking a privilege for a piece of testimony or other evidence in a 
legal encounter keeps the material outside trial proceedings. If a privilege applies, the court 
and its petitioners are denied access to the privileged information, and judges and juries must 
disregard any evidence they do actually hear if it is deemed privileged afterward.  
 
The most important privileges are discussed below.
