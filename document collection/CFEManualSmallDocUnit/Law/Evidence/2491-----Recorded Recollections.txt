Recorded Recollections 
A memorandum or record may be admissible if it concerns a matter that the witness once had 
knowledge of but now has forgotten, if it was made or adopted by the witness when the 
matter was fresh in memory, and if it is shown to be accurate. Such memoranda or records 
also may be shown to a witness who has temporarily forgotten the events to refresh the 
witness’s recollection and allow the testimony to be more complete or accurate.
