Statement Against Interest 
A statement against interest is a special form of admission in which a prior statement is at odds 
with the declarant’s current claim. To be admissible under this exception, the statement must 
meet three requirements:  
• The declarant must be unavailable to testify. 
• The statement must have been against important interests of the declarant when made. 
• Corroborating circumstances must clearly establish the trustworthiness of the statement. 
 
In prosecuting a tax evasion charge, for example, prosecutors may present a financial 
statement used by the defendant to obtain a loan; this is a statement against interest because 
the document declares a higher net worth than the defendant now claims to have.
