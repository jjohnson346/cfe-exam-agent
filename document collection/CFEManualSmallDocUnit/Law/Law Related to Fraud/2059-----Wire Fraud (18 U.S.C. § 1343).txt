Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) 
The wire fraud statute is similar to the mail fraud statute. Generally defined, wire fraud is the 
use of wire communications to perpetrate a scheme to defraud a victim of money or 
property. The text of the statute provides: 
 
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining 
money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, 
transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in 
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of 
executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 
twenty years, or both. If the violation affects a financial institution, such person shall be fined 
not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both. 
 
The wire fraud statute often is used in tandem with mail fraud counts in federal 
prosecutions. Unlike mail fraud, however, the wire fraud statute requires an interstate or 
foreign communication for a violation.
