Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1790b) 
The Federal Credit Union Act (FCUA) established the federal credit unions system and 
provides for the supervision of federal credit unions. The FCUA contains anti-retaliation 
and anti-discrimination provisions that protect credit union and National Credit Union 
Administration employees who provide information to a government body about possible 
legal violations by credit unions or by the directors, officers, or employees of credit unions.

To bring an anti-retaliation claim under the FCUA, an employee should file a civil action in 
federal court within two years of the retaliation. However, when initiating such action, the 
employee must also file a copy of the complaint with the National Credit Union

damages, and “other appropriate actions to remedy any past discrimination.”
