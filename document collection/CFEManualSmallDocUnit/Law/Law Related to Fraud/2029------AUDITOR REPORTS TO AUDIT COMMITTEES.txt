AUDITOR REPORTS TO AUDIT COMMITTEES 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 301 requires that auditors report directly to the audit committee, and 
section 204 makes certain requirements as to the contents of those reports. To help ensure 
that the audit committee is aware of questionable accounting policies or treatments that were 
used in the preparation of the company’s financial statements, Sarbanes-Oxley section 204 
states that auditors must make a timely report (before any report is filed with the SEC 
pursuant to the federal securities laws) of the following to the audit committee:  
• All critical accounting policies and policies used 
• Alternative GAAP methods that were discussed with management, the ramifications of 
the use of those alternative treatments, and the treatment preferred by the auditors 
• Any other material written communications between the auditors and management
