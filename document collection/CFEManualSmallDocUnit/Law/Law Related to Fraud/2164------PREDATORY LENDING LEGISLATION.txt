PREDATORY LENDING LEGISLATION  
Predatory lending is a term generally used to characterize a range of abusive and aggressive 
lending practices, including deception and fraud, without any benefit to the borrower. 
Although a few federal laws implicate predatory mortgage-lending practices, the only act 
Congress enacted specifically to address predatory lending was section 32 of the Truth in 
Lending Act, entitled the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA) (5 U.S.C. § 1639).  
 
Note: The rules of HOEPA protect refinancing and home equity installment loans; they do 
not protect loans to buy or build a home, reverse mortgages, or home equity credit lines.  
 
HOEPA attempts to regulate certain high-cost, potentially predatory mortgage loans, and its 
protections are triggered by home loans that 1) have an annual percentage rate (APR) that is 
eight percent higher than an index tied to Treasury securities or 2) have fees that exceed 
eight percent of the loan total or $583, whichever is greater. However, predatory lenders 
easily evade HOEPA’s protections by imposing charges and fees just below the threshold. 
Thus, very few predatory loans are subject to HOEPA’s regulations. 
 
On July 18, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board approved a rule under HOEPA to protect 
consumers from unfair or deceptive home mortgage lending and advertising practices. The 
rule will take effect on October 1, 2009, and will specifically: 
• Prohibit creditors from extending credit without considering the borrowers’ ability to 
repay; 
• Require creditors to verify income and assets they rely upon in making a loan; 
• Restrict the circumstances under which prepayment penalties are permitted; and  
• Require creditors to establish escrow accounts for taxes and insurance.
