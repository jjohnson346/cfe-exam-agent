CIVIL ACTION FOR TRADE SECRET THEFT 
A victim of theft of trade secrets may file a civil action for damages or request an injunction 
under a variety of federal and state statutes. Civil damages include reimbursement for actual 
losses caused by the defendant, such as lost profits, reimbursement of development expenses 
and overhead costs, and the cost of efforts to protect the secret or recover damages, as well 
as for reduction in the value of business. Damages also can be measured by the defendant’s 
profits, which may be ordered to be paid to the plaintiff. Punitive damages and attorney’s 
fees also may be awarded. 
 
In addition to or in lieu of monetary damages, the plaintiff in a civil action for theft of trade 
secrets also may obtain an injunction prohibiting further use of the information. To obtain 
an injunction, the plaintiff must demonstrate that: 
• It is the proper owner of the trade secret 
• An unauthorized person has taken or used the trade secret 
• There is a high probability of improper disclosure 
• The plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury (meaning that the plaintiff could not be 
adequately compensated by monetary damages) 
• The plaintiff probably will win the case 
 
Injunctions have been issued in numerous trade secret cases to prevent the use of stolen 
information, to prohibit an employee in possession of a trade secret from accepting 
employment with a competitor, or to order the wrongdoer to return the misappropriated 
information. The injunction usually prohibits use of the trade secret only for that period it 
would have been required for its legitimate independent development. However, injunctions 
are difficult to obtain.
