THEFT OF TRADE SECRETS (18 U.S.C. § 1832) 
Section 1832 is concerned with conventional commercial theft and misappropriation of trade 
secrets. It principally covers domestic crimes. In addition to three standard elements of 
espionage, which were discussed above, a section 1832 action requires the government to 
prove the following three additional elements:  
• That the accused intended to convert the trade secret to the economic benefit of 
someone other than the rightful owner;  
• That the accused intended to injure the owner of the trade secret; and 
• That the trade secret was related to or included in a product that is produced for or 
placed in interstate or foreign commerce.  
 
As evidenced by the additional elements, the requirements for prosecution under section 
1832 are somewhat stricter than under section 1831. For example, section 1832 requires that 
the defendant have intended for someone to gain by the misappropriation, whereas section 
1831 prosecutions can succeed even when the benefits of a theft are noneconomic.  
 
The maximum punishments for an offense under section 1832 are 10 years imprisonment, a 
fine, or both. If the offense is committed by an organization, the fine can run as high as 
$5,000,000. Attempts and conspiracies to commit the domestic theft of trade secrets are also 
punishable under section 1832.
