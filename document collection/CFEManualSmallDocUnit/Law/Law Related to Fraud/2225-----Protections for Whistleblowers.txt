Protections for Whistleblowers 
Many whistleblowers are employees of the government contractor on which they are 
blowing the whistle. Obviously, employees might be reluctant to report their employer to the 
government for fear of retaliation. To address this concern, Congress provided substantial 
protections to whistleblowers. Title 31 U.S.C. section 3730(h) prohibits an employer from 
taking any adverse action (including discharge, demotion, or harassment) against an 
employee “because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others 
in furtherance of an action under this section, including the investigation or initiation of, 
testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section.”

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.341 
If an employer takes adverse action against the employee, the employee can seek relief 
against the employer including reinstatement at the same seniority status, an award of two 
times the employee’s back pay plus interest, and any other special damages required to make 
the employee whole. The employee also can receive reimbursement for all the costs of the 
litigation, including attorneys’ fees. 
 
Although these provisions provide necessary and justifiable protection for employees, in 
some cases they have the unintended effect of preventing an employer from firing or taking 
any other action against a whistleblower, even if there is adequate cause. Employers often are 
unwilling to implement any negative employment decision (no matter how justifiable) against 
a whistleblower for fear that the employee will add a claim of retaliation to the suit. 
The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act (FERA), which was signed into law on May 20, 
2009, enhanced the whistleblower protections under the False Claims Act by making these 
retaliation claims available to government contractors and agents.
