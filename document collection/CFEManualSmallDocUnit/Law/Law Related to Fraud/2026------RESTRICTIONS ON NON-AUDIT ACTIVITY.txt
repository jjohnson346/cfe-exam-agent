RESTRICTIONS ON NON-AUDIT ACTIVITY 
Perhaps the greatest concern arising out of the public accounting scandals of 2001 and 2002 
was the fear that public accounting firms that received multimillion-dollar consulting fees 
from their public company clients could not maintain an appropriate level of objectivity in 
conducting audits for those clients. To address this concern, Congress established section 
201, which provides a list of activities that public accounting firms are now prohibited from 
performing on behalf of their audit clients. The prohibited services include:  
• Bookkeeping services 
• Financial information systems design and implementation 
• Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contribution-in-kind reports 
• Actuarial services 
• Internal audit outsource services 
• Management functions or human resources 
• Broker or dealer, investment adviser, or investment banking services 
• Legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit 
• Any other service that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board proscribes 
 
There are certain other non-audit services — most notably tax services — that are not 
expressly prohibited by Sarbanes-Oxley. In order for a public accounting firm to perform 
these services on behalf of an audit client, however, that service must be approved in 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.222  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
advance by the client’s audit committee, which must be disclosed in the client’s periodic SEC 
reports. Furthermore, regarding non-audit services, the SEC prevents accounts from 
providing audit clients with expert opinions and services, as well as legal representation for 
advocating the audit client’s litigation, regulatory, or administrative interests.
