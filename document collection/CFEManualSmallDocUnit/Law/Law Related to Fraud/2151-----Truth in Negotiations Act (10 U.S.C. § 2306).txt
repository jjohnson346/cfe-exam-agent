Truth in Negotiations Act (10 U.S.C. § 2306) 
In 1962, Congress enacted TINA to protect the government from unscrupulous contractors 
that inflate costs by falsifying their cost proposals with inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent 
cost and pricing data.  
 
Under TINA, if a government contractor submits defective information that results in the 
price being artificially inflated and the government relies on it, the government is entitled to 
a reduction in the contract price to eliminate the effect of its reliance on the defective data. 
 
In instances where a contractor unknowingly submits defective data (i.e., defective data 
submitted for non-fraudulent reasons, such as negligence, accident, incompetence, or 
mistake), the government is entitled to a dollar-for-dollar price reduction in the contract 
price to eliminate the effect of its reliance on the defective data. If, however, defective data is 
knowingly submitted, TINA provides for not only a dollar-for-dollar price reduction, but 
“an additional amount equal to the overpayment.”
