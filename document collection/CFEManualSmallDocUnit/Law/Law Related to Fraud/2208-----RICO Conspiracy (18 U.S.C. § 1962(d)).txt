RICO Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 1962(d)) 
Section 1962(d) prohibits conspiring to violate any criminal provisions under the Racketeer 
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Unlike the general conspiracy statute, a 
conspiracy under section 1962(d) does not require some overt act on the defendant’s part.
