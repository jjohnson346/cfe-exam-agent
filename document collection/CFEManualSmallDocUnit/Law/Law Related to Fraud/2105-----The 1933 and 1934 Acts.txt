The 1933 and 1934 Acts 
Section 17(a) of the 1933 Act makes it unlawful to employ fraudulent devices or 
misrepresentations in connection with the offer or sale of securities through jurisdictional 
facilities (e.g., the U.S. mail), whereas Rule 10b-5 prohibits the same conduct “in 
connection” with the “purchase or sale” of any security by “any person.” Because Rule 10b-
 5 has the broadest reach — including insider trading — it is the most often used.  
 
More specifically, a successful 10b-5 action requires the plaintiff to allege and prove the 
following four elements: 
• The defendant made a material misstatement or omission 
• The defendant acted with scienter (typically meaning that the party charged with the 
violation acted with a specific intent to defraud) 
• The plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation or omission in the purchase or sale of a 
security 
• The plaintiff suffered economic loss caused by the purchase or sale of the security 
 
To bring a successful insider trading claim under Rule 10b-5, however, the government must 
prove all of the following elements: 
• The defendant bought or sold securities in a company. 
• At the time of purchase, the defendant was in possession of non-public, material 
information.  
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.256  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• The defendant was an insider of the company (e.g., an employee), a “constructive 
insider” (i.e., someone who is temporarily en trusted with confidential information), a 
tippee (i.e., someone who receives information from an insider), or an outsider who gets 
the information from a temporary insider.  
• The defendant traded “by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate 
commerce or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange.” 
 
To allow action under Rule 10b-5, the false statement must be material. The test for 
materiality is whether there is a substantial likelihood under all the circumstances that a 
reasonable investor would have considered the misstated or omitted facts significant in 
deciding whether to invest. Materiality is most often expressed in dollar terms or in terms of 
its effect on financial statements. Materiality, however, might relate to serious questions of 
management’s integrity regardless of the dollar amount involved. 
 
Specific intent to defraud is an essential element of a violation of section 17(a) and Rule 10b-
 5. However, intent to defraud  is defined more broadly in securities regulations than in other 
areas of common-law fraud, and it includes reckless statements, as well as the knowing 
circulation of half-truths and false opinions or predictions that elsewhere might be 
considered non-actionable puffing. To prove liability against a corporation, a plaintiff must 
show that an agent of the corporation made the alleged false statements with specific intent 
to defraud, and both the fraudulent act and required mental state are attributable to the 
corporation. 
 
Good faith is always a defense to a section 17(a) or Rule 10b-5 fraud action. However, intent 
can be — and usually is — proved by circumstantial evidence, as in any fraud case. Violations 
of other indirect anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws (such as certain 
registrations and disclosure requirements) do not require a showing of fraudulent intent. 
 
SEC civil actions often are settled by consent decrees in which the party agrees to stop the 
offending practice without admitting or denying he engaged in it in the first place. Violations 
of such decrees may be punishable as contempt with jail terms or fines.
