AUDITING, QUALITY CONTROL, AND INDEPENDENCE STANDARDS AND RULES 
Section 103 of the Act requires the PCAOB to establish standards for auditing, quality 
control, ethics, independence, and other issues relating to audits of publicly traded 
companies. Although the Act places the responsibility on the PCAOB to establish audit 
standards, it also sets forth certain rules that the PCAOB is required to include in those 
auditing standards. Among these rules are:  
• Audit work papers must be maintained for at least seven years.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.217 
• Auditing firms must include a concurring or second partner review and approval of audit 
reports, as well as concurring approval in the issuance of the audit report by a qualified 
person other than the person in charge of the audit. 
• All audit reports must describe the scope of testing of the company’s internal control 
structure and present the auditor’s findings from the testing, including an evaluation of 
whether the internal control structure is acceptable and a description of material 
weaknesses in internal controls and any material noncompliance with controls. 
 
Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the PCAOB, in conjunction with the 
Security Exchange Commission (SEC), has promulgated several rules requiring compliance 
with additional auditing standards. Because these rules are extensive and ever-changing, 
auditors should periodically review the SEC’s website for updates and new rules at 
http://sec.gov/rules/final.shtml.
