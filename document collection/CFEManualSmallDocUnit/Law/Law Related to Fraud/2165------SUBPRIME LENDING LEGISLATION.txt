SUBPRIME LENDING LEGISLATION  
Subprime lending  is the practice of extending credit to borrowers who have certain credit 
characteristics — such as a lower credit score or poor payment history—that disqualify them 
from loans at the prime rate. Currently, there is no federal legislation governing subprime 
lending. But Congress has recently introduced a variety of legislative proposals designed to 
address the problems faced by subprime borrowers. For instance, the rules under HOEPA 
issued by the Federal Reserve Board are designed to increase borrower protections from 
abusive lending practices. The regulations would, among other things, limit various acts and 
practices in mortgage loans with annual percentage of rates exceeding a lower trigger.
