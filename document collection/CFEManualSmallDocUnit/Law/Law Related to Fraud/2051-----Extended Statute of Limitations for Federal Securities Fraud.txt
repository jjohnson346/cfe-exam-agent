Extended Statute of Limitations for Federal Securities Fraud 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also amended the statute of limitations for several securities fraud 
claims. Section 804 of the Act extends the statute of limitations to the earlier of two years 
after the discovery of facts constituting fraud or five years after such violation. Prior to the 
Act, the statute of limitations was the earlier of one year after the discovery of facts 
constituting fraud or three years after such violation.  
 
However, the extended statute of limitations only applies to causes of action involving “a 
claim of fraud, deceit, manipulation, or contrivance.” Even though litigation has arisen over 
the types of claims subject to the extension, it is clear that section 804 extends the statute of 
limitations for section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims.
