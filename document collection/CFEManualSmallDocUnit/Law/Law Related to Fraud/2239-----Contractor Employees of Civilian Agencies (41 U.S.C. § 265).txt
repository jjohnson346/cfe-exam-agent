Contractor Employees of Civilian Agencies (41 U.S.C. § 265) 
Section 265(a) of Title 41, U.S. Code, provides whistleblower protections for employees of 
civilian contractors with federal agencies by prohibiting government contractors from 
discharging or otherwise retaliating against an employee for reporting employer contract 
violations “to a Member of Congress or an authorized official of an executive agency or the 
Department of Justice.” Section 265(b) provides that such complaints are to be filed with the 
Inspector General of the executive agency or, if the agency does not have an Inspector 
General, to the official designated by the head of the executive agency. However, the statute 
does not include any right to private action for individuals who believe they have been 
aggrieved and, in fact, indicates that no private right exists under the section.  
 
Under this law, an employee who brings a successful claim is entitled to reinstatement and

compensatory damages, including back pay. Additionally, section 265 “permits any aggrieved 
party to appeal the agency head’s order to the appropriate United States Court of Appeals 
within 60 days.”
