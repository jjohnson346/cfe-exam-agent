Conspiracy 
Criminal conspiracy punishes an agreement between two or more people to commit an 
illegal act. The crime of conspiracy is actually a separate criminal offense, meaning that the 
underlying crime (e.g., bank fraud, bribery, securities fraud, etc.) and the conspiracy to 
commit the underlying crime are two separate offenses. The U.S. Code contains numerous 
specific conspiracy statutes throughout its text, and this section examines some of the most 
relevant conspiracy statutes.
