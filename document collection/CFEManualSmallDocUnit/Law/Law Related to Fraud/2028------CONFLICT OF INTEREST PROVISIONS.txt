CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROVISIONS 
Another provision of Sarbanes-Oxley aimed at improving auditor independence is section 
206, which seeks to limit conflicts or potential conflicts that arise when auditors cross over 
to work for their former clients. The Act now makes it unlawful for a public accounting firm 
to audit a company if, within the prior year, the client’s CEO, CFO, controller, or chief 
accounting officer worked for the accounting firm and participated in the company’s audit.
