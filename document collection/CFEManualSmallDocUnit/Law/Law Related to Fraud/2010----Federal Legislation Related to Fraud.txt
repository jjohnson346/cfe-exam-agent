Federal Legislation Related to Fraud 
Under our federal system, the prosecution of most white-collar crimes, such as 
embezzlement, larceny, and false pretenses, is left to the states. Prosecution under the 
criminal fraud statutes in the U.S. Code requires a federal jurisdictional basis, such as an 
effect on interstate commerce or mail uses. The U.S. laws often are used to prosecute the 
larger and more serious crimes primarily because of the generally superior resources of 
federal law enforcement agencies and their nationwide jurisdiction. 
 
All federal criminal laws are the product of statutes. Statutes vary widely from a statute that 
prohibits unauthorized use of the “Smoky the Bear” emblem to the criminal provisions of 
the antitrust laws. The most important of the hundreds of federal laws, rules, and regulations 
are listed below.
