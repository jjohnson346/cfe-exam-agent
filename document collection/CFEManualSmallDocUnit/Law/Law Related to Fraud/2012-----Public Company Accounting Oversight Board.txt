Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 101 establishes the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.215 
(PCAOB), whose purpose is: 
 
[T]o oversee the audit of public companies that are subject to the securities laws, and related matters, in 
order to protect the interests of investors and further the public interest in the preparation of informative, 
accurate, and independent audit reports for companies the securities of which are sold to, and held by and 
for, public investors. 
 
In short, the PCAOB is charged with overseeing public company audits, setting audit 
standards, and investigating acts of noncompliance by auditors or audit firms. The PCAOB 
is to be appointed and overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which 
is part of the Executive branch. It is to be made up of five persons, two who are or have 
been CPAs and three who have never been CPAs. The PCAOB members, which are 
appointed by the SEC, can only be removed by the SEC for cause. 
 
The Act lists the PCAOB’s duties, which include: 
• Registering public accounting firms that audit publicly traded companies 
• Establishing or adopting auditing, quality control, ethics, independence, and other 
standards relating to audits of publicly traded companies 
• Inspecting registered public accounting firms 
• Investigating registered public accounting firms and their employees, conducting 
disciplinary hearings, and imposing sanctions where justified 
• Performing such other duties as are necessary to promote high professional standards 
among registered accounting firms, to improve the quality of audit services offered by 
those firms, and to protect investors 
• Enforcing compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the rules of the PCAOB, 
professional standards, and securities laws relating to public company audits 
 
Recently, the Supreme Court considered a constitutional challenge to the PCAOB in Free 
Enterprise Fund v. Public Comp any Accounting Oversight Board, et al. In this case, the Free 
Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit public interest organization, and a Nevada accounting firm 
sued the PCAOB seeking an order that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act violates the U.S. 
Constitution.  
 
The main issue raised by the suit concerned whether SOX violated the separation of powers 
doctrine by the manner in which the PCAOB’s members are selected and removed. To 
review, the separation of powers doctrine precludes each of the three branches of 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.216  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
government (legislative, executive, and judicial) from interfering upon the domain of the 
other two branches. In particular, the plaintiffs argued that SOX is unconstitutional because 
the PCAOB’s members are impermissibly insulated from presidential oversight, noting that 
the members are appointed by, and can only be removed for cause by, the SEC and not the 
president. 
 
In its opinion, the Supreme Court ruled that, because the President lacks the power to fire 
the Board members, the current method for removing PCAOB members violated the 
separation of powers principles. The Court detailed that the “buck stops” with the President, 
and, therefore, a clear and effective chain of command must be in place. “By granting the 
Board executive power without the Executive’s oversight [SOX] subverts the President’s 
ability to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed — as well as the public’s ability to pass 
judgment on his efforts. The Act’s restrictions are incompatible with the Constitution’s 
separation of powers…. Congress cannot limit the President’s authority in this way.”  
 
Despite ruling that the provision violated the Constitution, the Court allowed SOX to 
remain “fully operative as a law.” It also said that, to bring the PCAOB into compliance with 
the Constitution, the SEC must be given the ability to remove the Board members at will. 
Thus, PCAOB may continue to function without any for operational changes or legislative 
action.
