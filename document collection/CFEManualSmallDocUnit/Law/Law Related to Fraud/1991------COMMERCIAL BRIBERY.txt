COMMERCIAL BRIBERY 
In contrast, commercial bribery refers to the corruption of a private individual to gain a 
commercial or business advantage. Commercial bribery may be prosecuted either as a criminal 
act or by a civil action. About half of the states in the U.S. have criminal statutes that 
prohibit commercial bribery. If a state does not have a commercial bribery statute, 
commercial bribery schemes can usually be prosecuted under criminal fraud statutes on the 
theory that the payment of a commercial bribe defrauds the business owner of the right to 
an employee’s unbiased and loyal services. 
 
There is no federal statute prohibiting commercial bribery, but such offenses may be 
prosecuted at the federal level as mail or wire fraud, as a RICO violation, or as a violation of 
some other law. The elements of commercial bribery vary by jurisdiction, but typically 
include: 
• Giving or receiving 
• A thing of value 
• With intent to corruptly influence 
• A business decision 
• Without the knowledge or consent of the principal 
 
The “without the knowledge or consent of the principal” element is included on the theory 
that a private business owner is not defrauded if the owner knows of or allows employees to 
accept gifts, favors, or other payments from vendors or other business contacts. 
 
Most state commercial bribery statutes are misdemeanors punishable by a jail term of no 
more than one year. Commercial bribery is a felony in Colorado, Kansas, Texas, Arizona (if 
the value of the bribe payment is $100 or more) and New Hampshire (if the value of the 
bribe is $500 or more). The New York commercial bribery law is a typical statute that makes 
it a misdemeanor to give or receive (or to offer or solicit) “any benefit” without the consent 
of the employer, with the intent of influencing the employee’s business conduct. The 
Louisiana, Michigan, and New Jersey commercial bribery statutes confer immunity on the 
party to the scheme who first agrees to testify against the other party in a criminal 
proceeding. 
 
Businesses injured by commercial bribery schemes may sue for treble damages and attorneys’ 
fees under the Civil RICO statute (Title 18 U.S. Code Section 1964) and the Clayton 
Antitrust Act (Title 15 U.S. Code Section 13(c)), and for compensatory and punitive

damages for common law fraud, conflict of interest, and breach of fiduciary duty. Civil 
actions may be brought even if commercial bribery is not a crime in a jurisdiction.
