Concealment of Material Facts 
An action for fraud may be based on the concealment of material facts, but only if the 
defendant had a duty in the circumstances to disclose. The essential elements of fraud based 
on failure to disclose material facts are: 
• That the defendant had knowledge 
• Of a material fact

2.204  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• That the defendant had a duty to disclose 
• And failed to do so 
• With the intent to mislead or deceive the other party 
 
The duty to disclose usually depends on the relationship between the parties. Those people 
who occupy a special relationship of trust, such as the officers or directors of a corporation, 
an attorney, accountant, trustee, stockbroker, or other agent, may be found to have a duty to 
completely disclose material facts to the parties who rely upon them. Statutes might expand 
the duty to disclose to areas in which traditionally there was no such duty, such as to the 
sellers of personal or real property or to the purchasers or sellers of securities. 
 
Proof that the concealed fact was material probably is the most important element in a 
concealment case; there can be no liability if  the withheld information would not have 
affected the other party. In addition to fraudulent concealment, a defendant might also be 
liable for negligent failure to discover and disclose material facts. An accountant, for 
example, might be liable for failure to discover or report material facts in a financial 
statement or audit. Of course, as with neg ligent misrepresentation, the penalties are less 
severe for negligence than fraudulent misrepresentation, and there is no criminal liability.
