INTERNAL CONTROLS PROVISION  
The internal controls provision is designed to prevent unauthorized or unrecorded 
transactions. Under the internal controls provision, a company must maintain robust 
compliance policies and must take reasonable steps to ensure that its affiliates maintain 
suitable internal controls. 
 
The SEC has considered several factors to determine the adequacy of a system of internal 
controls. The factors include:  
• The role of the board of directors 
• Communication of corporate procedures and policies 
• Assignment of authority and responsibility 
• Competence and integrity of personnel 
• Accountability for performance and compliance with policies and procedures 
• Objectivity and effectiveness of the internal audit function
