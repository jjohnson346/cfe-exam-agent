Misappropriation of Trade Secrets 
Misappropriation is the intentional, illegal use of the property, funds, or ideas of another 
person for an unauthorized purpose. In the fraud context, misappropriation claims generally

involve trade secrets or other proprietary information. 
 
Trade secret includes not only secret formulas and processes, but also more mundane 
proprietary information, such as customer and price lists, sales figures, business plans, or any 
other confidential information that has a value to the business and would be potentially 
harmful if disclosed. 
 
Theft or misappropriation of trade secrets may be prosecuted under a variety of federal and 
state statutes and the common law. The definition of what constitutes a trade secret depends 
on the organization, industry, and jurisdiction, but the following three characteristics are 
common to most definitions: 
• The information is not generally known to the relevant portion of the public. 
• It confers some sort of economic benefit on its holder (where this benefit must derive 
specifically from its not being generally known, not just from the value of the 
information itself). 
• It is the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. 
 
The elements of a typical theft of trade secret claim are: 
• That a party possessed information of value to the business 
• The information was treated confidentially 
• That the defendant took or used the information by breach of an agreement, confidential 
relationship, or other improper means 
 
An organization can only maintain legal protection over its trade secrets if it takes reasonable 
steps to keep that information secret. Thus, it is critical that the information being sought to 
be protected was treated confidentially, although absolute secrecy is not required; it is 
sufficient if the information was “substantially” undisclosed. Limited disclosure to people 
with a need to know or pursuant to confidentiality agreements will not void the secret. 
Methods of demonstrating that information was intended to be kept confidential include a 
written policy describing the information as proprietary or secret; strict limitations on 
distribution of the information; and physically securing the information to prevent 
unauthorized access and use. 
 
The owners of the information also should enforce restrictive agreements and act promptly 
to remedy any inadvertent disclosures. Failure to do so might be construed as a waiver of 
confidentiality and make it impossible to prevent future use or disclosures.
