CRIMINAL SANCTION WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION  
Sarbanes-Oxley section 1107—codified at 18 U.S. C. § 1513 — makes it a crime to knowingly, 
with the intent to retaliate, take any harmful action against a person for providing truthful 
information relating to the commission or possible commission of any federal offense. This 
protection is only triggered when information is provided to a law enforcement officer. It 
does not apply to reports made to supervisors or to members of Congress, as is the case 
under Sarbanes-Oxley section 806.  
 
In general, the coverage of Sarbanes-Oxley section 1107 is much broader than the civil 
liability whistleblower protections of Sarbanes-Oxley section 806. While the Sarbanes-Oxley 
section 806 protections apply only to employees of publicly traded companies, Sarbanes-Oxley 
section 1107’s criminal whistleblower protections cover all individuals (and

2.226  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
organizations) regardless of where they work. Also, Sarbanes-Oxley section 806 only applies 
to violations of securities laws or SEC rules and regulations, whereas Sarbanes-Oxley section 
1107 protects individuals who provide truthful information about the commission or 
possible commission of any Federal offense.  
 
Violations of Sarbanes-Oxley section 1107 can be punished by fines of up to $250,000 and 
up to 10 years in prison for individuals. Corporations that violate the Act can be fined up to 
$500,000.
