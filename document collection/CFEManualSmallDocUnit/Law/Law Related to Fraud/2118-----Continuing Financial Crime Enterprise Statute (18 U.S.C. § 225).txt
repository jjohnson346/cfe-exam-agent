Continuing Financial Crime Enterprise Statute (18 U.S.C. § 225) 
Also known as the “S&L Kingpin” statute or the “Financial Crime Kingpin Statute,” 
Congress enacted this law in response to the late 1980s savings and loan scandal, in which 
numerous factors such as market forces and criminal activity within saving and loan 
institutions led to the collapse of the savings and loan industry. Primarily concerned with 
punishing financial institution related crimes, the Financial Crime Kingpin Statute 
criminalizes the administration of a continuing financial crimes enterprise.  
 
A criminal enterprise is a series of violations of enumerated crimes related to financial 
institutions that were committed by at least four persons acting in concert. According to 
most courts, a series is three violations. 
 
Punishment under the Financial Crime Kingpin Statute is severe. The law provides for fines 
of up to $20 million for organizational defendan ts, as well as fines of up to $10 million and 
up to life imprisonment for individual defendants receiving $5,000,000 or more during a 24-month 
period from a criminal enterprise.
