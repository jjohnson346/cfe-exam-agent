Bank Fraud (18 U.S.C. §§ 1344, 1345) 
Title 18, U.S. Code, section 1344 is the broadest of all bank fraud statutes. It punishes those 
obtaining assets owned or controlled by a bank by false or fraudulent pretenses, 
representations, or promises. It covers both insiders and all other persons, even if not 
affiliated with the bank. It also applies to check kiting and to offshore frauds (extraterritorial 
reach). Bank fraud is a predicate offense under the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt 
Organization statute. Penalties for bank fraud include a fine of up to $1,000,000 and/or 
imprisonment of up to 30 years.  
 
In a related provision, section 1345 allows the government to commence a civil action in 
federal court to enjoin fraudulent activity that violates section 1344. 
 
As in the mail and wire fraud statutes, the terms scheme and artifice to defraud include any 
misrepresentations or other conduct intended to deceive others to obtain something of 
value. The prosecution must prove only an attempt to execute the scheme. It need not show 
actual loss, that the victim institution was deceived, or that the defendant personally 
benefited from the scheme.
