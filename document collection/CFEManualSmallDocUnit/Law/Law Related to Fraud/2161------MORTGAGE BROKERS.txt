MORTGAGE BROKERS 
Historically, mortgage loans were originated by the loan officer at the bank. Mortgage 
lenders, however, started relying on third-party originators (TPOs) to broker their loan 
products. Brokers could be paid a commission rather than a salary, an option that worked 
well for minimally capitalized mortgage lenders.  
 
As a result, the industry has seen the evolution of mortgage brokers.  
 
As markets for mortgages became more competitive, banks with their own retail loan 
officers also started employing these third-party wholesale originators. Today, mortgage 
brokers are the largest distributors of mortgage products for mortgage lenders and banks. It 
is estimated that two-thirds of all originations are from wholesale TPO mortgage brokers 
rather than retail loan officers.
