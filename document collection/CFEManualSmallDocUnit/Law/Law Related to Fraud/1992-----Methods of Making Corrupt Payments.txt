Methods of Making Corrupt Payments 
In bribery schemes, the thing of value  is not limited to cash or money. Any tangible benefit 
given or received with the intent to corruptly influence the recipient may be an illegal 
payment. Courts have held that such things as lavish gifts and entertainment, payment of 
travel and lodging expenses, payment of credit card bills, loans, promises of future 
employment, and interests in businesses, can be bribes if they were given or received with 
the intent to influence or be influenced. Some state statutes might distinguish between 
felonies or misdemeanors according to the amount of illegal payment.
