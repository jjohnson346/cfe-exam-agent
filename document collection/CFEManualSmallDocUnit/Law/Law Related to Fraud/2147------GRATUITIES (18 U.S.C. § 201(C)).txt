GRATUITIES (18 U.S.C. § 201(C)) 
Gratuities include giving a government employee something of value because of his official 
position. However, unlike the bribery offense, there is no requirement for the government to 
prove that the gratuity was given for the purpose of influencing any official act. Illegal 
gratuity violations carry only a maximum two-year term, fine, or both.
