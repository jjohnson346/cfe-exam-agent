Major Fraud Act (18 U.S.C. § 1031) 
Congress enacted the Major Fraud Act to provide federal prosecutors with an additional 
criminal statute that targeted major procurement fraud committed against the United States. 
The Act contains a whistleblower protection clause in section 1031(h), providing that any 
individual who is discharged, demoted, harassed, or otherwise mistreated by their employer 
as a result of the individual’s cooperation in the prosecution of offenses under the Act may 
obtain reinstatement, two times the amount of back pay due, and other damages, including 
litigation costs and attorneys’ fees. There is no federal statute of limitations expressly 
applicable to a federal cause of action under section 1031(h), and in such instances, courts 
generally apply the most closely analogous statute of limitations under state law. Section 
1031(g)(1) of the Major Fraud Act authorizes the attorney general to pay up to $250,000 in 
certain circumstances for information regarding possible prosecutions under this section.
