Non-Appropriated Fund Employees (10 U.S.C. § 1587) 
Section 1587 of Title 10, U.S. Code, prohibits persons subject to this regulation from taking 
retaliatory action against a civilian employee, paid from non-appropriated funds, of the 
Armed Forces for disclosing information of a violation or “mismanagement, a gross waste of 
funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.”  
 
Employees who believe they were subject to retaliatory action should file their section 1587 
complaint with the inspector general of the Department of Defense (IG DoD), which will 
then determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant an investigation. If 
investigation is warranted, the IG DoD conducts the investigation of reprisal allegations. 
Upon completing the investigation, the IG DoD reports its findings, conclusions, and 
recommendations to the Director of Administration and Management, who is responsible 
for adjudicating reprisal complaints and directing appropriate corrective action.
