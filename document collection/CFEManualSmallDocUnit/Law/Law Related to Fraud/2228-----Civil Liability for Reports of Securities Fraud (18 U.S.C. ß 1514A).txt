Civil Liability for Reports of Securities Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1514A) 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 806 creates 18 U.S.C. § 1514A, a statute that creates civil liability for 
companies that retaliate against whistleblowers. It should be noted that this provision does 
not provide universal whistleblower protection; it only protects employees of publicly traded  
companies. Section 1514A makes it unlawful to fire, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in 
any other manner discriminate against an employee for providing information or aiding in an 
investigation of securities fraud. However, the statute requires that the employee must report 
the suspected misconduct to a federal regulatory or law enforcement agency, a member of 
Congress or a committee of Congress, or a supervisor. Employees are also protected against 
retaliation for filing, testifying in, participating in, or otherwise assisting in a proceeding filed 
or about to be filed relating to an alleged violation of securities laws or SEC rules. 
 
The whistleblower protections apply even if the company is ultimately found not to have 
committed securities fraud. As long as the employee reasonably believes he is reporting 
conduct that constitutes a violation of various federal securities laws, then he is protected. 
The protections not only cover retaliatory acts by the company, but also by any officer, 
employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of the company.  
 
To assert a section 806 retaliation claim, an employee must file a complaint with either the 
secretary of labor or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) area 
director within 90 days of the alleged retaliatory action, which generally occurs when the 
complainant receives notice of the adverse action. The Act further provides that if a final 
decision has not been issued within 180 days of the complaint filing and there is no showing 
that the delay is due to the claimant’s bad faith, the complaining party may bring a private 
claim in an appropriate federal district court.  
 
Whether a complainant’s 806 claim is heard through the administrative channel or by a 
district court, the elements of proof are the same. The complainant must prove by a 
preponderance of the evidence that (1) the employee engaged in a protected activity or 
conduct; (2) the employer knew that the employee engaged in protected activity; (3) the 
employee suffered an unfavorable personal action; and (4) the protected activity was a

contributing factor in the unfavorable personal action. However, even if the complainant 
proves each of these elements, the employer may avoid liability by demonstrating by clear 
and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action 
even in the absence of such protected activity. 
 
If a public company is found to have violated section 1514A, the Act provides for an award 
of compensatory damages sufficient to “make the employee whole.” Penalties include 
reinstatement; back pay with interest; and compensation for special damages including 
litigation costs, expert witness fees, and attorneys’ fees.
