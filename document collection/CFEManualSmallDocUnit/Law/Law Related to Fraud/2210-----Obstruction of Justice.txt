Obstruction of Justice 
The obstruction of justice statutes punish efforts to impede or obstruct the investigation or 
trial of other substantive offenses. Prosecutors usually are pleased to discover such violations 
because they add a more sinister flavor to what might be colorless white-collar charges and 
help to prove underlying criminal intent. In many instances, these charges draw the stiffest 
penalties. 
 
There are several obstruction statutes in the federal code, including 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503 
(influencing or injuring officer or juror generally), 1504 (influencing a juror through a 
writing), 1506 (theft or alteration of a record or process), 1509 (obstruction relating to court 
orders), 1512 (tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant), 1516 (obstruction of a 
federal audit), and 1517 (obstructing the examination of a financial institution).  
 
In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 set forth increasingly important obstruction of 
justice provisions concerning fraud examinations. The Act amended section 1512 to include 
document destruction by the accused and instituted two of the most significant criminal 
statutes addressing obstruction of justice: 18 U.S.C. § 1519 and 18 U.S.C. § 1520.  
 
An examination of every obstruction statute, however, is beyond the scope of this text. 
Therefore, this section focuses on the obstruction statutes most relevant to fraud
