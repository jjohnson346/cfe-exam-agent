Obstruction of Federal Audit (18 U.S.C. § 1516) 
This statute, originally passed in 1988, makes it a felony for anyone to influence, obstruct, or 
impede a federal auditor in the performance of his official duties. Although the “influence, 
obstruct, or impeded” language employed by the statute is broad, the government rarely 
employs this statute.
