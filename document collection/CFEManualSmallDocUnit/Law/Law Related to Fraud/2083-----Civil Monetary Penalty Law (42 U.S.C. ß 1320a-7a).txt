Civil Monetary Penalty Law (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a) 
The Civil Monetary Penalty Law (CMPL) was passed to impose administrative sanctions 
against providers who defraud any federally funded program by filing false claims or other 
improper billing practices. Any person (including an organization, agency, or other entity, 
but excluding a beneficiary) that presents or causes to be presented a claim for a medical 
service or other item or service that the person knows or should know is false or fraudulent 
is subject to a civil monetary penalty.

participation in government programs.

• Falsified contractor qualifications 
• False certifications or assurances 
• False records or invoices 
• Invoices from nonexistent companies 
• Claims made in duplicate or altered invoices 
• Billing for fictitious employees
