Employee’s Rights During the Investigation 
While the employee has a duty to cooperate, the employee also has certain other rights that 
define the scope of that duty. Employee rights, however, vary from case to case, generally 
depending on the employee’s contractual rights, applicable federal and state statutes, and 
constitutional protections. Thus, before beginning any fraud examination, it is important for 
the fraud examiner to determine the employee’s rights.
