Miranda Warnings 
Designed to protect an individual’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, 
Miranda warnings advice suspects that they have the right not to answer questions and the 
right to legal counsel during interrogations. Miranda warnings are required only if a person is 
being interrogated by public authorities in a custodial setting. Custodial setting refers to 
questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody, 
or otherwise deprived of his freedom or action in any significant way. As a result, both 
private and public employers might interview employees in noncustodial settings without 
giving Miranda warnings. 
 
In subsequent civil proceedings, an adverse inference might be drawn from silence in 
response to questioning.
