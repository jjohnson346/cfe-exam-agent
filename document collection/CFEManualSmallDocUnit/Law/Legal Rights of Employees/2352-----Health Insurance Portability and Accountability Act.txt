Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (Public Law 104–191, Partially Codified in 45 C.F.R. §§ 160, 164) 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) instituted several privacy 
rules concerning personal health information. While most of the rules do not directly affect 
investigations, fraud examiners should be aware of the rules because they may have an 
impact on the type of information that can be legally gathered on employees.  
 
The HIPAA privacy rules place restrictions on the availability and use of “protected health 
information.” The definition of this term is extremely broad and covers any information 
relating to an individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health, payment for 
services, or health care operations. For example, a cancer center employee who stole a

patient’s identification information to obtain credit cards violated HIPAA. This case marked 
a significant point in HIPAA legislation because it had more to do with identity theft than 
actual health information, yet it was still covered under the statute. 
 
If information about the health of an individual, or payments for services, becomes an issue 
during an investigation, the examiners should immediately contact the human resources 
(HR) department, which should have information about whether the entity is subject to the 
HIPAA rules and can assist you in compliance with those rules.  
 
The most important thing to note is that if the HIPAA rules apply, the party seeking the 
information is restricted as to the type of health information it can access without specific 
written authorization. Examiners should never contact the health care provider, the health 
plan administrator, or a medical billing services for copies of employee records without first 
consulting the employer’s legal counsel or HR department.
