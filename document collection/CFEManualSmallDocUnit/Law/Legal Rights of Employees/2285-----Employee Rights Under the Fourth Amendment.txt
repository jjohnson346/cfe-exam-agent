Employee Rights Under the Fourth Amendment  
The Fourth Amendment is the principal constitutional limitation on searches and seizures by 
public authorities. It states: 
 
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against 
unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon 
probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be 
searched, and the persons or things to be seized. 
 
In short, the Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. That is, it 
prohibits public employers from unreasonably invading their employees’ privacy to conduct 
a workplace search, and it prohibits unreasonable surveillance of employees (such as 
videotaping or wiretapping) where they would reasonably expect privacy.
