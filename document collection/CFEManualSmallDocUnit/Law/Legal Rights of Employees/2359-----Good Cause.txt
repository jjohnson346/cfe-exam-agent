Good Cause 
Before discharging an employee, it is best to document in the employee’s file that the 
employer has “good cause” to terminate employment. Although there is no exact definition 
of “good cause,” there are several questions that the company should ask before terminating 
an employee: 
• Did the employee know that the conduct would be subject to discipline? 
• Was the rule the employee violated reasonably related to the safe, efficient, or orderly 
operation of the business? 
• Did the company investigate to discover whether the employee violated the rule? 
• Did the company conduct a fair and objective investigation? 
• Did the company obtain significant evidence of a violation? 
• Was the decision nondiscriminatory? 
• Was the discipline related to the seriousness of the offense and the prior record of the 
employee? 
 
If the company feels that discharge of the employee is likely, it should make sure that the 
employee’s actions and the company’s actions  are well documented and placed in the 
employee’s personnel file.
