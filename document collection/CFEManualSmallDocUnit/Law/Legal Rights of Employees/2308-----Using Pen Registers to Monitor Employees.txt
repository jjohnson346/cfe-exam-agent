Using Pen Registers to Monitor Employees 
In general, section 3121 prohibits the installation of pen registers without a court order, but 
there are a number of exceptions under which employers can use pen registers to track their 
employees’ phone activity. Those exceptions include: 
• Phone service providers can use pen registers to protect users (employers) from abuse of 
service or unlawful use of service.  
• Phone service providers can use a pen register to record the fact that a phone call was 
initiated or completed to protect users of the service (employers) from fraudulent, 
unlawful, or abusive use of the service.  
• Phone service providers can use a pen register where consent of the user of the service 
has been obtained.
