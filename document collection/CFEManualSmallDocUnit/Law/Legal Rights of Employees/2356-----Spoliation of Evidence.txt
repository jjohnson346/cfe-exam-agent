Spoliation of Evidence 
Spoliation of evidence is broadly defined as the act of destroying evidence or making it 
otherwise unavailable. The act of spoliation can surface in just about any type of case, 
criminal or civil, and by any party, plaintiff, or defendant. The theory behind spoliation of 
evidence presumes that the individual who makes evidence unavailable following the 
probable initiation of a lawsuit is aware of its detrimental effect upon a case. 
 
Although few jurisdictions have a separate cause of action for spoliation of evidence, almost 
every jurisdiction allows for sanctions resulting from such acts. Some courts require the

spoliation to be intentional, though others merely require negligence or reckless spoliation.  
 
Intentional spoliation claims usually involve elements similar to the following: (1) the 
existence of a potential lawsuit; (2) the defend ant’s knowledge of the potential lawsuit; (3) 
the destruction, mutilation, or significant alteration of potential evidence; (4) intent on the 
part of the defendant to disrupt or defeat the lawsuit; (5) a causal relationship between the 
act of spoliation and the inability to prove the lawsuit; and (6) damages. 
 
Negligent spoliation claims generally occur when a party unintentionally loses evidence 
valuable to his claim, or a third party loses or destroys evidence in a suit. An example of the 
required elements for a negligent spoliation claim include: (1) existence of a potential civil 
action; (2) a legal or contractual duty to preser ve evidence which is relevant to the potential 
civil action; (3) destruction of that evidence; (4) significant impairment in the ability to prove 
the lawsuit; (5) a causal relationship between the evidence destruction and the inability to 
prove the lawsuit; and (6) damages.
