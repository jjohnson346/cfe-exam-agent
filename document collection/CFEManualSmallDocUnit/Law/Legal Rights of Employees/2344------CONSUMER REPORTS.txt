CONSUMER REPORTS  
For the FCRA to apply, the information that is being obtained must be a “consumer report.” 
A consumer report  is defined as any written, oral, or other communication by a consumer-reporting 
agency bearing on a customer’s cred it worthiness, credit standing, character, 
general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living. 
 
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which is the federal agency responsible for 
enforcement of the FCRA, has interpreted this to mean basically any information collected 
on a person. It does not refer to just credit reports. It would also apply to public records 
such as criminal records and DMV searches. 
 
But in general, when faced with the question of whether a specific report is a consumer 
report, courts have focused on the purpose for which the person or organization collected 
the consumer information.
