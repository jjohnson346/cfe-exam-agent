THE PROVIDER EXCEPTION  
The provider exception allows suppliers of wire or electronic communications services (e.g., 
telephone, voice mail, e-mail, or Internet services) to intercept or access electronic 
communications in the normal course of business. For example, telephone providers can 
monitor phone calls when it is necessary to maintain and protect the system, run quality 
control checks, or to protect the service against theft or harassment. Most courts hold that 
employers qualify as providers with respect to their internal e-mail and voice mail systems.
