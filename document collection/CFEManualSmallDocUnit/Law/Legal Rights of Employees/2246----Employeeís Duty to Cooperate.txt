Employee’s Duty to Cooperate 
A duty to cooperate exits in every employer/employee relationship. Some states have 
statutes defining the scope of this duty, while in others, the duty is found to be implied from 
the basic nature of the employment relationship. For instance, California Labor Code section 
2856 states that an employee “shall substantially comply with all directions of his employer 
concerning the service on which he is engaged” unless compliance is impossible, unlawful, 
or would impose unreasonable burdens on the employee.  
 
The duty to cooperate extends to workplace investigations; therefore, employees have a duty 
to cooperate during an internal investigation as long as what is requested from them is 
reasonable. 
 
What is reasonable will be determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case 
and by the duties for which the employee was hired. For example, if inventory items were 
missing, it would probably be reasonable to request that a warehouse supervisor review 
inventory records because this falls within the scope of his work duties. It might not be 
reasonable to ask the same supervisor to review detail tapes from the company’s cash 
registers. It almost certainly would not be reasonable to ask the warehouse supervisor to let 
company investigators search his personal residence.  
 
The issue of whether an employee has a duty to cooperate often comes up when 
investigators seek to interview employees about suspected workplace misconduct. In general, 
interviews should be considered reasonable if the interview addresses matters within the 
scope of the employee’s actions or duties.
