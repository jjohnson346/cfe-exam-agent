Introduction 
There is a surprising amount of information about individuals that can be accessed without 
legal process (e.g., a subpoena). In fact, the government is bound by law to facilitate the 
public’s access to government information and to  encourage a diversity of sources to acquire 
and use this information. But despite the public’s broad right of access, there are numerous 
laws that limit access to certain types of information, and a number of risks to privacy are 
raised by the collection of information. Therefore, fraud examiners must be certain that 
information obtained is done so legally.
