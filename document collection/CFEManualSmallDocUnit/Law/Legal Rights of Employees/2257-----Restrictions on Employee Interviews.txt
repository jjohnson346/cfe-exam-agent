Restrictions on Employee Interviews 
In the context of an internal investigation, employees of private entities generally do not 
enjoy constitutional protections. However, they may possess contractual rights that must be 
respected during the course of an interview. For example, an employee covered by a 
collective-bargaining agreement may have the right to have a representative present during 
the interview.  
 
Thus, it is in the company’s best interest to review all aspects of the employer-employee 
relationship, including company policies, contractual relationships, and prevailing law before 
conducting the interview.
