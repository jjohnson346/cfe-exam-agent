INVESTIGATIVE CONSUMER REPORT 
The FCRA also covers “investigative consumer reports.” Under the FCRA, an investigative 
consumer report is a report containing information about an individual’s character, general 
reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living that is obtained through personal 
interviews with neighbors, friends, or associates. If such a report is made, then other notices 
and consents may need to be obtained from the individual. For example, a separate 
disclosure must be used to inform the employee that an investigative consumer report is 
being obtained. The form must also state what sort of information will be collected. 
 
In addition, the company must disclose to the individual the nature and scope of the 
investigation (if he requests). If any adverse action is to be taken against the person, he can 
ask to receive a copy of the report before such action is taken. Further, the report given to 
the individual must not be redacted, meaning that if the report contains names of the people 
providing the information and what they reported, such information could not be deleted 
from the report. The person must also be given an opportunity to dispute the findings in the 
report.
