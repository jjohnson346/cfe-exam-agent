Monitoring Employees’ E-Mail and Voicemail 
The ECPA regulates access to stored e-mail and voicemail; it prohibits the unauthorized 
access of electronic communications that are in storage.   
Law  Individual Rights During Examinations 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.429 
Although the SCA generally prohibits third parties from accessing stored communications, 
there are two key exceptions: the provider exception and the consent exception. The provider 
exception  exempts providers of electronic communications services from the restrictions of 
the SCA. In other words, if a message is stored on an e-mail or voice mail system that the 
company provides, then the employer can access those messages as it sees fit without 
violating the ECPA. Note, however, that this exception does not allow the employer to 
access messages stored with an outside provider such as Yahoo!, Google, or AOL.  
 
The consent exception permits access of stored messages if such access is authorized by the 
intended recipient of the communication. This means that employers will be free to access 
employee e-mail and voice mail (including messages stored with outside providers) as long as 
the employees have given their consent. This exception provides the safest haven for 
employers who want to monitor their employees’ stored messages. To make sure the 
consent exception will apply, companies should obtain express written consent from all 
employees for such monitoring as a condition of employment.  
 
In addition to the ECPA, employers must also be aware of employees’ constitutional and 
common law privacy rights in the contents of their e-mail. As was discussed above, it is a 
good idea for all employers to establish a written policy which notifies employees that their 
stored messages are the property of the employer, and that they are subject to monitoring by 
the employer at any time.  
 
Also, keep in mind that, as with other forms of searches and surveillance, the courts will not 
look kindly on overly broad monitoring of stored communications. Employers should only 
access their employees’ stored voice mail or e-mail when there is a legitimate business 
purpose for doing so, and the access should be no more intrusive than necessary to achieve 
the purpose.
