Legal Rights of Employees

Applicability 
If no state action is involved, a private employer can interview an employee without the 
presence of his attorney. However, the employee, an individual, always has the right to 
consult an attorney, but there is typically no legal obligation to consult the employee’s lawyer 
prior to the interview or allow the employee’s lawyer to sit in during an interview. 
 
Whether an employee will be permitted to be accompanied by a representative during an 
interview generally depends on the particular circumstances. If the employee is covered by a 
collective-bargaining agreement, for example, the terms of the agreement will generally 
control whether a representative can be present. In the absence of such circumstances, the 
Individual Rights During Examinations Law

general rule is that it is at the company’s discretion whether it will allow the employee to be 
represented during an interview.
