Invasion of Privacy 
Employees also have common law privacy interests that limit an employer’s right to search. 
These common law protections, which are similar in nature and scope to the Fourth 
Amendment protections discussed above, cover both public and private employees. As long 
as an employee does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in an area, the employer 
can search that area without violating an employee’s common law right to privacy.

While modern tort law includes four categories of invasion of privacy, this discussion only 
addresses two of those torts: publicity of private facts and intrusion upon seclusion.
