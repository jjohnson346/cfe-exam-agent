PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE FACTS 
The tort of public disclosure of private facts occurs when one party makes public statements 
about another party’s private life that are not of public concern. The disclosure of those facts 
must be highly offensive to a reasonable person. This tort can exist even if the statements 
are true. Because giving unreasonable publicity to true, but private, information about an 
employee can give rise to a claim for invasion of privacy, the need to communicate 
information about the employee must be balanced against the intrusion into the employee’s 
privacy.
