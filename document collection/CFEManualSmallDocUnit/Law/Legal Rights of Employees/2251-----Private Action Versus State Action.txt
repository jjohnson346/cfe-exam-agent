Private Action Versus State Action 
For an employee to sue an employer for the violation of a constitutional right, there must be 
some form of “state action” involved. State acti on is involved during any investigation by a 
state or federal entity, including investigations of their own employees. 
 
There are no bright-line rules regarding when an investigation can be considered to involve 
state action. The following examples, however, could be considered to involve state action: 
• Investigations conducted by a private company but at the suggestion of the state or 
federal authorities 
• Investigations begun by a private company that later are taken over or expanded by state 
or federal authorities 
• Joint investigations with or aided by state or federal authorities 
• Investigations conducted by a private company that are required by state or federal law 
• Searches or interrogations conducted by outside investigators who are off-duty state, 
local, or federal authorities
