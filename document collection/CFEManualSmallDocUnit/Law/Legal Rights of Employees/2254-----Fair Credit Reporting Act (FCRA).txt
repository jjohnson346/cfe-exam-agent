Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) 
One of the primary statutes limiting access to information is the federal Fair Credit 
Reporting Act (FCRA). This statute regulates the dissemination of consumer information to 
third parties by consumer reporting agencies. Historically, the FCRA only applied to 
consumer credit reports, but due to amendments in 1997, the FCRA applies to the gathering 
of many other types of information about an individual through third parties. 
 
The FCRA regulates the type of information that can be contained in a consumer credit 
report; it restricts credit bureaus from releasing an individual’s credit information to any 
third parties without authorization, and it sets forth the circumstances under which a third-
 party can obtain a copy of the report. 
 
If the FCRA does apply, it means that an examiner cannot obtain certain information about

a person unless that person has received certain notices and signed a consent form. The 
failure to do so can mean civil penalties. Also, if an examiner obtains a copy of a credit 
report, that fact will be noted on the report. 
 
Often, fraud examiners will need to obtain consumer reports for pre-employment purposes 
and workplace investigations of fraud an misconduct.
