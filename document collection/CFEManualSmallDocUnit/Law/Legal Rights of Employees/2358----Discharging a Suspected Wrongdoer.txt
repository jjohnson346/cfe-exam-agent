Discharging a Suspected Wrongdoer 
Many employers, when confronted with a possible wrongdoer or an employee who refuses 
to cooperate in the investigation, immediately want to fire the employee. Whether the 
employee can or should be discharged depends on the facts of the case and the law in the 
employer’s state. Public employers are governed by stricter standards than private employers. 
Constitutional and statutory laws govern the investigation and termination of public 
employees. For example, a public employee cannot be terminated for exercising his Fifth 
Amendment right against self-incrimination. 
 
Employers are generally permitted to discipline or terminate an employee who refuses to 
cooperate with a reasonable request to provide information. But if the employee has an 
employment contract for a specified term or is employed under a collective bargaining 
agreement that requires the employer to have good cause to terminate employment, then the 
question will be whether the refusal to cooperate amounted to good cause for the termination. 
This, in turn, depends on the nature and reasonableness of the request for information, the 
reasons for the refusal and the overall impact that the refusal has on the investigation. A 
good cause requirement can also arise if the company’s policies and practices create an 
implied employment contract. 
 
In contrast, employees who do not have an employment contract that imposes a good cause 
requirement — so-called at-will employees — can be discharged at any time and for any reason; 
that is, an employer does not need good cause to discharge an at-will employee. In some 
states, employment is considered at will in the absence of an employment contract.   
 
An employer, however, does not have a right to fire any employee — including an at-will 
employee — if the firing contravenes a fundamental public policy (for instance, firing an 
employee who refuses to commit an illegal act) or if it violates the company’s established or 
customary disciplinary practices and procedures. For more information, see the Discharge in 
Violation of Public Policy section below.
