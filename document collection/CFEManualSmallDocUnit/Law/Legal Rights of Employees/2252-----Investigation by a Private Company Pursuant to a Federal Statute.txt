Investigation by a Private Company Pursuant to a Federal Statute 
If an investigation is conducted by a private company in accordance with federal laws, an 
issue is raised as to whether the corporation’s internal investigation could be considered state 
action.  
 
For example, in the case of Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989), the 
U.S. Supreme Court found that a private railroad acted as an agent for the government when 
it complied with the provisions of the Federal Railroad Administration Act in administering

drug tests to its employees. Under the regulation at issue, the railroad was required by law to 
conduct the test and the Federal Railroad Administration was authorized to receive the test 
results. 
 
If a company is conducting an investigation pursuant to such federal laws as the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 or the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the company should be 
aware of the possible implications of state action. Therefore, before any adverse action is 
taken against an employee, legal advice should be obtained.
