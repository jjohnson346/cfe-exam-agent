UNION EMPLOYEES  
Since 1975 and the U.S. Supreme Court decision of NLRB v. Weingarten, 420 U.S. 251 (1975), 
union employees have had the right to union representation during an investigatory 
interview, provided that the employee “reasonably believes” the interview “might result in 
disciplinary action.” This right derived from the National Labor Relations Act, which 
provides that employees have the right “to act in concert for mutual aid and protection.” In 
the years since Weingarten, this right has only been applied in cases where the employee under 
investigation was covered by a collective-bargaining agreement.
