Defamation 
Defamation is an unprivileged publication of a falsehood about a person that tends to harm 
the reputation of that person. The law of defamation actually consists of two torts: libel and 
slander. Libel is basically defamation that appears in written form, while slander involves

defamatory remarks that are only spoken. 
 
In general, the elements of these two causes of action are essentially the same. To recover 
for defamation, the plaintiff must prove the following elements:  
• The defendant made an untrue statement of fact 
• The statement was communicated (published) to third parties 
• The statement was made on an unprivileged occasion 
• The statement damaged the subject’s reputation 
 
The threat of a defamation lawsuit is always present when allegations of wrongdoing are 
made against certain employees. For example, a claim of defamation might arise in the 
context of an interview as a result of unfounded accusations or statements made by the 
interviewer, where someone in addition to the employee and the interviewer is present. 
 
Assuming that an employee can establish that defamatory statements were made and 
communicated to a third-party, the most important defense to a defamation action for fraud 
examiners is that of qualified business privilege. If this privilege applies, then no liability can 
attach to the speaker.  
 
The qualified business privilege generally applies if a person makes a statement (1) in good 
faith; (2) regarding a subject in which the person making the statement has a legitimate 
interest or duty; and (3) to those who have an interest in the matter.  
 
The privilege, however, might be lost if the defamatory statements are communicated with 
“malice.” This usually means that the person communicating the statements knew they were 
false or made them without regard to whether they were false. 
 
Some courts have held that there can be no defamation arising from an employer’s inquiries 
of its employees concerning their possible involvement in a violation of company policy. 
The employer might even have duty to investigate, arising from its duty to protect its 
business, its employees, and the public from wrongdoing employees.
