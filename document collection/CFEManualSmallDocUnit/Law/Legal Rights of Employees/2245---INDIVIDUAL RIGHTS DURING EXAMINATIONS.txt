INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS DURING EXAMINATIONS 
 
Employees involved in investigations of suspected fraud have certain rights and obligations, 
whether the employee is merely a bystander to the fraud who may have some information 
relevant to the investigation or is the person actually suspected of committing the fraud. 
Many of these rights and obligations, however, are not perfectly clear, and they typically vary 
from case to case, generally depending on the employee’s contractual rights, applicable laws, 
and business policies. Therefore, fraud examiners conducting investigations into suspected 
misconduct must be flexible enough to adapt quickly to the unique situations they 
encounter.
