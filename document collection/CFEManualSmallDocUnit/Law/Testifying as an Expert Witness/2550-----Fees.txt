Testifying as an Expert Witness


:


Fees 
This method attacks the witness on the basis of taking an inordinate amount of time for the 
result given. The attack might indicate a lack of complete work and be correlated to the fee 
charged. This method often is related to “bias” and “myopic vision.” It might be suggested 
that the witness and his opinion are, in fact, biased. This technique often builds to a 
conclusion in which the opposing counsel arrives at the idea that the work was superficial and 
unprofessional, yet a great deal of money was received by the expert for this and other areas 
of service to the client. The inference is that the testimony was purchased or that the expert 
was paid to overlook facts contradictory to the conclusions reached.
