What to Include in an Expert Witness Report  
The requirements for an expert report differ depending on whether a case is pending in 
federal or state court. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2), which applies to civil cases in 
federal court, requires expert witnesses to prepare reports and provide them to the opposing 
parties, although this requirement may be waived if directed by the court or agreed to by the 
principle parties involved. The rule applies to experts who have been retained specifically for a 
given case, and it includes employees of a party if part of the employees’ duties involves giving 
expert testimony. A written report, often called a Rule 26 report, must be produced for each 
expert witness.  
 
Conversely, some state courts do not require written expert reports but may require another 
form of mandatory disclosures. Unfortunately, the requirements of all fifty states are beyond 
the scope of this manual. Therefore, experts should check with counsel prior to issuing their 
written report to make sure that the report will comply with any applicable standards or 
requirements under state law.
