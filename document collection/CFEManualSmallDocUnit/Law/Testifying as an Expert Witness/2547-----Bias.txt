Testifying as an Expert Witness


:


Bias 
This method draws the expert’s counsel and the expert together to show possible collusion as 
to the evidence being presented, and hence to demonstrate bias. This can be shown if the 
opposing counsel can determine that the expert’s  counsel had instructed the witness as to 
what to say or by limiting the expert’s scope and thus his conclusions. This approach also can 
focus on the question of whether or not the expert was told by his client what to do and look 
for. With this approach, opposing counsel might attempt to show that the expert overlooked 
important documentation in an effort to assist his client.
