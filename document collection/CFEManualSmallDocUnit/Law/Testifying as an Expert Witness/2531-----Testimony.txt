Testifying as an Expert Witness


:


Testimony 
After determining that a witness is a qualified expert, the trial judge must determine that the 
testimony offered by the expert is relevant to the facts of the case and reliable. These two 
questions focus on what opinions the expert will actually testify to in court.  
 
Relevant testimony will assist the jury in understanding the evidence or determining a fact at 
issue. To be relevant, the proposed testimony must be “sufficiently tied to the facts of the case 
that it will aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.” Specifically, the court must determine 
whether the expert’s opinion has any tenden cy to make the existence of any fact more 
probable than it would be without the evidence. Testimony is not relevant if the jury can make 
its own determination without expert testimony. 
 
To be reliable, the testimony must be based on sufficient facts and data, and it must be the 
product of reliable methodology that has been reliably applied  to the facts of the case. This 
assures that an expert’s opinions are not mere speculation.  
 
In Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Supreme Court set forth the following non-exclusive 
list of factors to assess reliability: 
• Whether the expert’s theory or technique can be or has been tested 
• Whether the expert’s theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and 
publication 
• Whether the expert’s theory or technique enjoys general acceptance within the relevant 
scientific community 
• Whether there are standards governing the method used by the expert 
• Whether the expert’s technique has a high error rate 
 
Accordingly, CFEs should be sure to fully cover the rationale for their assumptions and 
determine whether the assumptions are supported by the facts presented during discovery. In 
fact, courts often find that assumptions not supported by evidence render expert opinions 
insufficient, thus causing the judge to exclude the expert’s testimony. For example, in Target 
Market Publishing, Inc. v. ADVO, Inc., a breach of contract case arising from a joint venture to 
produce advertising publications, a well-qualified accountant and business appraiser concluded

that, had the defendant performed its contractual obligations, the joint venture would have 
earned $1.4 million in profits. To reach this conclusion, the expert assumed the joint venture 
would have successfully entered 49 marketing zones at the time of the breach. But the joint 
venture had only entered into two marketing zones and was unprofitable in both. The 
appellate court affirmed the exclusion of the expert’s opinion as to the value of a contract 
because the methodology underlying the opinion was based upon subjective belief and 
speculation, including unsupported assumptions.  
 
When preparing an expert report or testimony, examiners should keep in mind the Daubert 
factors set forth above. Examiners should document their conclusions, how they reached 
those conclusions, what evidence they based the conclusions on, and what professional 
techniques or knowledge they used. It would also be a good idea to keep a list of professional 
books or journals that advocate or sanction whatever principles were used in drawing the 
conclusions.
