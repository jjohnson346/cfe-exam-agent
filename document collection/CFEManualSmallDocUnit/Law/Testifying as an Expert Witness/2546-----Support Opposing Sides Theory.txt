Testifying as an Expert Witness


:


Support Opposing Side’s Theory 
This approach recognizes an expert’s qualifications and evidence. The same information used 
by the expert is then interpreted by opposing counsel in a different fashion to support an 
alternate theory. By getting the expert to agree to the alternate interpretation of the facts and 
the alternate theory, the opposing counsel, in effect, has made the expert a witness for the 
other side. This technique is useful to obtain concessions from the witness that would damage 
his conclusions and, ultimately, his credibility.
