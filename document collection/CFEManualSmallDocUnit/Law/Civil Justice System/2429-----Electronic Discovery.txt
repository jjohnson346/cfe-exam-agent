Electronic Discovery 
Electronic discovery (e-discovery) refers to the legal discovery process that deals with 
electronically stored information (ESI). ESI is different from paper information because it 
can be stored in larger volumes and in more locations. It is also more volatile. In addition, 
electronic documents usually contain metadata (data about data), which is rarely found in 
paper documents.  
 
Because of ESI’s uniqueness, e-discovery poses additional challenges to the legal process.
