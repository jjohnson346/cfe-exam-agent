SAFE HARBOR 
FRCP 37 allows courts to order sanctions for a party’s failure to make disclosures or to 
cooperate in discovery, but, as amended, Rule 37 contains a “safe harbor” provision, 
providing that courts cannot impose sanctions on a company for failing to provide ESI that 
was lost because of routine data management practices. Nevertheless, it is important to note 
Law  The Civil Justice System 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.609 
that ignorance is no defense against how a party’s electronic information is stored.
