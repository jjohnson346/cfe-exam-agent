Requests for Inspection of Property 
Parties may request to inspect equipment, real estate, or other property which has a bearing 
on the proceedings. Requests for inspection set forth as specifically as possible the items of 
the request and the type of examination desired. In fraud cases, this request may pertain to 
records, archives, office machines, or land that has been involved in a crime. For example, in 
the Johnnie McKenzie case, which can be found in the Appendix A, McKenzie was accused 
of taking money out of a safe; therefore, a crucial issue in the case involved who had access 
to the safe and whether the combination of the safe had been changed. The defense filed a 
motion requesting that they be allowed to enter the premises of the West Palm Beach Police 
Department to examine and conduct a test of the safe. (A copy of that motion is included in 
Appendix A.) Requests for inspection of property are covered under Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 34.
