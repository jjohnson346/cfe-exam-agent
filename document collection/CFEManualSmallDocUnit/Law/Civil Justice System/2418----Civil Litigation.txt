Civil Litigation 
Civil actions to recover damages for fraud or to enjoin further fraudulent activity can be filed 
by private plaintiffs in state or federal courts. Most common-law fraud actions, usually styled 
misrepresentation claims, are filed in state courts. Suits involving parties from different states 
and involving more than $75,000 in controversy (known as diversity cases), or actions brought 
on the basis of federal statutes, such as the civil RICO provisions, can be brought in federal 
court. Federal court generally is preferred by plaintiffs in larger cases because federal courts 
provide better access to witnesses and documents located in different states. The procedures 
described below are largely drawn from the federal rules.
