Motion for Summary Judgment 
A motion for summary judgment asks a judge to decide the case, without a trial, based on 
the evidence contained in the complaint and answer. Judges may also consider affidavits or 
declarations (i.e., sworn written statements), contracts, or other materials in reaching their 
summary decision. Either side in a lawsuit can file for summary judgment. The motion is 
granted unless it can be shown that some of the facts as presented are in dispute.
