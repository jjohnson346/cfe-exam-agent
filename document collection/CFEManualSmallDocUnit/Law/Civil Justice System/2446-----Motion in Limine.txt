Motion in Limine 
This motion is made before trial, and it requests the court to rule that evidence is 
inadmissible, prohibiting opposing counsel from referring to or offering the evidence during 
trial. For example, Rock-Hard may use something damaging from Bartleby’s criminal trial in 
their complaint. Bartleby objects to the complaint because it unfairly prejudices the case 
against him.
