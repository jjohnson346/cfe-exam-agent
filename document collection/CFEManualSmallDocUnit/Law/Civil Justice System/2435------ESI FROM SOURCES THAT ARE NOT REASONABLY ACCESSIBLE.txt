ESI FROM SOURCES THAT ARE NOT REASONABLY ACCESSIBLE 
FRCP 26 also makes a distinction between ESI that is reasonably accessible and that which 
is not. The relevant provision states that a party need not provide discovery of ESI “from 
sources that the party identifies as ‘not reasonably accessible’ because of undue burden or 
cost.”  
 
The rule, however, does not define what is reasonably accessible. Accordingly, disputes will 
continue to center on how “accessible” the information is and what constitutes “undue 
burden or cost.” Thus, at the outset of fores eeable litigation, parties should understand the 
scope and sources of their electronic information that may be related to the case, as well as 
the information’s location and format. Thereafter, it will be the court’s responsibility to 
reconcile disagreements between the parties as to what electronic information is and is not 
reasonably accessible.
