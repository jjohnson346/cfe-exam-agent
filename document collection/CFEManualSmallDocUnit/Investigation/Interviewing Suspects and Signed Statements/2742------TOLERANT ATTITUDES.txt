TOLERANT ATTITUDES 
Dishonest people typically have tolerant attitudes toward miscreant conduct. The interviewer 
in an internal theft case might ask, “What should happen to this person when he is caught?” The 
honest person will usually say, “They should be fired/prosecuted.” The dishonest individual is 
much more likely to reply, “How should I know?” or, “Maybe he is a good employee who got into 
problems. Perhaps he should be given a second chance.”
