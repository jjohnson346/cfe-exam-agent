REVENGE 
Similar to other themes, revenge can be effectively developed as a motive. In this technique, 
the interviewer attempts to blame the offense on the accused’s feeling that he must “get 
back” at someone or something.

EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, what has happened is out of character for you. I think you were trying to get back at 
your supervisor for the time he passed you over for a raise. I would probably feel the same. 
That’s what happened, isn’t it, Linda?” 
OR 
“E. J., everyone around here knows that the board has not supported you in your efforts to turn 
this company around. I would understand if you said to yourself, ‘I’ll show them.’ Is that what 
happened, E. J.?”
