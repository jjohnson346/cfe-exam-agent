Chronological Confusion 
Chronological confusion is commonly encountered in interviews seeking case history 
information. This term refers to the respondent’s tendency to confuse the order of 
experiences and can occur in two ways: two or more events might be correctly recalled, but 
the respondent is unsure of the sequence, or only one event might be recalled, and it is 
incorrectly assumed to have been true at an earlier point.
