Don’t React 
Sometimes a respondent will insist on giving the interviewer a “hard time” for no apparent 
reason, though, in reality, there can be a multitude of reasons why the person refuses to 
cooperate. There are three natural reactions for the interviewer verbally assailed by the 
respondent: to strike back, to give in, or to terminate the interview. None of these tactics is 
satisfactory, as none leads to a productive interview. Instead, the interviewer should 
consciously ensure that he does not react to anger with hostility.
