Frazier v. Cupp  
In Frazier v. Cupp, 394 U.S. 731 (1961), the U.S. Supreme Court indirectly recognized the 
necessity of using deception during interviews. In this case, the suspect confessed to a 
homicide after the interrogator falsely told him that his alleged accomplice had confessed to 
the crime. On appeal, the Supreme Court ruled that the deception alone was insufficient to 
invalidate the confession.
