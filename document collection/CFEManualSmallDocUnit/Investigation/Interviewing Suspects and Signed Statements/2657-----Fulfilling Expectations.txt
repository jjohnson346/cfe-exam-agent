Fulfilling Expectations 
One of the important forces in social interaction is the tendency of one person to 
communicate, verbally or nonverbally, his expectations to the other person. The second 
person then tends to respond, consciously or unconsciously, to those expectations. This 
might be viewed as one manifestation of the more general human tendency to conform to 
the group and to the anticipations of higher-status people. It is in this conformity to group 
norms that security is sought. 
 
In the interview setting, the interviewer communicates expectations to the respondent. The 
interviewer should be able to transmit both a general expectation of cooperation and a more 
specific expectation that the respondent will answer the questions truthfully. The interviewer 
must clearly distinguish between asking for information and expecting it. The former is 
mainly achieved with verbal communication, while the latter is accomplished through 
nonverbal behavior. The interviewer who expects the respondent to cooperate will likely be 
more successful than one who only asks questions.
