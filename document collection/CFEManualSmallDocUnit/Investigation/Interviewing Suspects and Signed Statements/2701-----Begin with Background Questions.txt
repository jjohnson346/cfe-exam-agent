Interviewing Suspects and Signed Statements

Begin with Background Questions 
Assuming the respondent does not have a problem answering the transitional question, the 
interviewer should then ask a series of easy, open questions designed to get the respondent 
to talk about himself. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“What is your exact title?” 
 
“What do your responsibilities involve?” 
 
“How long have you been assigned here?” 
 
“What do you like best about your job?” 
 
“What do you like least about your job?” 
 
“What would you eventually like to do for the company?” 
 
“Overall, how do you like your current job?”
