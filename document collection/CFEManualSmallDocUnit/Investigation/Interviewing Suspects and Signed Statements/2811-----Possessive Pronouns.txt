Possessive Pronouns 
When an interviewee is giving bogus testimony concerning an event, he will often drop the 
possessive pronoun to shift the blame to an exterior force.

EXAMPLE 
“I got on my register at 10:30. I was working at my register when I was called away by my 
supervisor. When I returned to the register, the register was open and the cash was gone.” 
 
In this statement, the subject referred to the register as “my register” up until the 
controversial act took place. At that point, “my register” becomes “the register,” indicating 
that the subject no longer wants to be associated with a corrupted register. This pronoun 
switch indicates that the subject is being less than truthful.
