ACCUSER’S ACTIONS 
Don’t disclose the accuser’s identity if it is not already known. But in cases where the 
accuser’s identity is known to the accused, it can be helpful to blame the accuser for the 
problem. The accuser can be a colleague, manager, auditor, fraud examiner, or any similar 
person. Alternatively, the problem can be blamed on the company. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, you know what these auditors are like. They are hired to turn over every stone. I 
wonder how they would look if we put them under  a microscope. Compared to other things that 
are going on, what you’ve done isn’t that bad. Right, Linda?” 
OR 
“ E. J., I really blame a large part of this on the company. If some of the things that went on 
around this company were known, it would make what you’ve done seem pretty small in 
comparison, wouldn’t it, E. J.?”
