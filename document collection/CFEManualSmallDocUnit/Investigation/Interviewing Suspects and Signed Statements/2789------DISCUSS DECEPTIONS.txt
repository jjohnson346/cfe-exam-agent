DISCUSS DECEPTIONS 
The final technique is to discuss the accused’s de ceptions. The purpose is to appeal to the 
accused’s logic, not to scold or degrade. This technique is sometimes the only one available 
if physical evidence is lacking. As with other interview situations, the word lying  should  
be avoided.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Respondent : 
“There is no way I could have done this. I didn’t have the opportunity.”

Interviewer: 
“Linda, here is the situation: you know what you’ ve done, and so do I. I can understand it is 
difficult for you to admit. But if all the facts have  to be presented, everyone will reach the same 
inescapable conclusion: you are responsible. If you continue to deny  what you’ve done, you’ll just 
make the situation worse. You understand that, don’t you?”
