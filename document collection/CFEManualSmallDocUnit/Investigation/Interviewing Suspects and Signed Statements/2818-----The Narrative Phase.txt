The Narrative Phase 
The first portion of the cognitive interview is the narrative phase, in which the witness tells 
the “whole story.” The investigator should first allow the witness to recount the situation, 
using several steps to guide the narrative portion. There are four primary steps in the 
narrative phase of the cognitive interview: 
• Reconstruct the circumstances of the event. 
• Instruct the eyewitness to report everything and be complete. 
• Recall the events in different orders. 
• Change perspectives.
