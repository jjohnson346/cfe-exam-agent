Closed Questions 
Closed questions are those that require a precise answer: usually “yes” or “no.” Closed 
questions also deal with specifics, such as amounts, dates, and times. As far as possible, 
closed questions should be avoided in the informational part of the interview. They are used 
extensively in closing questions. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer : 
“Do you work here?” 
 
“What day of the week did it happen?”
