Interviewing Suspects and Signed Statements


:


Present an Alternative Question  
After the accused’s alibis have been diffused, he normally will become quiet and withdrawn. 
Some people in this situation might cry. If so, be comforting. Do not discourage the accused 
from showing emotion. In this stage, the accused is deciding whether to confess. The 
interviewer at this point should present an alternative question to the accused. The 
alternative question forces the accused to make one of two choices. One alternative allows 
the accused a morally acceptable reason for the misdeed; the other paints the accused in a 
negative light. Regardless of which answer the accused chooses, he is acknowledging guilt.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, did you plan this deliberately, or did it just happen?” 
OR 
“Linda, did you just want extra money, or did you do this because you had financial 
problems?” 
OR 
“Linda, did you just get greedy, or did you do this because of the way the company has treated 
you?”
