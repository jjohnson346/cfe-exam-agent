Kinesic Interview and Interrogation 
The kinesic interview or interrogation is a method that has become more popular among the 
law enforcement community in recent years. This type of interview is different than 
traditional interview methods because the interviewer is not necessarily looking for a 
confession from the interview subject. Instead of searching for information from the 
subject, the interviewer is attempting to assess whether the subject is telling the truth by 
reading his body language and other physical manifestations of deception. 
 
In the book The Kinesic Interview Technique, authors Frederick C. Link and D. Glen Foster 
define the kinesic interview technique as: 
 
“[An interview technique] used for gaining information from an individual who is not willingly or 
intentionally disclosing it.” 
 
Link and Foster believe that the kinesic inter view technique is based entirely on the concept 
of stress — an event or circumstance that forces an individual’s mind or body out of 
psychological equilibrium. When stress occurs, humans, like any other living creature, have 
an emotional reaction. Link and Foster refer to this as the “fight or flight syndrome,” in 
which we either run from a stressful situation or brace to face it. Either way, they 
hypothesize, our animalistic tendencies dictate that we must react to stress. When this 
concept is applied to the interview situation, the kinesic interview technique is applied to 
attempt to read the interview subject’s reaction to stress.  
 
This method relies, in a broad sense, on the interviewer’s ability to observe the interview 
subject for signs or symptoms of deceit. The kinesic interview is conducted not just to 
observe what the subject says, but also how the subject says it; the subject’s gestures, 
posturing, facial expressions, and voice inflection are just a few of the traits that an 
investigator looks at. This style of interviewing assumes that when most human beings lie or 
are deceitful to others, they will reveal this deceit through their body language. 
 
These reactions are generally subconscious; in most cases, the interviewee does not even 
realize that he is acting noticeably different. The actions or signs that an interviewer is 
looking for are called meaningful behavior — activities that may suggest that an interviewee is 
under stress.

Link and Foster identify three distinct categories into which meaningful behavior can  
be divided: 
• Self-initiated verbal statements that the interviewee initiates without prompting 
• Prompted verbal responses or statements made by the interviewee in response to 
structured questions asked by the interviewer 
• Nonverbal behavior or body language, which includes body positioning movements, lack 
of movement, and observable physiological changes
