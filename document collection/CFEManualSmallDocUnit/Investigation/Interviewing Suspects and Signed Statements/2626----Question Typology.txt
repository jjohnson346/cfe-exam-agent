Question Typology 
When conducting an interview, there are five general types of questions an interviewer can 
ask: introductory, informational, assessment, closing, and admission-seeking.  
 
Because fraud examinations move in a linear order, starting with the general and working to 
the specific, the first interviews should be with those that are least likely to be involved, 
working towards those that are more likely to be involved. The first interviews are 
conducted for the purpose of gathering information, and therefore they should be non-confrontational, 
non-threatening, and should encourage open communication. In these 
routine interview situations, only three of the five types of questions will normally be asked:

introductory, informational, and closing questions. If the interviewer has reasonable cause to 
believe the respondent is not being truthful, assessment questions can be asked. Finally, if 
the interviewer decides with reasonable cause that the respondent is responsible for 
misdeeds, admission-seeking questions can be posed.
