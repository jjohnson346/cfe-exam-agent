Volatile Interviews 
A volatile interview  is one that has the potential to bring about strong emotional reactions in 
the respondent. Typical volatile interviews involve close friends and relatives of a miscreant, 
co-conspirators, and similar individuals. 
 
The personality characteristics of those involved in the volatile interview vary. The types 
listed represent the most common personality characteristics associated with volatile 
interviews. Some individuals, by nature, are resentful of authority figures, such as fraud 
examiners and law enforcement officers. 
 
Friends, relatives, and romantic interests of a target often make for a difficult interview. They 
perceive that the examiner is “out to get” someone close to them.
