GENUINE NEED 
In a very small number of cases, fraud is predicated by genuine need. For example, the 
accused might be paying for the medical care of sick parents or a child. Or some other 
financial disaster might have befallen the miscreant. In those cases, the following techniques 
might be effective. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I don’t know many people who have had so many bad things happen all at once. I can 
see where you thought this was pretty much a matter of life or death, right, Linda?” 
OR 
“E. J., you’re like everyone else: you have to put food on the table. But in your position, it is 
very difficult to ask for help. You genuinely needed  to do this to survive, didn’t you, E. J.?”
