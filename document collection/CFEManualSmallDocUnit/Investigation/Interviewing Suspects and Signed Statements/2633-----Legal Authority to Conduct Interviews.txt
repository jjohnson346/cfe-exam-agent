Legal Authority to Conduct Interviews 
In most instances, legal authority is not required to interview people or to inquire into 
matters. The federal constitution gives any citizen the authority to inquire into virtually any 
subject area, as long as the rights of individuals are not transgressed in the process. 
Generally, no license is required to conduct interviews; however, if the interviewer 
represents himself as an investigator, some states require a license.
