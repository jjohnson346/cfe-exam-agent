FLEEING POSITIONS 
During the interview, dishonest people will often posture themselves in a “fleeing position.” 
While the head and trunk might be facing the interviewer, the feet and lower portion of the 
body might be pointing toward the door in an unconscious effort to flee from the 
interviewer.
