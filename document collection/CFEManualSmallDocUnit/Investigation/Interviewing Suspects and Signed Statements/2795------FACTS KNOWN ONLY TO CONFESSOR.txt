FACTS KNOWN ONLY TO CONFESSOR 
Once the intent question is solved, the questi oning turns to those facts known only to the 
confessor. These facts include—at a minimum— the accused’s estimates  of the number of 
instances of wrongful conduct as well as the total amount of money involved. The questions 
should not be phrased so that the confessor can answer “yes” or “no.” 
 
ESTIMATE OF NUMBER OF INSTANCES/AMOUNTS 
In fraud matters especially, it is common for the accused to underestimate the amount of 
funds involved as well as the number of instances. This is probably because of a natural 
tendency of the human mind to block out unpleasant matters. Take the figures with a grain 
of salt. If the accused’s response is “I don’t know,” start high with the amounts and 
gradually come down. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, how many times do you think this happened?” 
 
Respondent : 
“I don’t have any idea.” 
 
Interviewer:  
“Was it as many as 100 times?”

Respondent : 
“No way!” 
 
Interviewer: 
“How about 75 times?” 
 
Respondent : 
“That’s still too high. Probably not more than two or three times.” 
 
Interviewer: 
“Are you pretty sure, Linda?” (If the accused’s estimates are too low, gently get her 
to acknowledge a higher figure. But do not challenge the accused by calling her a 
liar.) 
 
Respondent : 
“Maybe three times, but certainly not more than that.”
