Reinforce Rationalization 
Once the benchmark admission is made, the interviewer should reinforce the confessor’s 
decision. Then the interviewer should make the transition into the verbal confession, where 
the details of the offense are obtained. Reinforcing the rationalization developed earlier will 
help the confessor feel comfortable, believing that the interviewer does not look down  
on him.

EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I am glad to hear that you had a good  reason to do this. That reinforces what I 
thought all along — that you were caught up in extraordinary circumstances. When was the first 
time you did it?”
