Interview Room 
When preparing a room for an admission-seeking interview, it is important that the 
interviewer consider the privacy afforded by the room. The location should establish a sense 
of privacy. The door should be closed but not locked, there should be no physical barriers 
preventing the target from leaving, and the suspect should be made aware that he is free to 
leave. This is to avoid allegations of “custodial interrogation.”

Distractions should be kept to a minimum. Ideally, there should be no photographs, 
windows, or other objects in the room. Chairs should be placed about four to six feet apart, 
and the accused should not be permitted to sit behind any physical barriers, such as chairs, 
tables, or desks. This is to prohibit a psychological barrier for the accused to “hide behind.”
