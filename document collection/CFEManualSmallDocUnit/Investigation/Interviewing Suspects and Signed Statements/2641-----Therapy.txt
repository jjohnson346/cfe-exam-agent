Therapy 
Making people feel good about themselves is often a function of conversation. In an 
ordinary conversation with a friend, a person often expresses ideas and feelings to remove 
emotional tension. This release is called catharsis, and is encouraged, for example, in 
psychiatric interviews. There are many times when the information sought in an interview is 
closely related to the respondent’s inner conflicts and tensions. For example, in the area of 
fraud, a person embezzling money from the company will typically feel guilty. A skillful 
interviewer will know the therapeutic implication of such a feeling when attempting to 
develop information.
