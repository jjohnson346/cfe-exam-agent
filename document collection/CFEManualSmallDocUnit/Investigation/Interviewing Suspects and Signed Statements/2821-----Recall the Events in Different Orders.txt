Recall the Events in Different Orders 
Constructing the event in a different order will give the witness the freedom to completely 
recreate the event. When recounting the event in sequential order, the witness may very well 
forget minute details in an effort to describe what happened next. If the witness constructs 
the event from the single moment or thing that left the greatest impression on him, the 
interviewer may gain a foothold on the witness’s perspective.
