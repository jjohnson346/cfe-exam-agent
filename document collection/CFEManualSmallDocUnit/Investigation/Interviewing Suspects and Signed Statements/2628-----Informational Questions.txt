Informational Questions 
Once the proper format for the interview is set, the interviewer then turns to the fact-gathering 
portion. Typically, the interviewer will ask three types of questions during this 
stage: open, closed, and leading. These question types are discussed in more detail below. 
Each type is used in a logical sequence to maximize the development of information. If the 
interviewer has reason to believe that the respondent is being untruthful, then assessment 
questions can be posed. Otherwise, the interview is brought to a logical close.
