REPEAT INTERRUPTIONS 
Occasionally, it might be necessary to interrupt  the accused’s attempted denial repeatedly. 
Because this stage is crucial, the interviewer should be prepared to increase the tone of the 
interruptions to the point when he is prepared to say: “Linda, if you keep interrupting, I am going 
to have to terminate this conversation.” The guilty individual will find this threatening, because she 
wants to know the extent of incriminating evidence in the interviewer’s possession.
