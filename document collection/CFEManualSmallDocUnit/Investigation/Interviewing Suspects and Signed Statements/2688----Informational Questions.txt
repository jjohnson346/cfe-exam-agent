Informational Questions 
Informational questions are nonconfrontational, nonthreatening, and are asked for 
information-gathering purposes. The great majority of the interviewer’s questions fall into 
this category. These types of questions may be asked during any of the following types of 
interviews: 
• Interviews to gain an understanding of accounting control systems 
• Interviews concerning documents 
• Interviews to gather information regarding business operations or systems 
• Pre-employment interviews 
  
Informational questions seek to elicit unbiased factual information. The interviewer will be 
alert to inconsistency in facts or behavior.
