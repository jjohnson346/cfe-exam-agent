Diffuse Alibis 
Even if the accused is presented with an appropriate rationalization, it is likely that he will 
continue to want to deny culpability. When the interviewer is successful in stopping denials, 
the accused normally will then turn to various reasons why he could not have committed the 
act in question. The purpose of this stage is to convince the accused of the weight of the 
evidence against him. Miscreants usually have a keen interest in material that tends to 
implicate them. Alibis generally can be diffused using one of the methods listed below.
