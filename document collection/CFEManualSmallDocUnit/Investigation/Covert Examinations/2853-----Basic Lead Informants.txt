Basic Lead Informants 
This type of informant supplies information to the police about illicit activities that they have 
encountered. The reasons that the informant decides to supply information are varied; some 
informants simply want to “do their part” to stop an unscrupulous activity, while others are 
interested in harming the criminals against whom they are informing. For instance, many 
informants in the drug, prostitution, or illegal gambling areas are involved in those areas as 
well and intend to eliminate some of their competition. Whatever the reason, these 
informants’ only role in a covert investigation is to supply law enforcement with 
information.
