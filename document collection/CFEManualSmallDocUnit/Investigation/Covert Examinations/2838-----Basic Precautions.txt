Basic Precautions 
An observer should refrain from making abrupt, unnatural moves that could attract 
attention. Disguises such as false beards are impractical, hard to maintain, and easily 
detectable. The observer should not look directly into the subject’s eyes. Inexperienced 
observers must overcome the tendency to believe that they have been “made” (identified) 
because the subject glances at them several times. The geography of the area where 
surveillance is to take place should be studied carefully. The observer should know the 
location of culs-de-sac or dead-end streets or alleys to avoid being trapped or discovered. A 
suspicious subject might suddenly reverse course, enter a dead-end street, board and 
suddenly depart from public transportation, or engage in a variety of other evasive actions. 
The observer can counter these strategies by following approved surveillance techniques.
