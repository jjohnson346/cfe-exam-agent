Fixed Surveillance 
A fixed surveillance, or stakeout, is used when the subject remains stationary. The observer 
can move around for closer observation. When one observer is detailed to watch a place 
with more than one exit, he might have to move about considerably. When preparing for a 
stakeout, the base of operations should be well planned. It might be a store, apartment, 
house, automobile, or truck. A thorough — but cautious—area reconnaissance should be 
conducted. Necessary equipment should be readily available, such as binoculars, electronic 
investigative aids, cameras, and sound recording devices.
