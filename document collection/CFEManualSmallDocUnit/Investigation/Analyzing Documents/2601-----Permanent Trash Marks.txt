Permanent “Trash Marks”  
These uniquely identifiable markings on copies are usually caused by accidental deep 
scratches and imperfections in the copier’s glass surface or document cover, in the printing 
element surface, or other permanent machine parts that are not readily replaced or changed 
during servicing of the machine. These marks can be reproduced on copies for years until 
the machine is repaired or the part replaced.
