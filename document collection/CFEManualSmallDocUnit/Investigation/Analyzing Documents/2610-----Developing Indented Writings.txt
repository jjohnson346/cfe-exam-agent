Developing Indented Writings 
Never attempt to develop indented writings by shading or scratching on the surface of a 
sheet of paper with a pencil. This will reveal deep indentations, but it will not reveal the faint 
ones and will permanently prevent expert examinations from developing them. Other types 
of technical examinations might also be prevented by this defacing of the document. 
 
Some indented writings can be visualized by taking the document to an area with subdued 
overhead lighting, placing the document on a flat surface, and shining a bright beam of light 
from a small-beam flashlight or small high-intensity lamp across the paper surface at a low 
oblique angle or parallel to the surface. Since shadows in the indentations will only show at 
right angles to the beam of light, it will be necessary to move the light around in several 
positions and note the changing shadows as they form the text of the indentations. 
 
Document experts use special lighting and photographic techniques and sensitive 
instruments such as the electrostatic detection apparatus (ESDA) to detect and permanently 
record extremely faint indented writings that cannot be visualized by the oblique-lighting 
method.
