Typewriter Ribbons Could Be Evidence 
Old-style fabric typewriter ribbons are rarely of any value in determining whether a particular 
typewriter was used to prepare a questioned document. Fortunately for investigators, most 
modern manual and electric typewriters, regardless of whether typebar or single element, are 
equipped with single-use ribbons. If it is suspected that an evidence document was recently 
prepared on such a machine, removal and examination of the ribbon might reveal the text of 
the document. Expert examination of the ribbon might positively prove that the typewriter 
and ribbon were used to produce the document.
