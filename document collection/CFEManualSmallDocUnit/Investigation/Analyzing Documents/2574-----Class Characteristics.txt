Class Characteristics 
Fraud examiners should not be misled in developing suspects by mistaking similar class 
characteristics in different writing samples. Samples that seem to look alike are not necessarily 
from the same individual. The writings of some people might share superficial similarities in 
appearance and style and look the same to the layman when, in fact, they are very different. 
Forensic document examiners can correct this mistake.
