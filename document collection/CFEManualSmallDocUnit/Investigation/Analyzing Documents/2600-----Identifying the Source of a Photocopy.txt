Identifying the Source of a Photocopy 
Photocopies can be the actual original evidence in the case of: 
• Anonymous letters 
• Unauthorized “leaks” of information in the fo rm of copies of letters, memoranda, files, 
and other records 
• Copies made to conceal forgeries or to insert or manipulate text 
• Spurious “disinformation” dissemination of phony official documents 
 
Locating the source of a copy can be crucial in some investigations. It is sometimes possible 
to determine what kind of copier was used to produce the copy in question. Some types of 
machines leave minute markings, indentations, and other features on the copy that will assist 
the expert in determining the brand and model of the machine used. It is also possible to 
identify the particular machine used by examining the pattern of unique and identifiable 
“trash marks” (specks, spots, streaks, edge markings, etc.) it leaves on copies and comparing 
them with copies from a known machine. The fraud examiner should be aware, however, 
that some of these markings have permanence while others are transient and temporary.
