Detecting Counterfeits 
Many counterfeits can be detected by making a side-by-side comparison with a 
corresponding genuine document. Be alert for different versions or form revisions. Look for 
subtle differences in ink colors and brilliance, different types of paper substrate, the use of 
different typestyles and type sizes (fonts), and evidence of the retouching the text on the 
genuine document used in the reproduction. The retouching will be most evident in areas 
where text, serial numbers, and the like are superimposed on a background design, especially 
if they are printed in black ink. 
 
When furnished with genuine documents for comparisons with suspected counterfeits, 
forensic document examiners can also make expert differentiations between the printing 
processes, ink formulations, and paper substrates used. In some instances it has been 
possible for the experts to reconstruct portions of the filled-in text or serial numbers that 
appeared on the genuine document, but were removed in the retouching process. In this 
fashion the specific original document used by the counterfeiter can sometimes be

determined. By tracing the history of the document’s ownership, the counterfeiter can be 
located and identified. Treatment of the original genuine document for latent  
fingerprints might positively identify the counterfeiter and other people who handled the 
genuine document.
