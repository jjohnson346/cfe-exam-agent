Charred or Partially Burned Documents 
These documents might contain valuable evidence if restored by experts, but they are very 
fragile and should be handled with extreme care. For proper preservation and storage, 
trained experts might use special polyester film sheets and envelopes, which are not readily 
available to the fraud examiner. The examiner can best preserve such evidence for 
submission to the forensic expert by using a sturdy crush-proof container into which he 
places layers of cotton (available in rolls at fabric and sewing materials shops). Carefully slide 
a sheet of paper or thin cardboard under the burned fragments, lift them and place them on 
the layers of cotton, then remove the paper used for lifting. Gently place additional layers of 
cotton over the fragments until the container is filled. Do not compress the cotton. Seal the 
container, initial and date it, add an identifying contents label or exhibit number, and clearly 
write or stamp “Fragile” on the container.
