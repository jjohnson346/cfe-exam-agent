Handling Documents as Physical Evidence 
A document can be a piece of physical evidence and not just a source of information. As a 
piece of evidence it should be handled carefully and stored properly in a sealed, initialed, and 
dated paper folder or envelope to avoid damage or contamination. If necessary, make a 
working copy and preserve the original document for submission to a forensic document 
examiner. Most forensic examinations will require the original document, not a copy of it,

since most photocopies do not reproduce original writings, typewriting, or other features 
with sufficient clarity or detail to allow adequate examination. 
 
When initialing a document for future identification, do it in a non-critical area and use a 
different type of writing instrument than was used for the questioned writings on the 
document. The examiner should never write or make markings on the original document 
other than his unobtrusive initials for identification. Do not add new folds, staple it, place 
paper clips on it, crumple it, or do anything else that would affect or change its original 
condition. If stored in an envelope, be careful not to write on the envelope and cause 
indentations on the original document inside. Photocopies and laser-printed documents 
should always be stored in paper folders or envelopes, not transparent plastic envelopes, 
which can result in the copies sticking to the plastic and destroying some features of the 
document.
