The “Long Lost” Will 
The sudden appearance of a new will that post-dates and supersedes all other wills is all too 
common. Amazingly, it often leaves large portions of the estate to the person who found it, 
and only a photocopy can be located. Many prove to have been fabricated using the cut-and-paste 
method. Although not involving photocopies, the much publicized fabricated and 
forged “Mormon Will” of Howard Hughes in the mid-1970s is a prime example.
