To-Do Lists 
Another indispensable aid is the to-do list. The list, which must be updated frequently, 
should be kept in a stenographer’s pad or other permanent ring binder to allow a cumulative 
record. In a very complex case, the list can be broken into long- and short-term objectives: 
that which must be done eventually (e.g., prove elements of a particular count), and that 
which should be done tomorrow (e.g., conduct an interview or draft a subpoena). However 
organized, some sort of list must be kept, otherwise important points will be forgotten in the 
lengthy case. A sample checklist is included in the “Report Writing” chapter.
