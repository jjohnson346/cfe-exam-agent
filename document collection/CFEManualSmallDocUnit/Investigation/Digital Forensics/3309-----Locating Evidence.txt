Locating Evidence 
To conduct a successful examination, examiners must know what to look for and where to 
look for it, but this can be difficult because digital data can be stored large volumes and in a 
number of different locations.  
 
The efficiency of computer technology has allowed users to create more voluminous pieces 
of data than was once possible. Computer hard drives are packed with digital data, and data 
storage now exceeds gigabytes. Therefore, it is necessary to reference larger storage 
capacities. Here is a chart that will help:

Furthermore, digital evidence may be located in a number of different locations. In addition 
to being stored on computers, evidence will be located in any form of technology that can be 
used to transmit or store data. Therefore, it is also important to investigate any suspect 
workstation, including any peripherals or other portable media devices that can be used to 
transmit or store data, and the information stored on the company’s network.
