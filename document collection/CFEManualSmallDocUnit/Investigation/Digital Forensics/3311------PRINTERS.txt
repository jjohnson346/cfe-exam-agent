Examiners must also be aware that it might be possible to recover previously printed 
documents. Although the odds of recovery can be low depending on a variety of factors, 
understanding how retrieval can be achieved can be of great value to the investigator.  
 
In addition to using printer-spool files to recover previously printed documents, many 
printers have internal hard drives that may contain information relevant to a fraud 
examination. In general, any information sent to and stored by a printer is recoverable unless 
the printer has overwritten the data.

Furthermore, some printers have memory buffer — temporary storage area of jobs waiting to be 
printed — which may also contain important information. Information contained in memory 
buffer, however, is generally limited to recently created and stored data.
