Reporting and Testifying 
The reporting and testifying phase is where the hours of analysis are reported fairly and 
objectively. In this phase, a qualified computer forensics expert may be asked to render an 
opinion about the use or misuse of a computer system. This is where experience and training 
are tested and where examiners must know with certainty that their opinion is based on their 
research, knowledge, and experience and that an opposing expert will not find fault with 
their conclusions.
