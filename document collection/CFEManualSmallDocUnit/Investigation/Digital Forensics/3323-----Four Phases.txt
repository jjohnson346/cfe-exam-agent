Four Phases 
There are several definitions and different schools of thought for investigations involving 
computer forensics, but all practitioners in the field will agree that investigations typically 
involve four phases: seizure, image acquisition, analysis, and reporting and testifying.  
 
Each phase is dependent on the phases that come before it. For instance, if the seizure phase 
is handled incorrectly, then each of the following phases can suffer and ultimately render the 
reporting and testifying phase moot.
