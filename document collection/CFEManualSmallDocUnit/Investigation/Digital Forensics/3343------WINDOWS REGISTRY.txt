WINDOWS REGISTRY 
The Windows registry is a central database that stores settings and configuration for the 
operating system and most applications installed on the system. The registry is an important 
source of potential evidential data because it contains information on user accounts, typed 
URLs, networks shared, the run command history, and so on. Often, software used by the 
fraudster will create a footprint in the registry that can provide valuable insight into relevant 
activity that occurred in the system.
