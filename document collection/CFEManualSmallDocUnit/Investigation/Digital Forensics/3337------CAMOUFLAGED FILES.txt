CAMOUFLAGED FILES 
A user might camouflage certain files under an innocent name or different file extension to 
prevent others from discovering them. For example, a suspect might change a file name 
from “evidence.doc” to “install. exe” and place the file in a directory that stores program 
files. Therefore, examiners should analyze a target’s hard drive to determine whether any file 
types have been camouflaged. This is done by analyzing the file header — the first bits of data 
in a file — which contains data identifying the file format.
