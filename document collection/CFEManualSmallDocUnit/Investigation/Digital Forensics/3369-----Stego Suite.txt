Stego Suite 
The Stego Suite by WetStone is a software bundle available for the investigation, detection, 
analysis, and recovery of digital steganography. It identifies the presence of steganography 
without prior knowledge of the steganography algorithm that might have been used against 
the target file.  
 
WetStone’s Stego Suite comprises four products: Stego Watch, a steganography tool; Stego 
Analyst, an image and audio file analyzer; Stego Break, a password cracker; and the recently 
added Stego Hunter, a steganography application identifier.

Postmortem analysis of data recovered from a digital crime scene can be a tedious process. 
When the digital data contains thousands of images, audio files, or digital video that may 
contain other hidden evidence, the process can be impossible without the aid of key 
technologies and expertise. Stego Suite’s tools provide the ability to quickly examine and 
evaluate digital image and/or audio data for the presence of hidden information  
or communications. 
 
Active Web scanning of a website to ensure that unauthorized people are not using the site 
to exchange innocuous-looking messages or smuggle proprietary data is also becoming a 
must. The tools of Stego Suite baseline a Web domain and continuously scan the domain for 
the presence of hidden data inside digital images.
