ProDiscover Forensics  
Produced by Technology Pathways, ProDiscover Forensics is a computer security tool for 
law enforcement that enables computer professionals to find all the data on a computer disk 
while protecting evidence and creating evidentiary quality reports for use in legal 
proceedings. 
 
Features 
• Creates bit-stream copy of the disk to be analyzed, including a hidden HPA section 
(patent pending), to keep original evidence safe 
• Searches files or an entire disk including slack space, HPA section, and Windows 
NT/2000/XP Alternate Data Streams for complete disk forensic analysis 
• Previews all files, even if hidden or deleted, without altering the data on a disk, including 
file metadata 
Digital Forensics  Investigation 
3.732   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• Maintains multi-tool compatibility by reading and writing images in the pervasive UNIX 
dd format 
• Examines and cross references data at the file or cluster level to ensure nothing is 
hidden, even in slack space 
• Automatically generates and records MD5, SHA1, or SHA256 hashes to prove  
data integrity 
• Examines FAT12, FAT16, FAT 32, and all NTFS file systems, including Dynamic Disk 
and Software RAID, for maximum flexibility 
• Examines Sun Solaris UFS file system and Linux ext2/ext3 file systems 
• Integrates graphics thumbnail viewer and registry viewer 
• Integrates Windows event log viewer 
• Extracts Internet history 
• Utilizes Perl scripts to automate investigation tasks 
• Extracts EXIF information from JPEG files to identify file creators 
• Automated report generation in XML format saves time and improves accuracy and 
compatibility 
• GUI interface and integrated help function ensures a quick start and ease of use 
• Designed to NIST Disk Imaging Tool Specification 3.1.6 to ensure high quality 
 
ProDiscover Forensics is a tool for computer forensics analysis. It is not possible to hide 
data from ProDiscover Forensics as it reads the disk at the sector level. This least intrusive 
approach also allows the investigator to examine the files without altering any valuable 
metadata, such as last time accessed. ProDiscover Forensics will not alter any data on the 
disk. ProDiscover Forensics can recover deleted files, examine slack space, and access 
Windows Alternate Data Streams. It can even allow the investigator to preview, search, and 
image the Hardware Protected Area (HPA) of the disk with a patent-pending process. 
 
ProDiscover Forensics lets the investigator search through the entire disk for keywords and 
phrases with full Boolean search capability to find the data they want. Investigators can use 
the hash comparison capability to find known illegal files or to weed out known good files, 
such as standard operating system files, by employing the included data from the National 
Drug Intelligence Center in their Hashkeeper database. ProDiscover Forensics search 
capability allows searches for words or phrases anywhere on the disk, including the slack 
space.

ProDiscover Forensics automatically creates evidentiary quality reports needed to document 
results, complete with every file and hash signature where evidence was found. This saves 
time and prevents errors that might compromise an investigator’s case.
