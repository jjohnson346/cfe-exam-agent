Retention of Records 
The Bank Secrecy Act set forth a system of reporting and recordkeeping requirements 
designed to help track large or unusual financial transactions. The Act consists of two titles. 
Title I contains provisions requiring financial institutions and securities brokers and dealers 
to keep extensive records of the transactions and accounts of their customers. Title II of the 
Act (originally entitled Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act) requires banks, 
“financial institutions” (which include casinos, securities brokers and dealers, currency 
exchanges, and others), and, in some cases, individuals to report certain transactions to the 
government.
