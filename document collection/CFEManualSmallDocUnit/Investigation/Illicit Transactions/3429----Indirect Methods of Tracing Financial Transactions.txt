Indirect Methods of Tracing Financial Transactions 
In contrast to the direct approach method of proving income, which relies on specific 
transactions, the indirect approach relies on circumstantial proof of income using such as the 
net worth analysis. 
 
Almost all individuals and business entities determine income by the specific-items or 
specific - transactions method. Most entities engaged in legitimate pursuits maintain books 
and records in which they record transactions as they occur, and their income computations 
are based upon the total transactions during a given period. In fraud examinations, income 
can usually be established more readily by the direct approach; for this reason, it should be 
used whenever possible. 
 
In many fraud schemes, however, a subject’s books and records are not made available to 
the examiner. Therefore, an indirect approach must be taken using one of the following 
methods: the net worth analysis: asset method, the expenditures (source and application of 
funds) method, or the bank deposit analysis method. Although these methods are 
circumstantial proof, courts have approved their use in civil and criminal cases on the theory 
that proof of a subject’s unexplained funds or property might establish a prima facie 
understatement of income.
