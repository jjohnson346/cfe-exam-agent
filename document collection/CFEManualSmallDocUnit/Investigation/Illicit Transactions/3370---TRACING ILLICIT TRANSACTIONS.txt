TRACING ILLICIT TRANSACTIONS 
 
Interviewing witnesses to obtain financial data involves the systematic questioning of people 
who have knowledge of the events, the people involved, and the physical evidence 
surrounding the case. Financial interviewing is not unlike other kinds of interviewing. But in 
financial interviews, evidence often develops in bits and pieces that, when viewed separately, 
might appear to lead nowhere. Frustration is common, and tactics and techniques might 
have to be modified. Diligence, patience, and persistence are essential for successful results.
