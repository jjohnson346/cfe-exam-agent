CLEARINGHOUSE ITEMS 
Clearinghouse items  are those that must clear through other local banks and are therefore sent 
to a local clearinghouse for processing, and they include those items that are sent to out-of-
 town banks, such as Federal Reserve Banks. Because tracking down these items will involve 
obtaining records from third-party banks, the tracing process might be more time 
consuming and will probably require legal process. 
 
To determine whether an item is an on-us item or a clearinghouse item, first look to see 
whether the bank on which the check was drawn is the same as the bank in which it was 
deposited. If the names are not the same, check the endorsements on the back of the check. 
If the item has a different bank’s endorsement or  a Federal Reserve bank’s endorsement, it is 
a clearinghouse item. The endorsement should contain the name of the processing bank or 
its transit number.
