DISCOVERY SAMPLING 
This is the best type of sampling for auditing for fraud because it is sampling until one 
occurrence is found. Discovery sampling deals with the probability of discovering at least 
one error in a given sample size if the population error is a certain percentage. This type of 
sampling is directed toward a specific objective, such as: 
 
EXAMPLE 
“If I believe some kind of error or irregularity might exist in the records, what sample size will I have to 
audit to have assurance of finding at least one example?”

intercompany sales that have been improperly classified as sales to outsiders.
