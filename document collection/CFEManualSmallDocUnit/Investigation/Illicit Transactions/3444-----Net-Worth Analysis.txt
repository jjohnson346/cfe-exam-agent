Net-Worth Analysis 
Any recipient of funds, whether honest or suspect, has only four ways of disposing of 
income: save it, buy assets, pay off debts, or spend it. 
 
Net-worth analysis begins with the completion of a suspect’s financial profile. Through 
identification of the suspect’s assets, liabilities, income, and expenses, a net-worth statement 
can be determined. Once a net-worth statement is completed through the identification of a 
suspect’s assets, liabilities, income, and expenses, changes in the suspect’s net worth can be 
compared to his known income, and differences can be inferred to be from unknown 
sources.
