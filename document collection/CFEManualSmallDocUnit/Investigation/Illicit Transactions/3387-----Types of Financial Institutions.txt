Types of Financial Institutions  
Banks are classified primarily by their major services. 
• Commercial banks  offer businesses and individuals such services as checking accounts, 
loans, and exchange instruments. 
• Savings banks  and savings and loan associations  handle savings accounts and mortgage loans. 
• Trust companies  handle property for others under various types of fiduciary 
accommodations. 
 
Many banks combine all three services. Banks are organized under either state or national 
banking laws. 
 
The basic bank functions are as follows: 
• Receive deposits 
• Pay checks 
• Transfer funds 
• Make loans 
• Collect sundry financial instruments 
• Hold and administer property for others 
• Perform other services, such as renting safe deposit boxes
