Bank Statements 
A bank statement is a summary of all the transactions of a bank account. Bank statements 
are provided for all types of bank accounts, including checking accounts, money market 
accounts, savings accounts, CAP accounts (used by those who often deal in securities 
transactions), and others. 
 
Bank statements are helpful because they contain important information. In general, the 
details on a bank statement include the name and address of the bank, the name and address 
of the account holder, the account number, the opening balance, a record of all debit 
transactions (e.g., cash withdrawals from a teller, automated-teller machine (ATM) cash 
withdrawals, ATM payments, check payments, online payments, debit card payments, bank 
fees, etc.), a record of all credit transactions (e.g., direct transfers, cash deposits, check 
deposits, etc.), and the closing balance.  
 
Bank statements summarize the financial activity of the account holder for a specific period 
(usually a month). If a credit card is tied to the account, the bank statement also reflects 
credit card balances but usually not specific transactions.  
 
Today, bank statements are mailed to account holders or are accessible online. Some banks 
still return original checks along with the bank statements to the account holder; others 
provide pages with smaller facsimiles of the front and back of each check. 
 
Generally, bank statements contain a wealth of information. In most bank statements, 
financial activity in the account is shown along with a tied credit card balance. Typically,
