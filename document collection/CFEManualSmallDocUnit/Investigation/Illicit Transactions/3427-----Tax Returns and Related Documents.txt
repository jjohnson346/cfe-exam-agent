Tax Returns and Related Documents 
Personal tax returns, if available, might provide indirect evidence of illicit payments, such as 
profits or losses from previously undisclosed business ventures, or interest and dividends on 
hidden CDs and bank accounts. The returns might also reveal deductions and expenses, 
such as real estate taxes, that can lead to previously unknown funds or assets. Commercial 
bribes are often reported as consulting fees or other miscellaneous income. The target’s 
accountant and tax preparer should also be interviewed, and their files and work papers 
subpoenaed, if possible.
