COMPARATIVE NET WORTH: ASSET METHOD  
Again, the asset method is advisable when it is suspected that the subject has purchased 
assets or otherwise increased his net worth. It can be applied for any number of years, but, 
ideally, it is best to start with the year before the suspected fraudulent activity began. The 
formula is: 
 
 Assets 
– Liabilities 
= Net worth 
– Prior year’s net worth 
= Net worth increase 
+ Living expenses 
= Income (or expenditures) 
– Funds from known sources 
= Funds from unknown sources 
 
In computing the comparative net worth, these issues should be considered: 
• All assets should be valued at cost, not fair market value. Subsequent appreciation or 
depreciation of assets is ignored. 
• The amount of funds available to the subject from legitimate sources should be 
estimated or computed generously. The amount of the subject’s expenditures,

particularly hard-to-document living costs, such as food and entertainment, should be 
estimated conservatively to give the subject the benefit of any doubt. In attempting to 
estimate personal living expenses, you should consult the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
This agency publishes an annual table that details personal living expenses such as 
utilities, food, and gas. 
• Always attempt to interview the subject to identify all alleged sources of funds and to 
negate defenses that he might raise later. 
 
To compute the comparative net worth using the asset method, perform the following steps: 
• Establish the starting point, generally the year before the target’s illegal activities begin. 
This will be referred to as “year one” in the following computations. 
• Compute the target’s net worth at the end of year one. Identify all assets held by the 
subject, valued at cost, including assets acquired earlier, and the amount of current 
liabilities. 
 
The difference between the value of the assets and the liabilities is the target’s net worth at 
year one, or “opening net worth.” 
 
EXAMPLE 
Year One 
Assets at Cost               Liabilities 
Residence $100,000  Mort gage balance $ 90,000 
Stocks and bonds 30,000  Automobile loan  
Automobile 20,000  balance 10,000 
 TOTAL $150,000  TOTAL $100,000 
 
Assets $150,000
 Liabilities -100,000
 Net Worth $50,000
  
Compute the target’s net worth for year two, using the same method.

EXAMPLE 
Year Two 
                     Assets at Cost                                          Liabilities 
Residence $100,000  Mortgage balance $50,000 
Stocks and bonds 30,000    
Automobile 20,000  Automobile loan  
CD 50,000  balance  0  
 TOTAL $200,000  TOTAL $50,000  
 
Assets $200,000
 Liabilities -50,000
 Net Worth $150,000
  
Note that in the example the target’s net wo rth increased by $100,000 during year two. 
To determine the source of such an increase, determine the target’s known income, 
during year two, and subtract known expenses for year two. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Year Two 
               Income                            Expenses 
Salary $30,000  Mortgage interest 
payments 
 
$20,000 
Commissions 20,000  Living expenses 10,000  
 TOTAL $50,000  TOTAL $30,000 
   
The difference between the target’s income and expenses equals the increase (or decrease) in 
net worth from year one to year two, which can be attributed to known sources. Here it is 
$20,000. Subtract the increase in net worth fr om known sources from the total increase in 
net worth to determine the amount from unknown sources. 
 
EXAMPLE 
 Total increase in net worth $100,000 
 Increase attributed to known sources <20,000>  
 Dollars from unknown sources $80,000 
 
Repeat the above steps for subsequent years as necessary.
