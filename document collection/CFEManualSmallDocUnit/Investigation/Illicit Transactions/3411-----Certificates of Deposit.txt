Certificates of Deposit 
Certificates of deposit  (CDs) are interest bearing investment products that provide limited access 
to the money invested and a modest rate of interest. CDs are intended to be held until 
maturity, at which time the money may be withdrawn together with the accrued interest. 
Many banks impose penalties on money with drawn from a CD before maturity.
