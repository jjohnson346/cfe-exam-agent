SEARCHES FOR HARD ASSETS 
• The ownership of real property may be discoverable through the use of property 
searches, to the extent that they are available at the local or county level within individual 
states. 
• The ownership of vehicles can be inferred through the use of the DMV Vehicle Name 
Index, to the extent that the records within the controlling state agency reflect vehicles 
registered to a specific person or organization at a particular address. Conversely, the 
ownership of a particular vehicle may be inferred from the DMV vehicle registration 
searches. 
• An assumed business name search may be helpful in identifying a sole proprietorship 
business in which attachable assets are available.  
• The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is extraordinary in that it can be useful in a wide 
variety of business situations. A search of UCC filings can help identify personal 
property that an individual or business has financed. UCC filings can also disclose when 
and where a debtor obtained personal loans, the type of property that he pledged to the 
lender to secure the loan, and the debtor’s current address 
• The ownership of an aircraft can be determined by searching the Aircraft Ownership 
Database by business name, person name, or wing number.
