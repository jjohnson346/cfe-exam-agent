Financial Crimes Enforcement Network 
The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)—an organization established by the 
U.S. Department of the Treasury—collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence on 
financial crimes. Its mission is to provide a government-wide, multisource intelligence and 
analytical network to support law enforcement agencies in the detection, investigation, and 
prosecution of financial crimes. The participating agencies are the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; U.S. Customs Service and Border Protection; Drug 
Enforcement Administration; Federal Bureau of  Investigation; Internal Revenue Service; 
U.S. Marshals Service; Postal Inspecti on Service; and U.S. Secret Service.  
 
FinCEN’s financial database c ontains information from reports required under the Bank 
Secrecy Act, including the Currency Transaction Report; Report of International 
Transportation of Currency or Monetary In struments; Currency Transaction Report by 
Casinos and Card Clubs and by Depository Institutions; Reports of Foreign Bank and 
Financial Accounts; Registrations of Money Services Businesses; Designation of Exempt 
Person; and Suspicious Activity Reports by Depository Institutions, Securities and Futures 
Industries, Insurance Industries, Casinos and Card Clubs, and Money Services Businesses. 
Furthermore, FinCEN has access to data from IRS Form 8300 (Reports of Cash Payments 
Over $10,000 Received in a Trade or Business). 
 
FinCEN produces two types of products: tactical support documents and strategic analyses. 
The tactical support products either provide information and leads on criminal organizations 
and activities that are under investigation by law enforcement or proactively identify 
previously undetected criminal organizations and activities so that investigations can be 
initiated. The FinCEN’s work product can also assist in identifying assets for seizure and 
forfeiture purposes and supporting ongoing investigations. Its strategic analyses look at 
financial crimes and money laundering with an emphasis on the future. FinCEN collects,

processes, analyzes, and develops intelligence on emerging trends, patterns, and issues 
related to the proceeds of illicit activities. 
 
FinCEN uses the majority of its resources to assist agencies in investigations of the financial 
aspects of the illegal narcotics trade. FinCEN then prioritizes investigations of such non-
 narcotic crimes as money laundering, Bank Secrecy Act violations, corruption, treason, 
bankruptcy fraud, financial institution fraud, and government contract fraud. In both the 
narcotic and non-narcotic areas, FinCEN concentrates on investigations of national or 
international criminal organizations.
