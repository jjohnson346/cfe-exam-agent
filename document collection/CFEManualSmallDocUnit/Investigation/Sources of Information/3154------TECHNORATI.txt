TECHNORATI 
Technorati is a search engine for websites like YouTube, MySpace, Blog, Xanga, and so 
forth. The engine searches blogs with a variety of filters. A user can search by entering a 
topic into the Technorati search field, or he can use some of the site’s search categories, 
including photos, videos, and blogs. Using Technorati’s Advanced Search option, the 
examiner can narrow down a search to a particular blog and search by tags to sites that are 
linked to a particular blog. Although getting started with Technorati can be difficult, it can 
be a very useful resource.
