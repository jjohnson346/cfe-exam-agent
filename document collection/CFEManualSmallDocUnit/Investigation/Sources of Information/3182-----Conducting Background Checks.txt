Conducting Background Checks  
This type of search activity generally involves two broad areas: discovering what the public 
records reveal with respect to individuals and businesses with whom the subscriber may wish 
to do business and discovering information about prospective employees. In general, online 
public records databases are generally the best sources of background information. 
 
But before conducting any background checks, consult with legal counsel.
