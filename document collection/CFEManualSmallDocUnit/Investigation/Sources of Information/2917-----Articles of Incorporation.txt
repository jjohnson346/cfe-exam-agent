Articles of Incorporation 
Corporations are formed by filing articles of incorporation with the secretary of state (or 
state corporation bureau or corporate registry office) in the state of which the company does 
business. These corporate records are public record and will include: 
• Corporate name 
• Ownership information 
• Stock value 
• Initial shareholders 
• Names of the directors and officers 
• Registered agent 
• Location of the principal office 
• Date of incorporation 
• Standing/status 
 
This information will permit the investigator to review a corporate structure, identify the 
registered agent, and trace incorporation dates. The records will often include limited 
partnership information as well. The examiner can also use these records to verify the 
state(s) in which a company is registered as a corporation.
