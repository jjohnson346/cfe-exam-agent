Negotiating 
Another method to obtain relevant documents is to negotiate with a party to the 
investigation as part of a deal to cooperate in exchange for leniency. In some cases, third-
 party facilitators, or others marginally involved in the wrongdoing, may agree to produce 
records and cooperate in exchange for a release of liability, indemnity, or commitment to 
continue the business relationship. Counsel and management must, of course, be involved in 
such decisions, as well as the fidelity bond carrier, if a claim is to be made under the bond.
