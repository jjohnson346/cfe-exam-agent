National Motor Vehicle Title Information System 
Established by the Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992, the National Motor Vehicle Title 
Information System (NMVTIS) is an electronic database used to authenticate and exchange 
key vehicle history data, such as titling information and certain theft data. The primary 
reason for creating the NMVTIS was to address the lack of conformity among state vehicle 
documentation laws, which is one of the key factors contributing to title fraud.  
 
The new database, which went into full effect on January 1, 2010, is designed in part to 
prevent title washing, which occurs when a vehicle’s brand (i.e., a permanent designation 
indicating that the vehicle has incurred damage through collusion, flood, fire, or other 
incident that requires repair) is removed by re-titling the vehicle in another state that does 
not carry forward any brands on the new title.
