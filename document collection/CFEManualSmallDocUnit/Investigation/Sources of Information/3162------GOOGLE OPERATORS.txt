allintitle: Restricts results to those containing 
all the search terms specified in the 
title 
[ allintitle: mortgage fraud ] will 
return only documents that 
contain the words mortgage  and 
fraud in the title. 
allintext: Returns documents containing all the 
search terms in their text 
[ allintext: fraud skimming 
materiality ] will return only pages 
in which the words fraud, skimming, 
and materiality  appear in the text of 
the page. 
* Treated as a placeholder for one or 
more words 
[ “fraud * alert” ] tells Google to 
find pages containing a phrase that 
starts with fraud  followed by one or 
more words, followed by alert. 
 
In addition, Google operators can be combined. For example, the query [site:hp.com 
filetype:pdf “5010 LaserJet” printer FAQ] will search for an Adobe Acrobat PDF file of 
frequently asked questions regarding the 5010 LaserJet printer located on the Hewlett 
Packard website. 
 
There are numerous other operators and search techniques that work with each Google 
search service. A good resource for less-known Google operators and search tips is
