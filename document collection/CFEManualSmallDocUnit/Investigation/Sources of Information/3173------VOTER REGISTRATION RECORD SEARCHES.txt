VOTER REGISTRATION RECORD SEARCHES 
In a few states, voter registration records are available, but as with DMV records, they may 
not be updated frequently. However, to the extent that date of birth information is available, 
such records can augment other searches. Also note any legal restrictions attached to the use 
of voter information.
