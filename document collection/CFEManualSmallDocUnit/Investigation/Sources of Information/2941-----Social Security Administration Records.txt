place of birth, sex, race, parents’ names, and address at time of application. If a Social 
Security number is known, it might lead to helpful information regarding the location where 
the card was issued. Because many people apply for a Social Security number at a young age, 
these records can help to locate an individual’s place of birth.  
 
There are nine digits in the Social Security number. With the exception of the 700 series, the 
first three digits reflect the state of issue. Some states and Puerto Rico have more than one 
series of numbers. The last six digits are individual identifiers. Here is a listing of the states 
of issue of the first three digits:
