• Contractors, engineers, electricians, and architects 
 
The licenses and applications granted by the state might be public record. Although some 
applications contain no more than a name and address, other applications contain lengthy 
personal information, such as previous residential addresses, previous employers, education 
and training, and financial statements. Some agencies are required to conduct a background 
investigation before issuance of a license. 
 
Also, the state regulatory or licensing agency might have the authority to suspend or revoke 
the licenses necessary for the business to operate. 
 
Many professional organizations maintain their own listings of members or licensees. They 
might be reluctant to provide information beyond the person’s name and current standing in 
the association.
