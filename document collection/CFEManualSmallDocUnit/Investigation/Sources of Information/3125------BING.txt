BING 
Bing (formerly Live Search, Windows Live Search, and MSN Search) is the current Web 
search engine from Microsoft. Bing automatically groups search results in different 
categories, depending on the type of searches users are conducting. Bing also provides the 
ability to save and share search histories via Windows Live SkyDrive, Facebook, and e-mail. 
 
In addition to providing many of the same search resources found in other popular engines 
(e.g., it provides searches specific to travel, video, pictures, and maps), Bing has several 
useful features. For example, Bing maintains an ongoing history of searches, giving 
researchers a way to identify what they looked up and in what order. And Bing’s image 
search is easier to manage than others because it displays more images on the results screen.
