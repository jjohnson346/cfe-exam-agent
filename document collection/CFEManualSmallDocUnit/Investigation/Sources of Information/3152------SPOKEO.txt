SPOKEO 
Spokeo is a social-network aggregator site that gathers information about people by 
searching for their e-mail addresses on various social-networking sites. Essentially, it is 
designed to locate and track online profiles within social networks. This site allows users to 
search by a person’s name, e-mail address, or phone number. This can be helpful if an 
examiner knows about the subject’s profile in Facebook and Myspace but is not aware that 
the subject is also a member of Hi5 and Xanga.

For investigators and researchers, this is an incredible tool that gathers subject information 
in a way that other research tools cannot. One of Spokeo’s best features is its ability to track 
activity on members’ profiles. If the subject posts something on one of the popular social-networking 
sites, such as MySpace or Facebook, the post will appear in Spokeo’s search 
results and that person will be tracked for future updates.  
 
Spokeo allows a user to search and track a limited number of e-mail addresses or names for 
free, but requires a fee after a certain number of searches.
