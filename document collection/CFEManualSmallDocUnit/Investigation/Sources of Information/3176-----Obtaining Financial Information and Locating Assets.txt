Obtaining Financial Information and Locating Assets 
Discovering whether assets exist, where they exist, and whether they are recoverable can be 
accomplished with a search of federal, state, local, and proprietary records. These records 
can be further divided into those identifying “hard” assets and those regarding the potential 
for assets, credit capacity, or credit worthiness.
