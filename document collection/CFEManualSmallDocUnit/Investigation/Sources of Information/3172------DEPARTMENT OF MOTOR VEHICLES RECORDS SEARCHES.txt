DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES RECORDS SEARCHES 
Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) records used to be good locator tools, but recent 
restrictions on them have reduced the effectiveness of such searches. Before Congress 
amended the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act in 1999, drivers could “opt out” and ask that 
their personal information (e.g., Social Security numbers, photographs, etc.) not be released. 
Under the amended law, however, drivers are no longer required to opt out; instead, the 
amended law imposes an “opt in” system requiring that drivers provide express 
authorization for the release of information. Moreover, individual states may not update 
their records frequently enough to provide the examiner with useful information. Searches 
such as Driver Identification can be useful on a spot basis, however.
