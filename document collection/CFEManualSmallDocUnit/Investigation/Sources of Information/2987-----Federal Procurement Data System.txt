Federal Procurement Data System 
The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) collects, develops, and disseminates federal 
contracting information. Many federal agencies report their contracts and purchases to the 
FPDS, which catalogs the information for government and public use. Contracts agreed 
upon as long ago as 1978 are searchable. The FPDS is best source for federal procurement 
information, and its website (www.fpds.gov) is also fairly explanatory and easy to navigate.
