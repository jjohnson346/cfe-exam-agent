ICEROCKET 
Icerocket offers a unique array of tools. Backed by Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas 
Mavericks, Icerocket was designed to track what people were searching for. It focuses 
primarily on blogs, using meta-tagging to categorize and index the content contained within 
blogs. As a result, a user can search by keyword, which captures any relevant matches found 
on a website and prioritizes matches marked as tagged searches. 
 
Like Technorati, Icerocket also allows users to  narrow down blog searches with an advanced 
search link or by using search operators, such as title, author, and tag. For example, a search

for [title:“public records”] would find pages with  “public records” in their title. Similarly, a 
search for [title:“public records” author:“John Doe”] will return blog posts by John Doe that 
have “public records” in their title. 
 
In addition to searching blogs, Icerocket searches through image directories, Twitter, and 
MySpace. Even though an examiner can search MySpace directly, the Icerocket search 
engine tool for MySpace presents a more traditional search environment.
