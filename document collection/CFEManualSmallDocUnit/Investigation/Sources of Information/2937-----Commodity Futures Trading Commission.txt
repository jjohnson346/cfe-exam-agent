Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974 created the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission (CFTC), and it empowered the CFTC to regulate all futures trading in 
the United States. The CFTC imposes speculative position limits on futures contracts as 
needed to eliminate, decrease, or deter the burdens on interstate commerce that may result 
from excessive speculation. Moreover, the CFTC, through its affiliation with the National 
Futures Association (NFA), provides a dispute-resolution program for customers and 
members.  
 
This CFTC maintains the following information: 
• Registration information concerning firms and individuals 
• Administrative and injunctive actions filed by the CFTC against firms and individuals 
• Financial reports filed by CFTC registrants 
• Customer complaints filed against CFTC registrants
