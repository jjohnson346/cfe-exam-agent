Laws Governing Access to Information 
Despite the public’s broad right of access to public records, there are numerous laws that 
limit access to certain types of information, and a number of risks to privacy are raised by 
the collection of information. Therefore, fraud examiners must be certain that any 
information obtained is done so legally.
