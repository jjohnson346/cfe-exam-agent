The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) is a leading not-for-profit organization 
dedicated to preventing, detecting, and defeating insurance fraud and vehicle theft through

3.466   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
information analysis, investigations, training, and public awareness. The NICB combats auto 
theft by investigating cases referred to it by insurers and through its online databases.  
 
The NICB publishes the Passenger Vehicle Identification Manual  annually. This manual contains 
the structure and decoding of vehicle identification numbers (VINs) from the last three 
model years for most U.S. and Canadian passenger vehicles, including light-duty trucks  
and motorcycles.  
 
The NICB publishes the Commercial Vehicle and Off-Road Equipment Identification Manual  every 
five years. This manual contains the structure of vehicle identification numbers for 
commercial vehicles and the structure of product identification numbers (PIN) for off-road 
equipment from the last five model years.  
 
These manuals also include: 
• Summary of the Federal Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard, which requires VIN 
markings on major parts of passenger vehicles that are part of high-theft lines 
• General information on VIN structure and decoding of trucks, tractors, and trailers 
along with PIN structure and decoding for off-road equipment 
• Glossary of vehicle-related terminology 
 
VINCheck is another service available from  the National Insurance Crime Bureau. NICB’s 
VINCheck is a service provided to the public to  assist in determining if a vehicle has been 
reported as stolen. NICB’s VINCheck database contains vehicles that have been reported 
stolen by cooperating NICB members, but not recovered. A Vehicle Identification Number 
(VIN) is required to perform a search. This information is made available, free of charge, as 
a public service to help consumers determine whether a specific vehicle has been reported as 
stolen and to assist NICB and law enforcement in locating stolen vehicles. A maximum of 
five VINCheck searches can be conducted within a 24-hour period. 
 
In the 1980s, states and regions experiencing high levels of auto thefts began to form Anti-
 Car Theft (ACT) groups, funded by voluntary grants from coalitions of law enforcement 
groups, state funds, insurers, and consumers, to promote public awareness of vehicle theft 
and lobby for the passage of state legislation aimed at combating thefts. A few states have 
enacted Automobile Theft Prevention Authorities (ATPAs), which are nonprofit 
organizations dedicated to preventing motor vehicle thefts. States that have active ATPAs 
include Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Louisian a, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania,

Texas, and Washington. State ATPAs are mostly funded by a small surcharge on drivers’ 
licenses or registration fees, or on auto insurance policies sold in the state.
