Exercise Audit Clause Rights 
An audit clause allows the parties to access the books of the other party. Thus, absent 
subpoena power, examiners may need to use audit clause rights to access contractor and 
subcontractor records and financial accounts.  
 
Unfortunately, most audit clauses are too narrow to provide useful information. However, if 
properly constructed, an audit clause can be a powerful method by which on-book 
information can be obtained.
