Law Enforcement Support Center 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Law Enforcement Su pport Center (LESC) 
serves as a national operations center by providing timely immigration status and identity 
information to local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies on aliens suspected, 
arrested, or convicted of criminal activities. The LESC operates 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week, responding to requests from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies with 
information gathered from eight DHS databases, the National Crime Information Center 
(NCIC), the Interstate Identification Index (III), and other state criminal history indices.  
 
In addition to providing real-time assistance to law enforcement agencies that are 
investigating, or have arrested, foreign-born individuals involved in criminal activity, the 
LESC also performs the following investigative functions: administers and controls 
immigration-related cases for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); provides 
support to a host of ongoing multiagency investigative initiatives; acts as the central point of 
contact for the FBI’s National Instant Criminal  Background Check System (NICS) program; 
handles queries and field responses relating to national security employment issues; provides 
the law enforcement community with NCIC hit confirmation information; and offers ICE 
special agents and deportation officers after-hours support via digitally recorded duty lines 
confirmed with personal identification numbers.
