Interactive Data Electronic Applications  
In August 2008, the SEC unveiled the successor to the agency’s EDGAR database, which 
will give investors far faster and easier access to key financial information about public 
companies and mutual funds. The new system is called IDEA, short for Interactive Data 
Electronic Applications. Based on a completely new architecture being built from the 
ground up, it will at first supplement and then eventually replace the EDGAR system.  
 
Currently, most SEC filings are available only in government-prescribed forms through 
EDGAR. Investors looking for information must sift through one form at a time, and then 
re-keyboard the information — a painstaking task. With IDEA, investors will be able to 
instantly collate information from thousands of companies and forms, and create reports 
and analysis on the fly, in any way they choose.  
 
In 2009, however, CaseWare International, the developer of IDEA — Data Analysis 
Software, filed suit against the SEC over the use of the IDEA name. That same year, the 
SEC agreed to discontinue its use of the mark IDEA. At this point, it is not clear what the 
SEC will call its new system.
