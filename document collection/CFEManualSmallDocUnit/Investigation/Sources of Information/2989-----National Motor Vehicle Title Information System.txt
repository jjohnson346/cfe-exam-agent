National Motor Vehicle Title Information System 
Established by the Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992, the National Motor Vehicle Title 
Information System (NMVTIS) is an electronic database used to authenticate and exchange 
key vehicle history data, such as titling information and certain theft data. The primary 
Investigation  Sources of Information 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.449 
reason for creating the NMVTIS was to address the lack of conformity among state vehicle 
documentation laws, which is one of the key factors contributing to title fraud.  
 
The new database, effected on January 1, 2010, is designed to prevent title washing, which 
occurs when a vehicle’s brand (i.e., a permanent designation indicating that the vehicle has 
incurred damage through collusion, flood, fire, or other incident requiring repair) is removed 
by re-titling the vehicle in a state that doesn’t carry forward any brands on the new title.
