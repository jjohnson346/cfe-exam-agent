Banking Records 
Bank records are perhaps the single most important external financial source available to a 
fraud examiner. In addition to their use as evidence for fraud, banking records might provide 
leads on sources of funds, expenditures and personal affairs. These records help the 
examiner construct a paper trail to prove the fraud.  
 
Some of the records that should be reviewed, if available, are: 
• Account opening documentation 
• Monthly account statements 
• Checks written on the account 
• Loan files 
• Safe deposit box records 
• Currency transaction reports 
• Bank collection department records 
• Mortgage loan files
