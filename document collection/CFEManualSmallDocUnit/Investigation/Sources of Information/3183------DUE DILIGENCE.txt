DUE DILIGENCE 
As business organizations seek to identify vendors, clients, or strategic partners or seek to 
loan or collect money, they frequently conduct public record inquiries focused on other 
businesses or individuals who are principals of business organizations. This type of public 
record inquiry involves such issues as verification of application information, debt burden, 
adverse financial information, credit capacity or worthiness, business relationships (the so-called 
family tree), litigation history, and criminal background. Useful searches include the 
following: 
• Corporate/limited partnership searches are available in all states to verify information, 
identify principals, and develop other business relationships. 
• Bankruptcy filings, tax liens, and judgments searches respond to issues of adverse 
financial information and credit capacity/worthiness. 
• UCC filings answer questions of debt burden. This search will be helpful to identify 
hidden ownership or partnership interests, and it will be helpful to locate address 
information on debtors. 
• State and federal civil court records provide answers to questions concerning litigation 
history, past business relationships, and the potential for debt burden either as a function 
of an adverse judgment or as a function of financing expensive litigation. 
• State and federal criminal court records identify the possibility of a criminal background. 
• The use of consumer credit reports and business credit reports helps resolve questions 
concerning credit capacity and creditworthiness. In addition, the business report is useful 
in verifying information, understanding business relationships, and developing basic 
financial information about an organization. 
• Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) searches may be useful in 
developing adverse information or verifying information given by a prospective vendor, 
client, or strategic partner.

• Aircraft mechanics, airmen, medical license, DEA controlled substances, and other 
licenses may serve to verify that basic professional and occupational standards are met by 
a prospective vendor, client, or strategic partner.
