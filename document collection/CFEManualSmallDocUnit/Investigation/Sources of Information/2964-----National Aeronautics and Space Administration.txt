National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is responsible for the nation’s 
public space program and long-term aerospace research. More than 90 percent of NASA’s 
multibillion-dollar budget goes to NASA contractors. Files maintained by its Office of 
Procurement contain information about a contractor and its employees. NASA requires that 
contracting firms submit the following data with their proposals: name and qualifications of 
the contractor and resumes of the personnel who will be directly assigned to the project. The 
resumes should include educational background, work experience, length of service with the 
firm, and projects on which these individuals have worked.
