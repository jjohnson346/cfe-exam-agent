Building Permit Records 
If a business or individual constructs a new building or makes improvements to an existing 
building, there should be a building permit on file with the local building authority. In 
addition, before most businesses can open their doors, the city or county may require that 
they possess certain permits. The local fire department may require permits ensuring that the 
business complies with the fire code. The city health department will require permits for 
restaurants or other businesses that serve food. Planning and zoning departments enforce 
regulations regarding the types of businesses and their locations.
