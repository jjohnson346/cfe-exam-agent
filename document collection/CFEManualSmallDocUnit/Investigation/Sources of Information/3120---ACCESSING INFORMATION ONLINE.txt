ACCESSING INFORMATION ONLINE 
 
Fraud examiners now have a number of online investigative resources available through their 
personal computers. But not so long ago, examiners had to travel to the county courthouse 
or state capital to search for public records. Fraud examiners today, however, have enough 
information available through different online sources to conduct entire inquiries without 
leaving their seat.
