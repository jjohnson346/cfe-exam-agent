VIRTUAL LIBRARY  
The Virtual Library (VL) is the oldest catalog of the Web, started by Tim Berners-Lee, the 
creator of the HTML that makes the Internet possible. Unlike commercial catalogs, it is run 
by a loose confederation of volunteers who compile pages of key links for particular areas in 
which they have expertise. While not the biggest index of the Web, the VL pages are widely 
praised as guides to particular sections of the Internet.
