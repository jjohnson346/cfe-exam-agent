Fictitious Business Names/Doing Business As Information 
Doing business as (DBA) information is typically filed at the county level, though many 
states require filing with at the state level as well. Most states also require limited 
partnerships, trusts, and joint ventures to file DBA information at the state or county level. 
This information will provide insight into the true business venture behind the name. DBA 
information is very similar to corporate filings with the secretary of state, and they allow 
examiners to trace the corporation’s roots or  prove ownership in sole proprietorships, 
partnerships, limited partnerships, joint ventures, and trusts.
