Memoranda 
• Exhibits, documents, or enclosures 
• Indexes 
• Cover page 
• Transmittal letter 
 
The long-form report will consist of copies of these documents. The Linda Reed Collins 
case study report, included in the Appendix to this section, illustrates this approach.  
 
The heart of the documentation is the memorandum of interview, and one memorandum 
should be prepared for each official contact. Once all the memoranda of interviews are 
completed, they are typically assembled in chronological order and indexed.  
 
Memoranda 
Use memoranda to document all interviews and other pertinent information discovered 
during the examination. Each memorandum should contain the following information where 
appropriate: 
• Heading 
• File number or control number 
• Name of person reporting 
• Case name or subject 
• Subject of memorandum 
• Date 
• Details of facts 
• Interview was voluntary 
• Indicate that one provided one’s identity 
• The witness was informed of the nature of the inquiry 
• Date of inquiry 
• How the interview was conducted (in person, by telephone, etc.) 
• If the interview was electronically recorded 
• Facts learned during inquiry
