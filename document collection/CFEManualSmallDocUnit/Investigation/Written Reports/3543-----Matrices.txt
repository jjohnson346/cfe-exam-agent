Matrices 
A matrix is a grid that shows the relationship (or points of contacts) between a number of 
entities. Known contacts can be differentiated from presumed contacts by means of a bullet 
(l) or a circle (m). 
 
A matrix can be used to identify the direction and frequency of telephone traffic between 
suspect parties.
