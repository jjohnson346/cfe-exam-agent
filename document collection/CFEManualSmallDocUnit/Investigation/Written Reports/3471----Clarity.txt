Clarity 
Investigative reports on fraud examinations should convey pertinent information in the 
clearest possible language. If necessary, quote the respondent directly (provided the 
quotation does not distort the context). Only convey objective facts  (i.e., unbiased evidence that 
is not influenced by personal feelings, interpretations, or prejudice); do not editorialize or 
give judgments. Use complex or technical terms in their proper contexts, and, where 
necessary, explain their meaning. Do not use jargon since the report might be read by people 
who are not familiar with esoteric or technical terminology.
