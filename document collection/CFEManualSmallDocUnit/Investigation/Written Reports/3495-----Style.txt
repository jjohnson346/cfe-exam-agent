Style 
Write each report in a style that is clear, concise, and to the point. Poorly constructed or 
grammatically incorrect sentences can ruin an otherwise flawless fraud examination. The 
purpose for writing a report is to convey information to a reader; therefore, it is the 
examiner’s responsibility to communicate effectively  and efficiently. The two cardinal sins of 
report writing are vagueness and wordiness. Common breaches of good basic writing include: 
• Improperly placed or ambiguous modifiers (changes sentence context) 
• Use of technical jargon, slang, and/or colloquialisms (places the burden to understand 
on the reader) 
• Use of unnecessary, high-flown verbiage (in an attempt to impress the reader)
