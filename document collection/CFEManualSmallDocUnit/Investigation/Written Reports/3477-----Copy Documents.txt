Copy Documents 
Most evidence in fraud cases will be in document form. When operating under a lawful court 
order that compels a custodian to furnish original documents, the examiner should copy 
those documents (preferably in the presence of the custodian). Then the examiner should 
furnish the custodian with a receipt describing the documents copied or taken. A sample 
receipt can be found in the Sample Report in the Appendix to this section.
