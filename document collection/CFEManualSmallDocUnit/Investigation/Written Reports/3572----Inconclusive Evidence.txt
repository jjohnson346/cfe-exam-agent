RE: [Fraud Examination] 
 
Dear Mr./Ms. [                    ]: 
 
We have conducted a fraud examination concerning a possible [misappropriation of assets] 
of [Company Name]. This examination was predicated upon [information resulting from a 
routine audit of the company’s books by  the company’s internal auditors]. 
 
Our examination was conducted in accordance with lawful fraud examination techniques, 
which included [an examination of books and records; voluntary interviews of appropriate 
personnel; and other such evidence-gathering procedures as necessary under the 
circumstances]. 
 
The results of our examination are inconclusive. Because of the nature of fraud, no 
assurances can be given that fraud does not exist. However, based on our examination, there 
is currently insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that [the assets in question were 
misappropriated]. 
  
Sincerely,
