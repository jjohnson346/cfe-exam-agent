Record Selection  
Specific record selection is accomplished by a request or query of the computer to find the 
occurrences of items or records in a field. This type of request will only return instances 
where the record did occur, effectively reducing large amounts of information into concise 
lists. Often, additional criteria placed on the record selection or query will reveal a more 
pertinent list of information. Most data analysis programs include simple Find macros to 
help locate specific records.
