JOURNAL ENTRY GAP TESTS 
Gaps may signal incomplete data processing or, in the situation of journal entries, possible 
hidden entries. Usually, a method of documenting these occurrences, along with a review by 
an independent party, is sufficient to ensure the completeness and accuracy of processing. 
However, it is rare that a journal entry gap test is performed in the accounting department (it 
is more common in the accounts payable area related to the check sequence), so this may be 
the first time this test is being performed. 
 
Gaps in the journal entry sequence should be reviewed with the accounting department. The 
test work should answer the following questions: 
• What procedures are in place to document and approve all gaps in the sequences? 
• How are gaps communicated to management?
