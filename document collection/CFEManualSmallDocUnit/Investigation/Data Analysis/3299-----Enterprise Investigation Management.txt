Enterprise Investigation Management 
Norkom Technologies’s Enterprise Investigation Management software is case management 
software for anti-money laundering and fraud investigations. It links information from 
multiple insider sources like foreign travel reporting databases and debriefings, employee 
security background information, network logs, and cyber activity logs to compose a picture 
of potential insider security threats. This composite approach puts otherwise disconnected 
pieces of information in context to help prevent sensitive information and capabilities from 
being compromised. For more information on Enterprise Investigation Management visit
