SUMMARIZE ACTIVITY BY USER ACCOUNT 
This test looks for: 
• Standard names such as “default” or “test.” These names usually have equally simple 
passwords for a hacker to guess and should generally be avoided. Replacements to these 
generic user IDs would be specific IDs associated with the person using the system (e.g., 
“jsmith”). 
• Unrecognized or terminated employees. This test focuses on the responsiveness within 
the MIS function to ensure that only authorized employees have system access. Compare 
the list created by this test to an active employee roster to spot any violations.

• Users who have access beyond their level of responsibility. This access may highlight a 
nonsegregation of duties in which a person has an opportunity to commit fraud by being 
able to initiate, authorize, and/or record a transaction. 
 
The resulting report should be reviewed bearing in mind the above considerations. 
Recommended steps include: 
• Delete default passwords and replace them with specific IDs 
• Delete employees who are not on the active employee roster 
• Review users who are posting high activity or who may have access to other non-
 segregated functions and assess whether other controls are needed to mitigate the such 
individuals’ access
