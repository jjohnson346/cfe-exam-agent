END RELATED TO SPECIFIC ACCOUNTS 
Nonstandard journal entries are generally those that are posted manually, rather than 
through an automated feed from a fixed asset or accounts receivable sub-ledger. Such entries 
are more prone to error and fraud mainly due to human error, the judgment applied to 
support the entry, and the possibility of an override by management in authorizing the entry. 
This is especially true for entries made just after year end (related to the prior year), as these 
entries are more prone to be adjustments for the fiscal year’s annual reporting. 
 
Given the above, the test for these entries should include: 
• Reviewing the journal entry and associated supporting documentation 
• Ensuring the approvals are appropriate for the size and nature of the journal entry 
• Assessing whether generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are being applied
