FOR CHANGES 
This report will identify changes in the customer masterfile, such as additions and deletions. 
Given that most systems do not track the changes in the customer masterfile (e.g., there is 
no “Last Maintained on Date” field), this report is sometimes the only means of determining 
changes in the customer master.  
 
The fraud examiner should review major additions and/or deletions to the customer 
masterfile. Given that there is a high potential for fraud on newly added customers (e.g., 
posting false sales invoices to phony customer accounts to inflate period-end sales balances), 
the names and addresses for such customers should be reviewed against employees with the 
ability to enter invoices into the system. This can be done using the accounts payable test 
described in this book that matched vendor addresses to employee addresses. Since this 
exercise may detect fraud, it may be beneficial to locate the invoices or customer files 
independent of the accounts receivable department (which may be culpable for creating the 
false customer accounts).
