EMPLOYEE-TO-VENDOR ADDRESS MATCH 
This test identifies identical or similar fields between the master tables of vendors and 
employees in an attempt to identify fraudulent payments to employees. While this test 
explains how to complete this task for addresses, the same could be done for phone 
numbers, tax identification numbers, and other personal information. 
 
Once the results are produced, the auditor should  scan them to determine if there are any 
valid address matches between the employee and vendor tables. As a next step, a Query 
Sheet could be created of the actual invoices posted to any questionable vendor to determine 
if they are fraudulent. Two notes when completing this review are: 
• Because this exercise may detect fraud, it may be beneficial to locate the invoices or 
vendor information independent of the accounts payable department (who may be 
culpable for creating the false vendor account). 
• Because it is common to pay employee travel and entertainment expenses or employee 
advances, this should be the key reason to not consider the payments fraudulent. If 
possible, the vendor file should be filtered for all employee travel and entertainment 
vendor accounts prior to running this test.
