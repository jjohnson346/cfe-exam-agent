IDENTIFY EXCEEDED PURCHASE ORDERS 
This report works to identify authorization issues within an accounts payable process 
whereby the invoices paid exceed the approved purchase order amounts. Aside from 
assessing the authorized limits, this report tests the system control that should not allow an 
invoice to be paid above a predetermined limit (normally between 5 and 10 percent). 
The report may also highlight frauds: 
• In which a valid purchase order is provided to authorize payment, yet inflated payments 
are made to assist the fraudster in some way. 
• In which vendors working with an employee create a purchase order with valid unit 
prices, yet inflate those prices when the invoices are sent. 
 
This test may highlight a control issue within the computer system (which should check for 
exceeded purchase orders), or it may identify numerous overrides to the computer system. 
These overrides may be within the normal course of business (e.g., purchase order prices 
were meant to be at the invoice price rate, but were entered in error on the purchase order), 
but may also highlight fraudulent activity. Regardless, the auditor should walk through the 
process of entering a purchase order and associated invoices to understand the system 
controls. Once understood, the differences presented in this test can be investigated by 
vouching to purchase order and invoice documentation.
