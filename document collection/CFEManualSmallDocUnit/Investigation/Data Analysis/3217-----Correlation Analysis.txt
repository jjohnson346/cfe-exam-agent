Correlation Analysis 
Using this function, investigators can determine the relationships between different variables 
in the raw data. Investigators can learn a lot about computer data files by learning the 
relationship between two variables. For example, we should expect a strong correlation 
between these independent and dependent variables because a direct relationship exists 
between the two variables. Hotel costs should increase as the number of days traveled 
increases. The gallons of paint used should increase as the number of houses built increases. 
You can probably use many more of such relationships. 
 
Independent Variable Dependent Variable 
Number of days traveling Hotel cost 
Number of documents printed Reams of paper used 
Number of houses built Paint used
