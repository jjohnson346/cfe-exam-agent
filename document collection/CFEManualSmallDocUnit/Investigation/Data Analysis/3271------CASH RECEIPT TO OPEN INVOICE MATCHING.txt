CASH RECEIPT TO OPEN INVOICE MATCHING 
This test helps assess the existence and valuation of open invoices at period end based on 
the cash received subsequent to year end. Therefore, it is one of the most popular tests used 
by fraud examiners in assessing the existence of period end invoices.

Based on this test, the fraud examiner can easily assess whether open invoices were paid with 
cash (and therefore existed at year end), and for those still outstanding, whether they should 
be reviewed further from the perspective of year-end valuation. Such invoices probably 
relate to customers who regularly pay late, but they could represent new customer payment 
issues and/or fraudulent sales posted at year-end that will never receive cash.
