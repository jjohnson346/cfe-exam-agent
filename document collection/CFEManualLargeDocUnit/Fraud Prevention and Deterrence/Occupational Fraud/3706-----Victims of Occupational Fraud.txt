Victims of Occupational Fraud 
As part of our survey, we asked each respondent to provide demographic information about 
the organization that was defrauded. We believe it is useful to measure the different ways in 
which occupational fraud impacts different types of organizations. Our hope is that this 
analysis may enable organizations to better identify where to strengthen or focus their anti-
 fraud efforts based on the experiences of other similar organizations. 
 
TYPES OF VICTIM ORGANIZATIONS  
More than 40% of victim organizations in our study were privately owned businesses, and 
nearly one-third were publicly traded companies, meaning that almost three-quarters of the 
victims represented in our study came from for-profit enterprises. Sixteen percent of the 
frauds reported to us occurred at government agencies. Not-for-profit organizations were 
the least represented category, with less than 10% of frauds taking place at these entities.

In addition to experiencing the most frauds, private and public companies were also victims 
to the costliest schemes in our study; the me dian loss for the cases at these businesses was 
$231,000 and $200,000, respectively. In cont rast, the losses experienced by government 
agencies and not-for-profit organizations were about half as much. Government agencies 
had a median loss of $100,000, while not-for-profits lost a median of $90,000.  
 
Organization Type of Victim —Median Loss  
 
SIZE OF VICTIM ORGANIZATIONS 
Continuing the trend observed in our prior studies, small organizations — those with fewer 
than 100 employees — suffered the greatest percentage of the frauds in our 2010 study, 
accounting for more than 30% of the victim organizations. However, the variation between 
size categories is relatively small, with 23% of victims having between 100 and 999 
employees, 26% having 1,000 to 9,999 employees, and 21% having more than 10,000 
employees. 
 
This relatively small disparity contrasts with our previous studies, in which small 
organizations were involved in a much higher percent of frauds than any other category. 
Additionally, our research has historically shown that smaller organizations suffer 
disproportionately large losses due to occupational fraud. Organizations with fewer than 100 
employees experienced the greatest median loss of all categories of victim organizations in 
our 2008 study. The same was true in our 2006 study.

INDUSTRIES OF VICTIM ORGANIZATIONS 
We looked at the industry classification of the organizations victimized by the fraud cases in 
our study. It is important to view this data as a representation of the companies that had 
CFEs investigate internal fraud cases within the last two years, rather than as an indication of 
which industries are more or less likely to be victimized by fraud. However, the following 
tables do draw attention to some differences in the frequency and cost associated with 
occupational frauds among different sectors. For example, the banking and financial services 
industry had the most cases, accounting for more than 16% of the frauds reported to us. The 
period of time covered by our survey — calendar years 2008 and 2009 — was filled with news 
stories of fraud in the banking sector, so this finding is not unexpected. In contrast, the 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Occupational Fraud

mining industry experienced the fewest frauds in our study, but those cases caused a median 
loss of $1 million—by far the largest of  any of the industries we examined.47

media n loss data.

VICTIM’S ANTI-FRAUD CONTROLS AT TIME OF FRAUD 
We asked survey participants which of several common anti-fraud controls were in place at 
the victim organization during the perpetration of the fraud. A distinction should be made 
between the following data and the prior discussion on fraud detection methods. The 
following analysis covers the mere presence of each control — not necessarily its role in 
detecting the fraud once it started. More than three-quarters of the victim organizations in 
our study had their financial statements audited by external auditors, while two-thirds had 
dedicated internal audit or fraud examination departments, and almost 60% had independent 
audits of their internal controls over financial reporting. Additionally, nearly 70% of the 
organizations had a formal code of conduct in place at the time of the fraud, though only 
39% extended that to include a formal anti-fraud policy. 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Occupational Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    4.635  
As mentioned in our discussion on fraud detection method, tips are the number one means 
by which fraud is detected. However, less than half of the victim organizations in our study 
had a hotline in place at the time the fraud occurred. There is evidence that the presence of a 
hotline improves organizations’ ability to detect fraud and limit fraud losses, which should 
cause more organizations to implement fraud hotlines. 
 
Frequency of Anti-Fraud Measures 48  
 
 
ANTI-FRAUD CONTROLS IN SMALL BUSINESSES  
We have long hypothesized that many small companies are particularly susceptible to fraud, 
at least partially due to the limited resources they devote to anti-fraud controls. To test this 
theory, we compared the presence of anti-fraud controls at those companies with fewer than 
100 employees to the controls at companies with more than 100 employees. Our findings 
confirm what we suspected: The small companies in our study did indeed have fewer 
controls in place than the larger organizations — a factor that may contribute to the 
disproportionate impact of fraud on these companies. While discrepancies in levels of 
certain controls are somewhat expected given the associated costs or resources required to 
enact them, the gap between controls in small businesses as opposed to larger organizations 
is striking. For example, it would be expected that small businesses would have a lower rate 
of external audits and that fewer small companies would have a formal internal audit or 
                                                 
48The sum of percentages in this chart exceeds 100% because many victim  organizations had more than one 
anti-fraud control in place at the time of the fraud.

fraud examination function. But even less expensive controls were often absent in small 
businesses. While 64% of large companies had so me sort of management review of controls, 
processes, accounts, or transactions, less than half as many small businesses had the same 
type of monitoring in place. Likewise, formal codes of conduct and anti-fraud policies cost 
very little to implement, but serve as an effective way to make a clear and explicit statement 
against fraudulent and unethical conduct within an organization. Yet only 41% and 16% of 
small businesses had these policies (respectively) in place when the fraud occurred —
numbers dwarfed by the 83% and 50 % rates of larger organizations. 
 
Perhaps most concerning is that only 15% of small businesses had a hotline in place, 
compared to 64% of larger organizations. As previously discussed, our research shows that 
hotlines are consistently the most effective fraud detection method. Further, the median loss 
for frauds at companies with hotlines was 59% smaller than the median loss for frauds at 
organizations without such a mechanism. Arguably, enacting hotlines would go a long way in 
helping small-business owners protect their assets from dishonest employees. 
 
Frequency of Anti-Fraud Controls by Size of Victim Organization  
 
 
EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS  
We compared the median loss experienced by those organizations that had a particular anti-
 fraud control against the median loss for those organizations without that control at the time 
of the fraud. Hotlines were the control with the greatest associated reduction in median loss, 
reinforcing their value as an effective anti-fraud measure. Employee support programs, 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Occupational Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    4.637  
surprise audits, and fraud training for staff members at all levels were also associated with 
median loss reductions of more than 50%. In terestingly, financial statement audits—the 
most commonly implemented control—was among the controls with the smallest associated 
reduction in median loss.
