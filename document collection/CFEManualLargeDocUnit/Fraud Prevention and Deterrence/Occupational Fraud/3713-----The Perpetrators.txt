The Perpetrators 
We asked respondents to provide information about the fraud perpetrators in their cases so 
we could better understand how occupational fraud levels and losses are related to 
demographic information such as age, job type, gender, education, and position of authority. 
In cases where there were multiple offenders, the responses relate to the principal 
perpetrator—the person identified by the CFE as the primary culprit in the case. The 
following is a summary of the data we received.  
 
PERPETRATOR’S POSITION 
We asked survey respondents whether the perpetrator was an employee, a manager, or an 
owner/executive. Below we see that the distribution of cases based on the perpetrator’s 
position was fairly similar to what we found in our 2008 study, although the 2010 
distribution was slightly more skewed toward employees and managers. Not surprisingly, 
there was a strong correlation between the perpetrator’s position of authority and the losses 
caused by fraud. The median loss in owner/executive frauds was more than three times the 
loss caused by managers, and more than nine times higher than losses in employee fraud 
cases.

PERPETRATOR’S GENDER 
Two-thirds of the frauds in our study were committed by males, which is a higher percentage 
than we encountered in 2008, but consistent with the overall trend noted in prior reports 
that most occupational frauds are committed by men. 
 
Perpetrator’s Gender  
 
 
THE PERPETRATOR’S AGE 
The distribution of perpetrators based on their age was similar to our 2008 study, but the 
2010 perpetrators tended to be slightly younger. Our past reports have generally shown the 
highest levels of fraud to occur in the 36–5 0 age range, but this year we found more than 
half of all cases were committed by individuals between the ages of 31 and 45. Generally 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Occupational Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    4.639  
speaking, median losses tended to rise with the age of the perpetrator, which is consistent 
with our prior research. The most notable difference between 2008 and 2010 is the losses 
caused by perpetrators older than 60. In each study, however, we were dealing with fewer 
than 40 cases in that category. Given the small sample size, we believe this is more likely to 
be an anomaly than an indication of any particular trend.

PERPETRATOR’S CRIMINAL AND EMPLOYMENT HISTORY 
Only 7% of the fraud perpetrators in our study had been previously convicted of a fraud-related 
offense, which was virtually identical to our finding in 2008. Eighty-six percent had 
never been charged with or convicted of a prior offense. The low rate of prior convictions 
suggests that criminal background checks may have some effect in preventing fraud, but the 
effect is probably limited. 
 
Perpetrator’s Criminal History — Frequency

In addition to criminal history, past employment issues may indicate that an employee is 
more likely to engage in fraudulent conduct in the future. Of the respondents in our survey, 
791 were able to provide information about the perpetrator’s prior employment history. 
Among those cases, about 8% of perpetrators had been previously punished and 10% had 
been previously terminated for fraud-related conduct.

BEHAVIORAL RED FLAGS DISPLAYED BY PERPETRATORS 
While a fraud is ongoing, the perpetrator often displays certain behaviors or characteristics 
that might indicate he has a heightened risk of committing fraud. On their own, these 
behavioral red flags do not prove an individual is engaged in a fraud, but they should raise 
warning signals to the individual’s coworkers and managers, as well as the organization’s 
anti-fraud staff. When these red flags exist alongside other indicators of misconduct, this can 
be a strong clue that something is wrong. As discussed earlier in this report, occupational 
frauds often last for months or years before they are caught, so the ability to detect frauds as 
early as possible can have a big effect in limiting losses. 
 
We presented survey respondents with a list of common behavioral red flags and asked them 
to identify which of these warning signs had been displayed by the perpetrator prior to 
detection of the fraud. As shown in the following chart, the most common red flags 
displayed by perpetrators were living beyond financial means (43% of cases), experiencing 
financial difficulties (36%), excessive control i ssues with regard to their jobs (23%), and an 
unusually close association with vendors or customers (22%). This distribution is very similar 
Occupational Fraud  Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
4.642   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
to what we found in our 2008 study. As we continue to track this data in future studies, we 
hope to be able to identify consistent relationships between behavioral warning signs and the 
occurrence of occupational fraud. Ideally, this data will help organizations build better fraud-detection 
programs that incorporate behavioral data, in addition to more standard anti-fraud 
controls. 
 
Behavioral Red Flags Present During Fraud Scheme — Sorted by Frequency 49  
 
We also broke down the distribution of red flags based on the type of fraud. Different forms 
of occupational fraud result from different factors and circumstances, which we would 
expect to show up in the fraudsters’ behavior. As the following chart illustrates, individuals 
who engaged in financial statement frauds were much more likely than other perpetrators to 
exhibit control issues or to be under excessive pressure to perform within their organization. 
Meanwhile, living beyond one’s means and experi encing financial difficulties were not as 
common among financial statement fraudsters as others. This makes sense, because while 
asset misappropriations and corruption schemes are almost always committed to enrich the 
fraudster, in many financial statement schemes, other factors—such as meeting earnings 
                                                 
49 The sum of percentages in this chart exceeds 100% because in many cases perpetrators displayed more than 
one behavioral red flag.

forecasts or hitting budget targets — may be as much of a motivator as personal financial 
gain. An unusually close association with a vendor or customer was noted as a red flag in 
45% of corruption cases, which is not surprising given that most corruption frauds involve 
bribery or some kind of illicit benefit. A “wheeler-dealer” attitude was also more common in 
corruption cases than in other forms of fraud, and 42% of all corruption perpetrators were 
identified as living beyond their means. Among those who misappropriated assets, living 
beyond one’s means and financial difficult ies were the two most common red flags.
