Detection of Fraud Schemes 
One of the principal goals of our research is to identify how past frauds were detected so 
that organizations can apply that knowledge to their future anti-fraud efforts. Tips were by 
far the most common detection method in our study, catching nearly three times as many 
frauds as any other form of detection. This is consistent with the findings in our prior 
reports. Tips have been far and away the most common means of detection in every study 
since 2002, when we began tracking the data.  
 
Management review and internal audit were the second and third most common forms of 
detection, uncovering 15% and 14% of frauds, re spectively. It is also noteworthy that 11% 
of frauds were detected through channels that lie completely outside of the traditional anti-
 fraud control structure: accident, police notificat ion, and confession. In other words, 11% of 
the time, the victim organization either had to stumble onto the fraud or be notified of it by 
a third party in order to detect it.

SOURCE OF TIPS  
Not surprisingly, employees were the most common source of fraud tips. However, 
customers, vendors, competitors, and acquaintances (i.e., non-company sources) provided at 
least 34% of fraud tips, which suggests that fraud reporting policies and programs should be 
publicized not only to employees, but also to customers, vendors, and other external 
stakeholders. 
 
While tips have consistently been the most common way to detect fraud, the impact of tips 
is, if anything, understated by the fact that so many organizations fail to implement fraud 
reporting systems. Such systems enable employees to anonymously report fraud or 
misconduct by phone or through a web-based portal, otherwise known as hotlines. The 
ability to report fraud anonymously is key because employees often fear making reports due 
to the threat of retaliation from superiors or negative reactions from their peers. Also, most 
third-party hotline systems offer programs to raise awareness about how to report 
misconduct. Consequently, one would expect that the presence of a fraud hotline would 
enhance fraud detection efforts and foster more tips.

one detection method.
