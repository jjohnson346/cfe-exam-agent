Ethics for Fraud Examiners

The High Road 
Most public and many private discussions of ethics quickly become philosophical, reaching 
toward lofty principles and broad generalizations about desirable behavior. People easily cite 
well-known guides and believe the ideas in them should never be violated. Such discussions 
often take place in a vacuum, apart from real-world situations. People generally exhort 
themselves and others to observe the highest principles of moral behavior.  
 
Such considerations—the high road —are necessary if we desire to lift the discussion above 
the nitty-gritty facts of everyday problems. However, the idealistic nature of this level of 
discussion is often not sufficient to help people cope with a problem immediately at hand.

The high road is the realm of moral philosophy where philosophical principles guide the 
process of thinking about problems and distinguishing right from wrong. Such principles are 
necessary in the process of everyday life. Even though an individual might not know them in 
all the twists and turns familiar to philosophers, their fundamental precepts are well 
understood in our concept of common sense.
