Ethics for Fraud Examiners


:


Reporting  
Client or employer managers should not be allowed to overrule the Certified Fraud 
Examiner’s judgments on the appropriate content of a report. Integrity is destroyed and 
judgment is subordinated when the Certified Fraud Examiner is compelled to alter a report 
or to omit important information or to misstate facts. Certified Fraud Examiners must not 
let any feelings of misguided loyalty to the client, employer, or other sources of conflicts of 
interest interfere with their obligation to report fully and fairly.
