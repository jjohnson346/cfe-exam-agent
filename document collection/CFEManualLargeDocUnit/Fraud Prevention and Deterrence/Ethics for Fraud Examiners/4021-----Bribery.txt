Bribery 
Bribery  is the offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting of something of value for the purpose of 
influencing the action of an individual in the discharge of his duties. It can also include the 
securing of advantage over competitors by secret and corrupt dealing with employees or 
agents of prospective purchasers. 
 
Any indication (through audit, tip, complaint, or accidental discovery) that such action 
(bribery) has occurred, may have occurred, or could occur should be investigated until the 
Certified Fraud Examiner has established that it has occurred, or, within reasonable 
certainty, that it did not occur. 
 
In the example given, the fact that there is a major control weakness is the only predication 
needed to investigate the situation further to determine whether there was fraud.
