SKILLS, KNOWLEDGE, ABILITIES, AND EXPERIENCE 
Certified Fraud Examiners cannot be expected to have an expert level of skill and knowledge 
for every circumstance that might be encountered in a fraud examination. Nevertheless, 
Certified Fraud Examiners must have sufficient skill and knowledge to recognize when 
additional training or expert guidance is required. It is the responsibility of a Certified Fraud 
Examiner to ensure that necessary skills, knowledge, ability, and experience are acquired or 
available before going forward with a fraud examination.  
 
Certified Fraud Examiners must be skilled in obtaining information from records, 
documents, and people; in analyzing and evaluating information and drawing sound 
conclusions; in communicating the results of fraud examinations, both orally and in writing; 
and in serving as an expert witness when appropriate. 
 
Certified Fraud Examiners must be knowledgeable in investigative techniques, applicable 
laws and rules of evidence, fraud auditing, criminology, and ethics.
