Integrity and Competence 
 
A Certified Fraud Examiner shall, at all times, exhibit the highest level of integrity in the 
performa nce of all professional assignments, and will accept only assignments for which there 
is reasonable expectation that the assignment will be completed with professional 
competence. 
 
This rule contains two parts. The first deals with integrity and the second with competence. 
Competence here is related to diligence, as discussed previously in relation to the first rule in 
the Certified Fraud Examiner Code.  
 
Integrity 
If you were asked to name a desirable personal characteristic, integrity is one that would 
rank high on the scale, along with honesty, truthfulness, trustworthiness, and loyalty. 
Outside observers of Certified Fraud Examiners’ activity will look for signs of integrity as a 
signal that trust is warranted. However, integrity hardly exists apart from other 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  ACFE Code of Professional Ethics 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.1009 
characteristics well-known in moral philosophy and recognized in the Certified Fraud 
Examiner Code of Professional Ethics.  
 
Integrity requires honesty, truthfulness, trustworthiness, and confidentiality. It requires 
subordination of desires for personal gain to the interests of clients, employers, and the 
public. It requires independence of mental attitude and avoidance of conflicts of interest. 
Integrity is all these things wrapped up into one word.  
 
In addition, integrity means that a Certified Fraud Examiner ought to have a well- 
developed sense of moral philosophy—an ability to analyze situations where no rules of 
the Certified Fraud Examiner Code are specifically applicable and to be able to distinguish 
right from wrong. It does not mean, however, that a Certified Fraud Examiner must be 
perfect in all technical matters, nor does it mean that Certified Fraud Examiners and 
others cannot have honest differences of opinion. In the course of a fraud examination, 
inadvertent errors, mistakes of judgment, and other problems might cause conflict. In such 
cases, a Certified Fraud Examiner can preserve integrity either by admitting error or by 
convincingly justifying a difference of perception or opinion.  
 
Professional Competence 
Professional competence refers to how well Certified Fraud Examiners do their job. 
Determination of competence always depends on the specific facts and circumstances of the 
assignment. Competence is best understood in the context of the prudent practitioner. The idea 
of a prudent professional practitioner is present in other social science theories, for example, 
the “economic man” of economic theory and the “reasonable man” of law. This concept can 
be summarized for fraud examiners as follows:  
 
A prudent practitioner is assumed to have a knowledge of the philosophy and practice of 
fraud examinations, to have the degree of tr aining, experience, and skill common to the 
average fraud examiner, to have the ability to recognize indications of frauds, and to keep 
abreast of developments in the perpetration and detection of fraud. Competence requires the 
CFE to be acquainted with the company, activity, function, or program under 
investigation; to review the methods of control in operation; to obtain  sufficient evidence 
pertinent to the suspected fraud or illegal acti vity; to be responsive to unusual events and 
unfamiliar circumstances; to persist until any reasonable doubts about the evidence have 
been eliminated; and to exercise caution in instructing assistants and reviewing their work. 
 
ACFE Code of Professional Ethics   Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
4.1010   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
Professional competence also demands attention to three kinds of interference that can 
damage the independence and quality of a Certified Fraud Examiner’s work. Fraud 
examiners who permit these conditions to interfere with the assignment demonstrate less 
than the desired level of professional competence. The three types of interference are 
programming, investigation, and reporting.  
 
Programming  
Fraud examiners must remain free from interference by managers who try to restrict, specify, 
or modify the procedures they need to perform, including any attempts to assign personnel 
or otherwise to control the examination work. Occasionally, client or employer managers try 
to limit access to information or to other personnel or to limit the amount of time available 
for the assignment.  
 
Investigation  
When appropriate, Certified Fraud Examiners must have free access to books, records, 
correspondence, and other evidence. They must have the cooperation of managers or other 
employees without any attempt to interpret or screen evidence.  
 
Reporting  
Client or employer managers should not be allowed to overrule the Certified Fraud 
Examiner’s judgments on the appropriate content of a report. Integrity is destroyed and 
judgment is subordinated when the Certified Fraud Examiner is compelled to alter a report 
or to omit important information or to misstate facts. Certified Fraud Examiners must not 
let any feelings of misguided loyalty to the client, employer, or other sources of conflicts of 
interest interfere with their obligation to report fully and fairly.  
 
Professional Skepticism  
Fraud examiners must always perform their work with an attitude of skepticism, and begin 
with the belief that something is wrong or someone is committing a fraud (depending, of 
course, on the nature of the assignment and the preliminary information available). This 
attitude may make fraud examinations extensive and expensive. Relaxation of this initial 
attitude of skepticism occurs only when the evidence shows no signs of fraudulent activity. 
At no time is a Certified Fraud Examiner entitled to “assume” a fraud problem does not 
exist. Professional skepticism can be dispelled only by evidence. As a result, opinions or 
attestations about a fraud-free environment are absolutely prohibited for Certified  
Fraud Examiners.
