Professional Standards and Practices 
 
General Standards 
Independence and Objectivity 
Certified Fraud Examiners are responsible for maintaining independence in attitude and 
appearance, approaching and conducting fraud examinations in an objective and unbiased 
manner, and ensuring that examining organizations they direct are free from impairments  
to independence. 
 
ACFE Code of Professional Ethics   Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
4.1022   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
Qualifications 
Certified Fraud Examiners must possess the skills, knowledge, abilities, and appearance 
needed to perform examinations proficiently and effectively. Certified Fraud Examiners who 
are responsible for directing fraud examinations must ensure they are performed by 
personnel who collectively possess the skills and knowledge necessary to complete 
examinations in accordance with these Standards. Certified Fraud Examiners must maintain 
their qualifications by fulfilling continuing education requirements and adhering to the Code 
of Ethics of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. 
 
Fraud Examinations 
Certified Fraud Examiners must conduct fraud examinations using due professional care, 
with adequate planning and supervision to provide assurance that the objectives are achieved 
within the framework of these standards. Evidence is to be obtained in an efficient, 
thorough, and legal manner. Reports of the results of fraud examinations must be accurate, 
objective, and thorough. 
 
Confidentiality 
Certified Fraud Examiners are responsible for ensuring that they, and examining 
organizations they direct, exercise due care to prevent improper disclosure of confidential or 
privileged information. 
 
Specific Standards 
Independence and Objectivity 
ATTITUDE AND APPEARANCE 
Independence of attitude requires impartiality and fairness in conducting examinations and 
in reaching resulting conclusions and judgments. Certified Fraud Examiners must also be 
sensitive to the appearance of independence so that conclusions and judgments will be 
accepted as impartial by knowledgeable third parties. Certified Fraud Examiners who 
become aware of a situation or relationship that could be perceived to impair independence, 
whether or not actual impairments exist, should inform management immediately and take 
steps to eliminate the perceived impairment, including withdrawing from the examination  
if necessary. 
 
OBJECTIVITY 
To ensure objectivity in performing examinations, Certified Fraud Examiners must maintain 
an independent mental attitude, reach judgments on examination matters without undue 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  ACFE Code of Professional Ethics 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.1023 
influence from others, and avoid being placed in positions where they would be unable  
to work in an objective professional manner. All possible conflicts of interest should  
be disclosed. 
 
ORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIP 
The Certified Fraud Examiner’s reporting relationship should be such that the attitude and 
appearance of independence and objectivity are not jeopardized. Organizational 
independence is achieved when the Certified Fraud Examiner’s function has a mandate to 
conduct independent examinations throughout the organization, or by a reporting 
relationship high enough in the organization to ensure independence of action. 
 
Qualifications
SKILLS, KNOWLEDGE, ABILITIES, AND EXPERIENCE 
Certified Fraud Examiners cannot be expected to have an expert level of skill and knowledge 
for every circumstance that might be encountered in a fraud examination. Nevertheless, 
Certified Fraud Examiners must have sufficient skill and knowledge to recognize when 
additional training or expert guidance is required. It is the responsibility of a Certified Fraud 
Examiner to ensure that necessary skills, knowledge, ability, and experience are acquired or 
available before going forward with a fraud examination.  
 
Certified Fraud Examiners must be skilled in obtaining information from records, 
documents, and people; in analyzing and evaluating information and drawing sound 
conclusions; in communicating the results of fraud examinations, both orally and in writing; 
and in serving as an expert witness when appropriate. 
 
Certified Fraud Examiners must be knowledgeable in investigative techniques, applicable 
laws and rules of evidence, fraud auditing, criminology, and ethics. 
 
CONTINUING EDUCATION 
Certified Fraud Examiners are required to fulfill continuing education requirements 
established by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. Additionally, Certified Fraud 
Examiners are responsible for securing other education necessary for specific fraud 
examination and related fields in which they are individually involved.  
 
ACFE Code of Professional Ethics   Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
4.1024   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
CODE OF ETHICS 
Certified Fraud Examiners are to adhere to the Code of Professional Ethics of the 
Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. 
 
Fraud Examination 
DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE 
Due professional care is defined as exercising the care and skill expected of a prudent 
professional in similar circumstances. Certified Fraud Examiners are responsible for ensuring 
that there is sufficient predication for beginning a fraud examination; that said examinations 
are conducted with diligence and thoroughness; that all applicable laws and regulations are 
observed; that appropriate methods and techniques are used; and that said examinations are 
conducted in accordance with these standards. 
 
PLANNING AND SUPERVISION 
Certified Fraud Examiners must plan and supervise fraud examinations in a manner to 
ensure that objectives are achieved within the framework of these standards. 
 
EVIDENCE 
Certified Fraud Examiners must collect evidence, whether exculpatory or incriminating, that 
supports fraud examination results and will be admissible in subsequent proceedings, by 
obtaining and documenting evidence in a manner to ensure that all necessary evidence is 
obtained, and the chain of custody is preserved. 
 
REPORTING 
Reports of the results of a fraud examination, whether written or verbal, must address all 
relevant aspects of the examination and be accurate, objective, and understandable. 
 
In rendering reports to management, clients, or others, Certified Fraud Examiners shall not 
express judgments on the guilt or innocence of any person or persons, regardless of the 
Certified Fraud Examiner’s opinion of the preponderance of evidence. Certified Fraud 
Examiners must exercise due professional care when expressing other opinions related to an 
examination, such as the likelihood that a fraud has or has not occurred, and whether or not 
internal controls are adequate. 
 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  ACFE Code of Professional Ethics 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.1025 
Confidentiality 
Certified Fraud Examiners, during fraud examinations, are often privy to highly sensitive and 
confidential information about organizations and individuals. Certified Fraud Examiners 
must exercise due care so as not to purposefully or inadvertently disclose such information 
except as necessary to conduct the examination as required by law. 
 
Predication Standards 
Knowing when to initiate an examination will largely be driven by the source of the 
information. Information can be derived from a number of sources — a complaint, an 
anonymous tip, by accident, or through some proactive effort, such as an audit or survey. 
The value of the information has to be weighed and the creditability evaluated.  
 
The purpose of a preliminary inquiry is to determine if there is some creditable information 
that a fraudulent act has or will occur (a red flag). If so, what is the examiner’s responsibility?  
 
Preliminary inquiries should be conducted expeditiously and not used as a means of holding 
in abeyance a decision of initiating a formal fraud examination. If a sufficient number of 
fraud indicators exist, a fraud examination should be initiated. 
 
Because business activities/transactions are susceptible to fraudulent acts, all examinations 
should be approached with professional skepticism. That is, assume neither dishonesty nor 
unquestioned honesty of management/personnel. 
 
Bribery 
Bribery  is the offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting of something of value for the purpose of 
influencing the action of an individual in the discharge of his duties. It can also include the 
securing of advantage over competitors by secret and corrupt dealing with employees or 
agents of prospective purchasers. 
 
Any indication (through audit, tip, complaint, or accidental discovery) that such action 
(bribery) has occurred, may have occurred, or could occur should be investigated until the 
Certified Fraud Examiner has established that it has occurred, or, within reasonable 
certainty, that it did not occur. 
 
In the example given, the fact that there is a major control weakness is the only predication 
needed to investigate the situation further to determine whether there was fraud. 
ACFE Code of Professional Ethics   Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
4.1026   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
Conflicts of Interest 
This generally refers to a clash between public or corporate interest and the private 
pecuniary interest of an individual or individuals. It arises when an officer’s or employee’s 
personal or financial interest conflicts or appears to conflict with his official duties. 
 
Any indication that there may be a conflict of interest or that there appears to be a conflict 
of interest should be reviewed/investigated. This is particularly important if the 
agency/company does not require employees to sign conflict of interest statements annually, 
and there is no active prevention program such as a computer cross check of employee 
phone numbers and addresses with those of contractors and vendors. 
 
Embezzlement 
Embezzlement  is generally the fraudulent appropriation of property by one lawfully entrusted 
with its possession. It is the willful taking or conversion to one’s own use, another’s money 
or property of which the wrongdoer acquired possession lawfully by reason of some office, 
employment, or position of trust. 
 
Any indication that embezzlement has occurred or could be occurring should be 
investigated. If financial statements, inventory, or other documents appear out of order, no 
matter how innocuous or nonmaterial, a preliminary review should be made to determine if 
it is accidental or if a full scale investigation should be conducted. Again, the Certified Fraud 
Examiner should follow the situation until he is reasonably assured that there is no active 
fraud taking place. 
 
False Financial Statements 
This includes any false statement with regard to a corporation’s financial condition. It means 
something more than merely untrue or erroneous information. It also implies that the 
statement is decidedly untrue and deceitful, and made with the intention to deceive a person 
to whom the false statement is made or exhibited. 
 
Any indication that financial statements are not accurate requires further review to determine 
the reasons for their inaccuracy. While there may be legitimate reasons for the apparent 
inaccuracies, it is incumbent on the Certified Fraud Examiner to review the situation enough 
to determine those reasons and document his inquiry. 
 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  ACFE Code of Professional Ethics 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.1027 
False Statements 
False statements  include oral or written statements made knowingly false, or made recklessly 
without honest belief in their truth, and with the purpose to mislead or deceive. 
 
Any apparent inaccurate statements should be reviewed and the reasons for the inaccuracies 
documented, including the individuals responsible for the statements and the rationale 
behind them. If the inaccuracies seem more than minor discrepancies, or the reasons for the 
discrepancies appear unjustifiable, a full review may be necessary. 
 
Theft 
Theft  is the taking of personal property belonging to another from his possession, or from 
the possession of some person holding the same for him without his consent, with the intent 
to deprive the owner of the value of the same, and appropriating it to the use and benefit of 
the person taking it. 
 
Larceny 
Larceny  includes obtaining possession of property by fraud, trick, or device with a 
preconceived design or intent to appropriate, convert, or steal. 
 
For larceny and theft, if there is any indication or pattern that property is missing, it is 
important that the Certified Fraud Examiner review the situation to determine if a full- scale 
investigation is warranted.
