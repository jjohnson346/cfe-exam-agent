Ethics for Fraud Examiners


:


Specific Standards 
Independence and Objectivity 
ATTITUDE AND APPEARANCE 
Independence of attitude requires impartiality and fairness in conducting examinations and 
in reaching resulting conclusions and judgments. Certified Fraud Examiners must also be 
sensitive to the appearance of independence so that conclusions and judgments will be 
accepted as impartial by knowledgeable third parties. Certified Fraud Examiners who 
become aware of a situation or relationship that could be perceived to impair independence, 
whether or not actual impairments exist, should inform management immediately and take 
steps to eliminate the perceived impairment, including withdrawing from the examination  
if necessary. 
 
OBJECTIVITY 
To ensure objectivity in performing examinations, Certified Fraud Examiners must maintain 
an independent mental attitude, reach judgments on examination matters without undue 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  ACFE Code of Professional Ethics 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.1023 
influence from others, and avoid being placed in positions where they would be unable  
to work in an objective professional manner. All possible conflicts of interest should  
be disclosed. 
 
ORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIP 
The Certified Fraud Examiner’s reporting relationship should be such that the attitude and 
appearance of independence and objectivity are not jeopardized. Organizational 
independence is achieved when the Certified Fraud Examiner’s function has a mandate to 
conduct independent examinations throughout the organization, or by a reporting 
relationship high enough in the organization to ensure independence of action. 
 
Qualifications
SKILLS, KNOWLEDGE, ABILITIES, AND EXPERIENCE 
Certified Fraud Examiners cannot be expected to have an expert level of skill and knowledge 
for every circumstance that might be encountered in a fraud examination. Nevertheless, 
Certified Fraud Examiners must have sufficient skill and knowledge to recognize when 
additional training or expert guidance is required. It is the responsibility of a Certified Fraud 
Examiner to ensure that necessary skills, knowledge, ability, and experience are acquired or 
available before going forward with a fraud examination.  
 
Certified Fraud Examiners must be skilled in obtaining information from records, 
documents, and people; in analyzing and evaluating information and drawing sound 
conclusions; in communicating the results of fraud examinations, both orally and in writing; 
and in serving as an expert witness when appropriate. 
 
Certified Fraud Examiners must be knowledgeable in investigative techniques, applicable 
laws and rules of evidence, fraud auditing, criminology, and ethics. 
 
CONTINUING EDUCATION 
Certified Fraud Examiners are required to fulfill continuing education requirements 
established by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. Additionally, Certified Fraud 
Examiners are responsible for securing other education necessary for specific fraud 
examination and related fields in which they are individually involved.

CODE OF ETHICS 
Certified Fraud Examiners are to adhere to the Code of Professional Ethics of the 
Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. 
 
Fraud Examination 
DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE 
Due professional care is defined as exercising the care and skill expected of a prudent 
professional in similar circumstances. Certified Fraud Examiners are responsible for ensuring 
that there is sufficient predication for beginning a fraud examination; that said examinations 
are conducted with diligence and thoroughness; that all applicable laws and regulations are 
observed; that appropriate methods and techniques are used; and that said examinations are 
conducted in accordance with these standards. 
 
PLANNING AND SUPERVISION 
Certified Fraud Examiners must plan and supervise fraud examinations in a manner to 
ensure that objectives are achieved within the framework of these standards. 
 
EVIDENCE 
Certified Fraud Examiners must collect evidence, whether exculpatory or incriminating, that 
supports fraud examination results and will be admissible in subsequent proceedings, by 
obtaining and documenting evidence in a manner to ensure that all necessary evidence is 
obtained, and the chain of custody is preserved. 
 
REPORTING 
Reports of the results of a fraud examination, whether written or verbal, must address all 
relevant aspects of the examination and be accurate, objective, and understandable. 
 
In rendering reports to management, clients, or others, Certified Fraud Examiners shall not 
express judgments on the guilt or innocence of any person or persons, regardless of the 
Certified Fraud Examiner’s opinion of the preponderance of evidence. Certified Fraud 
Examiners must exercise due professional care when expressing other opinions related to an 
examination, such as the likelihood that a fraud has or has not occurred, and whether or not 
internal controls are adequate.

Confidentiality 
Certified Fraud Examiners, during fraud examinations, are often privy to highly sensitive and 
confidential information about organizations and individuals. Certified Fraud Examiners 
must exercise due care so as not to purposefully or inadvertently disclose such information 
except as necessary to conduct the examination as required by law.
