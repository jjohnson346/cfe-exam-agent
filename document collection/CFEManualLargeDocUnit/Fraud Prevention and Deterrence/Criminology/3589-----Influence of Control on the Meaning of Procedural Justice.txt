Influence of Control on the Meaning of Procedural Justice 
The Chicago Study assessed process control by questioning respondents about how much 
opportunity they had to state their case or present their problem. Decision control was 
measured by asking how much influence participants had over the determinations made by 
the third party in control. Most participants fe lt they had a high (43 percent) to moderate (20 
percent) level of process control. In contrast, a number of participants felt they had little 
decision control (about half said “not much at all”).  
 
The Chicago Study thus leads one to conclude that process control judgments is the deciding 
factor when assessing procedural justice in terms of control. Process control judgments are

also important in assessing how experience affects people’s evaluation of  procedural justice. 
Ergo, respondents are more concerned with their opportunities to speak out rather than 
their influence over the outcome. The belief of citizens that their views are being weighed 
and considered by the authorities and that the authorities are dealing fairly with them 
reinforces their belief in their own process and decision control. 
 
In the employment context, the study tends to support the idea that employees should be 
involved in the development of policies and procedures. Instead of just distributing a fraud 
policy or an ethics policy, send out a questionnaire asking employees for their ideas on how 
fraud and corruption can be prevented in the company. If employees feel they have some 
control over the rules, they will be more likely to obey and follow them.
