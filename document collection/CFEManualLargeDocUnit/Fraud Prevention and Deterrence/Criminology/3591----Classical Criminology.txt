Classical Criminology 
Classical criminology, based on the philosophical principle of utilitarianism, has its roots in 
the belief that human beings are rational and calculating creatures and therefore do things in 
order to avoid pain and produce pleasure. Some of the components of classical 
criminological theory are: 
• People have free will, which they can use to elect to engage in either criminal or 
noncriminal behavior. 
• Criminal behavior will be more attractive if the gains are estimated to be greater than  
the losses.

• The more certain, severe, and swift the reaction to crime, the more likely it is that the 
penalties will control the behavior. 
 
Two theorists’ names are associated with classical criminology: the Italian Cesare Beccaria 
and the Englishman Jeremy Bentham. Bentham, marvelously eccentric, willed that his body 
be preserved and placed in the entryway to the University of London and brought to the 
table when the faculty meets. His wishes were carried out, and the body can still be seen 
today by anyone visiting the school. 
 
The policy implications of classical criminological thought, which are prominent today in 
theories grouped under the heading of “rational choice,” are that penalties should be 
established that make the anticipated results of criminal behavior less appealing than the 
prospects of the losses, such as the loss of freedom. The theory also has a benevolent 
component in that it suggests that penalties that are too severe serve no purpose, since they 
are needlessly excessive for the deterrence they seek to achieve. 
 
Utilitarianism  remains a much-favored approach to crime, with its assumption that offenders 
will calculate potential gains and losses before they decide to disobey the law. The U.S. 
Sentencing Commission proposals are based almost totally on the idea of classical 
criminology, mandating that monetary penalties be calculated at a level that will induce 
companies to conclude that breaking the law is not fiscally appealing. 
 
There are several major difficulties inherent in the theory, though. The first, of course, is that 
many people do not stop and add up the gains and losses of lawbreaking before they engage 
in it. Second, the impact of penalties can be very different for different people; the thought 
of a week in prison may be awful to one person, but a piece of cake to another. Third, it is 
very difficult to know whether the penalty will in fact result from the behavior; most 
offenders optimistically assume that they will not be caught.
