DOWNWARD DEPARTURES 
The Guidelines list the following factors that could justify a downward departure:  
• Substantial assistance to the authorities in the investigation or prosecution of another 
organization or individual.  
• The organization is a public entity. 
• Members or beneficiaries (other than share holders) of the organization are direct victims 
of the offense. A downward departure in these cases may be warranted because a fine 
might increase the burden on the victims. 
• The organization has agreed to pay remedial costs that greatly exceed the organization’s 
gain from the offense. 
• The organization has an exceptionally low culpability score because: there was no 
involvement by anyone with substantial authority in the organization; there was an 
effective compliance program in place; and the base fine was determined by some means 
other than the organization’s gain from the offense.
