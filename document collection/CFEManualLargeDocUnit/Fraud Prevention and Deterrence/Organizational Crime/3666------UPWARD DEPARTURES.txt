UPWARD DEPARTURES 
When a court imposes a fine that is greater than the maximum fine provided by the

factors that could justify an upward departure: 
Organizational Crime  Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
4.522   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
• The offense involved a foreseeable risk of death or bodily injury. 
• The offense constituted a threat to national security. 
• The offense presented a threat to the environment. 
• The offense presented a risk to the integrity or continued existence of a market. 
• The offense involved official corruption. 
• The organization’s culpability score was reduced  because it had an effective compliance 
program, but the program was only implemented because of a court order or 
administrative order. In cases such as this, the court can impose an upward departure to 
offset all or part of the reduction. 
• The organization’s culpability score is greater than ten.
