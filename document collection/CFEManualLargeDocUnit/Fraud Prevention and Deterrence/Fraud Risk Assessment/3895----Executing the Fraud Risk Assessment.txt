Executing the Fraud Risk Assessment  
The execution of the fraud risk assessment can be approached in many ways. The approach 
should be tailored to the organization, but should be structured and rational to ensure its 
success.  
 
Choosing a Framework  
When conducting a fraud risk assessment, it is helpful to use a framework for performing, 
evaluating, and reporting on the results of the work. Fraud risk can be analyzed and reported 
both qualitatively and quantitatively using a consistent framework.  
 
The following sample fraud risk assessment frameworks illustrate how the elements of fraud 
risk assessment are applied under different approaches.  
 
Sample Fraud Risk Assessment Framework #1 1  
Using this framework, the fraud risk assessment team incorporates the following steps into 
the fraud risk assessment strategy: 
1. Identify potential inherent fraud risks. 
2. Assess the likelihood of occurrence of the identified fraud risks. 
3. Assess the significance to the organization of the fraud risks. 
4. Evaluate which people and departments are most likely to commit fraud and identify the 
methods they are likely to use. 
5. Identify and map existing preventive and detective controls to the relevant fraud risks. 
6. Evaluate whether the identified controls are operating effectively and efficiently. 
7. Identify and evaluate residual fraud risks resulting from ineffective or nonexistent 
controls. 
 
                                                 
1 This framework is based on information contained in Managing the Business Risk of Fraud: A Practical Guide, 
sponsored by the Institute of Internal Auditors, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and 
the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners.  
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Fraud Risk Assessment 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.813 
The framework begins with a list of identified fraud risks, which are assessed for relative 
likelihood and significance of occurrence. Next, the risks are mapped to people and 
departments impacted, and to relevant controls. Subsequently, the relevant controls are 
evaluated for design effectiveness and are tested to validate their operating effectiveness. 
Lastly, residual risks are identified, and a fraud risk response is developed to address them. 
The table below provides a visual representation of the steps involved in this framework, 
and can be filled in as the fraud risk assessment is performed.

Identify Potential Inherent Fraud Risks  
The fraud risk assessment team should brainstorm to identify the fraud risks that could apply 
to the organization. Brainstorming should include discussions regarding the following areas:

INCENTIVES, PRESSURES, AND OPPORTUNITIES TO COMMIT FRAUD  
When assessing incentives, pressures, and opportunities to commit fraud, the fraud risk 
assessment team should evaluate: 
• Incentive programs and how they may affect employees’ behavior when conducting 
business or applying professional judgment 
• Pressures on individuals to achieve performance or other targets and how such pressures 
may influence employees’ behavior 
• Opportunities to commit fraud that arise from weak internal controls, such as a lack of 
segregation of duties 
 
RISK OF MANAGEMENT’S OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS  
When considering the potential for management’s override of controls, the fraud risk 
assessment team should keep in mind that: 
• Management personnel within the organization generally know the controls and standard 
operating procedures that are in place to prevent fraud. 
• Individuals who are intent on committing fraud may use their knowledge of the 
organization’s controls to do it in a manner that will conceal their actions. 
 
POPULATION OF FRAUD RISKS  
The fraud risk identification process requires an understanding of the universe of fraud risks 
and the subset of risks that apply to a particular organization. It includes gathering 
information about the business itself, including its business processes, industry, and 
operating environment, as well as all associated potential fraud risks. Such information can 
be obtained from external sources—such as in dustry news outlets; criminal, civil, and 
regulatory complaints and settlements; and professional organizations and associations—and 
from internal sources by interviewing and brainstorming with personnel, reviewing 
complaints on the whistleblower hotline, and performing analytical procedures. 
 
Fraud risks can be classified into three major areas: fraudulent financial reporting, asset 
misappropriation, and corruption. Potential fraud risks to consider in each category are 
discussed below. 
 
FRAUDULENT FINANCIAL REPORTING  
Potential fraudulent financial reporting risks include: 
• Inappropriately reported revenues, expenses, or both 
• Inappropriately reflected balance sheet amounts, including reserves 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Fraud Risk Assessment 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.815 
• Inappropriately improved or masked disclosures 
• Concealed misappropriation of assets 
• Concealed unauthorized receipts, expenditures, or both 
• Concealed unauthorized acquisition, disposition, or use of assets 
 
ASSET MISAPPROPRIATIONS  
Potential asset misappropriation risks include misappropriation of: 
• Tangible assets 
• Intangible assets 
• Proprietary business opportunities 
 
CORRUPTION  
Potential corruption risks include: 
• Payment of bribes or gratuities to companies, private individuals, or public officials 
• Receipt of bribes, kickbacks, or gratuities 
• Aiding and abetting of fraud by outside parties, such as customers or vendors 
 
Certain other types of risks that can affect or be affected by each of the major areas of fraud 
risks include regulatory and legal misconduct, reputation risk, and risk to information 
technology (IT). 
 
REGULATORY AND LEGAL MISCONDUCT  
Regulatory and legal misconduct includes a wide range of risks, such as conflicts of interest, 
insider trading, theft of competitor trade secrets, anti-competitive practices, environmental 
violations, and trade and customs regulations in areas of import and export. Depending on 
the particular organization and the nature of its business, some or all of these risks may be 
applicable and should be considered in the fraud risk assessment process. 
 
REPUTATION RISK  
The fraud risk assessment team should ensure that consideration of reputation risk is part of 
the organization’s risk assessment process because fraudulent acts can damage an 
organization’s reputation with customers, suppliers, capital markets, and others. For 
example, fraud leading to a financial restatement can damage an organization’s reputation in 
capital markets, which can increase the organization’s cost of borrowing and depress its 
market capitalization. 
 
Fraud Risk Assessment  Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
4.816   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
RISK TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY  
Information technology (IT) is a critical component of fraud risk assessment. Organizations 
rely on IT to conduct business, communicate, and process financial information. A poorly 
designed or inadequately controlled IT environment can expose an organization to threats to 
data integrity, threats from hackers to system security, and theft of financial and sensitive 
business information. Whether in the form of hacking, economic espionage, Web 
defacement, sabotage of data, viruses, or unauthorized access to data, IT fraud risks can 
result in significant financial and information losses. 
 
Assess the Likelihood of Occurrence of the Identified Fraud Risks  
Assessing the likelihood and significance of each potential fraud risk is a subjective process 
that allows the organization to manage its fraud risks and apply preventive and detective 
controls rationally. The fraud risk assessment team should first consider fraud risks to the 
organization on an inherent basis, or without consideration of known controls. By 
approaching the assessment in this manner, the team will be better able to consider all 
relevant fraud risks and then evaluate and design controls to address the risks. 
 
The likelihood of occurrence of each fraud risk can be classified as remote, reasonably possible, 
or probable. The fraud risk assessment team should consider the following factors in assessing 
the likelihood of occurrence of each fraud risk: 
• Past instances of the particular fraud occurring at the organization 
• Prevalence of the fraud risk in the organization’s industry 
• Internal controls environment of the organization 
• Resources available to address fraud 
• Support of fraud prevention efforts by management 
• Ethical standards of the organization 
• Number of individual transactions involved 
• Complexity of the fraud risk 
• Number of people involved in reviewing or approving a relevant process 
• Unexplained losses 
• Complaints by customers or vendors 
• Information from fraud surveys such as ACFE’s Report to the Nations on Occupational Fraud 
and Abuse  
 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Fraud Risk Assessment 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.817 
Assess the Significance to the Organization of the Fraud Risks  
The fraud risk assessment team should consider qualitative and quantitative factors when 
assessing the fraud risks to the organization. For example, a particular fraud risk that might 
only pose an immaterial direct financial risk to the organization, but that could greatly impact 
its reputation, would be deemed a more significant risk to the organization. 
 
The significance of each potential fraud can be classified as immaterial, significant, or material. 
In assessing the significance of each fraud risk, the fraud risk assessment team should 
consider the following factors: 
• Financial statement and monetary significance 
• Financial condition of the organization 
• Value of the threatened assets 
• Criticality of the threatened assets to the organization 
• Revenue generated by the threatened assets 
• Significance to the organization’s operations, brand value, and reputation 
• Criminal, civil, and regulatory liabilities 
 
Evaluate Which People and Departments Are Most Likely to Commit Fraud and Identify the Methods They Are Likely to Use  
In identifying potential fraud risks, the risk assessment team will have evaluated the 
incentives and pressures on individuals and departments to commit fraud. The team should 
use the information gained in that process to identify the individuals and departments most 
likely to commit fraud and the methods they are likely to use. This knowledge will assist the 
organization in tailoring its fraud risk response, including establishing appropriate 
segregation of duties, proper review and approval chains of authority, and proactive fraud 
auditing procedures. 
 
Identify and Map Existing Preventive and Detective Controls to the Relevant Fraud Risks  
After identifying and assessing fraud risks for likelihood of occurrence and for significance, 
the fraud risk assessment team should identify and map existing preventive and detective 
controls to the relevant fraud risks. 
 
PREVENTIVE CONTROLS  
Preventive controls, which are intended to prevent fraud before it occurs, include: 
Fraud Risk Assessment  Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
4.818   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
• Bringing awareness to personnel throughout the organization of the fraud risk 
management program in place 
• Performing background checks on employees (where permitted by law) 
• Hiring competent personnel and providing them with anti-fraud training 
• Conducting exit interviews 
• Implementing policies and procedures 
• Segregating duties 
• Ensuring proper alignment between an individual’s authority and his level  
of responsibility 
• Reviewing third-party and related-party transactions 
 
DETECTIVE CONTROLS  
Detective controls, which are intended to detect fraud if it does occur, include: 
• Establishing and marketing the presence of a confidential reporting system, such as a 
whistleblower hotline 
• Implementing proactive fraud detection process controls, such as reconciliations, 
independent reviews, physical inspections/counts, analysis, and audits 
• Implementing proactive fraud detection procedures, such as data analysis, continuous 
auditing techniques, and other technology tools 
• Performing surprise audits 
 
Evaluate Whether the Identified Controls Are Operating Effectively and Efficiently  
The fraud risk assessment team must ensure that there are adequate controls in place, that 
the controls are mitigating fraud risk as intended, and that the benefit of the controls exceeds 
the cost. Such an assessment requires: 
• Review of the accounting policies and procedures in place 
• Consideration of the risk of management’s override of controls 
• Interviews with management and employees 
• Observation of control activities 
• Sample testing of controls compliance 
• Review of previous audit reports 
• Review of previous reports on fraud incidents, shrinkage, and unexplained shortages 
 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Fraud Risk Assessment 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.819 
Identify and Evaluate Residual Fraud Risks Resulting from Ineffective or Nonexistent Controls  
Consideration of the internal control structure may reveal certain residual fraud risks, 
including management’s override of established controls that has not been adequately 
mitigated due to: 
• Lack of appropriate prevention and detection controls 
• Noncompliance with established prevention and control measures 
 
These residual fraud risks should be evaluated by the fraud risk assessment team in the 
development of the fraud risk response for likelihood and significance of occurrence. 
 
Sample Fraud Risk Assessment Framework #2 — Fraud Risk Index  
The following is a suggested framework that has two components: the Fraud Risk Index, 
which looks at indicators of areas that put the organization at risk for fraud, and the 
Leadership Risk Profile, which examines the way business leaders operate to help determine 
if they behave or conduct business in a way that can increase the company’s risk of fraud. 
 
Fraud Risk Index  
The Fraud Risk Index is the overall assessment of fraud risk for the organization based on 
three components: 
• The Environmental Risk Index 
• The Culture Quotient 
• The Prevent/Detect Index 
 
THE ENVIRONMENTAL RISK INDEX  
The Environmental Risk Index is an assessment of macro-level fraud risk indicators that can 
affect the organization’s vulnerability to fraud. These include factors such as pressures on 
the business, the organization’s system of internal controls, the tone at the top, and the 
overall quality of the mechanisms that the company has in place to prevent and detect fraud.  
  
THE CULTURE QUOTIENT  
The Culture Quotient is an assessment of how the organization and its people behave or are 
perceived to behave. The Culture Quotient includes: 
• Tolerance Index — an assessment of the organi zation’s tolerance for bad behavior. An 
organization that has a high tolerance for bad behavior can significantly increase the 
company’s vulnerability to fraud risk. 
Fraud Risk Assessment  Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
4.820   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
• Entitlement Index — an assessment that helps determine whether people in the company 
display or promote a sense of entitlement. An organization that sustains a strong sense 
of entitlement from its employees or leaders can have a higher risk of fraud.  
• Notification Index — an assessment of how likely it is that employees will come forward 
when they suspect something is wrong. An organization where there is a low probability 
that employees will come forward is at significantly greater risk of fraud than an 
organization where it is likely that employees will come forward.  
 
Both the Environmental Risk Index and Culture Quotient are elements of the Fraud Risk 
Index that are aimed at identifying and evaluating macro-level indicators of fraud risk that 
the company may be exposed to. The content and approach for performing these parts of 
the assessment should be tailored for the organization under review. 
 
THE PREVENT/DETECT INDEX  
The Prevent/Detect Index assesses the quality of the specific mechanisms that the 
organization has in place to prevent or detect potential fraud, particularly those fraud 
schemes for which the company is at the greatest risk. This component of the assessment 
can be used to identify the company’s greatest fraud risks by pinpointing areas and methods 
that provide opportunities for potential fraudsters to get something—of either real or 
perceived value—out of the business. 
 
To calculate the Prevent/Detect Index, a standard, comprehensive population of fraud 
schemes, such as the ACFE Occupational Fraud Classification System, is used to evaluate 
each scheme that applies to the business and determine which schemes are the high-risk 
schemes that the organization should focus on. For those fraud schemes that apply to the 
company, an evaluation of each scheme should be performed to identify:  
• The likelihood that the scheme could be perpetrated 
• The significance of the fraud risk to the company  
• Whether there are preventive or detective internal controls in place to moderate the risk 
to a sufficient level  
 
Leadership Risk Profile  
The Leadership Risk Profile is developed to provide a macro-level organizational view of 
which business leaders, if any, increase the organization’s vulnerability to fraud through their:  
• Leadership style 
  
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Fraud Risk Assessment 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.821 
• Operating behaviors 
• Decision-making practices 
 
The fraud risk assessment team should develop or obtain an organizational chart that shows 
the organizational structure of the business and identifies its leaders. The team should then 
develop a profile of each of the leaders and evaluate the fraud risk associated with their 
leadership styles, operating behaviors (including how they interact with their team and 
partners across the business), and decision-making practices.  
 
As part of this evaluation, the team should consider any information that indicates unique 
pressures on or incentives for each leader that could increase the organization’s fraud risk. 
Such pressures and incentives can include, but are not limited to: 
• A significant amount of personal net worth invested in the company 
• A large portion of compensation tied to activities that the leader can manipulate (e.g., 
sales volumes or other business performance measures)  
• A pending divorce 
• Recent organizational changes that have either greatly expanded or reduced/eliminated 
the leader’s span of control 
• Living larger than life 
• Dependence on drugs or alcohol 
• Gambling problems 
 
Note that a comprehensive approach to conducting a fraud risk assessment using this 
framework would include the assessment of both the Fraud Risk Index and the Leadership 
Risk Profile. However, due to the sensitive nature of the Leadership Risk Profile, the 
sponsor may decide to focus the assessment on only the Fraud Risk Index.
