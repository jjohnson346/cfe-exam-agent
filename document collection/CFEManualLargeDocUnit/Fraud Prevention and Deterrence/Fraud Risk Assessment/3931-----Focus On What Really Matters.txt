Focus On What Really Matters  
Less is often more when it comes to reporting the results of the fraud risk assessment. The 
team should take care not to turn the report into a laundry list of things that management 
will have to sort through and prioritize. Instead, the report should be presented in a way that 
focuses on what really matters, clearly highlighting those things that are most important and 
that will make the most impact on the organization’s fraud risk management efforts.
