Reporting the Leadership Risk Assessment Results  
The results of the Leadership Risk Profile should  be treated with great sensitivity. The fraud 
risk assessment team should discuss with the sponsor what the best method would be for 
conveying the results of that work. If a formal report is requested, a color-coded 
organization chart can be used as quick visual to convey the fraud risk associated with each 
leadership area across the business.
