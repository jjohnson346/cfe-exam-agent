Transfer the Risk  
Management may transfer some or all of the risk by purchasing fidelity insurance or a bond. 
The cost to the organization is the premium paid for the insurance or bond. The covered 
risk of loss is then transferred to the insurance company, less any deductible payment 
included in the contract.
