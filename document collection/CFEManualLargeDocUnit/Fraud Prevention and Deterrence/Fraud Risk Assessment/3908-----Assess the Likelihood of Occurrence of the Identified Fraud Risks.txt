Fraud Risk Assessment


:


Assess the Likelihood of Occurrence of the Identified Fraud Risks  
Assessing the likelihood and significance of each potential fraud risk is a subjective process 
that allows the organization to manage its fraud risks and apply preventive and detective 
controls rationally. The fraud risk assessment team should first consider fraud risks to the 
organization on an inherent basis, or without consideration of known controls. By 
approaching the assessment in this manner, the team will be better able to consider all 
relevant fraud risks and then evaluate and design controls to address the risks. 
 
The likelihood of occurrence of each fraud risk can be classified as remote, reasonably possible, 
or probable. The fraud risk assessment team should consider the following factors in assessing 
the likelihood of occurrence of each fraud risk: 
• Past instances of the particular fraud occurring at the organization 
• Prevalence of the fraud risk in the organization’s industry 
• Internal controls environment of the organization 
• Resources available to address fraud 
• Support of fraud prevention efforts by management 
• Ethical standards of the organization 
• Number of individual transactions involved 
• Complexity of the fraud risk 
• Number of people involved in reviewing or approving a relevant process 
• Unexplained losses 
• Complaints by customers or vendors 
• Information from fraud surveys such as ACFE’s Report to the Nations on Occupational Fraud 
and Abuse
