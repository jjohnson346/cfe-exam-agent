Identify Potential Inherent Fraud Risks  
The fraud risk assessment team should brainstorm to identify the fraud risks that could apply 
to the organization. Brainstorming should include discussions regarding the following areas:

INCENTIVES, PRESSURES, AND OPPORTUNITIES TO COMMIT FRAUD  
When assessing incentives, pressures, and opportunities to commit fraud, the fraud risk 
assessment team should evaluate: 
• Incentive programs and how they may affect employees’ behavior when conducting 
business or applying professional judgment 
• Pressures on individuals to achieve performance or other targets and how such pressures 
may influence employees’ behavior 
• Opportunities to commit fraud that arise from weak internal controls, such as a lack of 
segregation of duties 
 
RISK OF MANAGEMENT’S OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS  
When considering the potential for management’s override of controls, the fraud risk 
assessment team should keep in mind that: 
• Management personnel within the organization generally know the controls and standard 
operating procedures that are in place to prevent fraud. 
• Individuals who are intent on committing fraud may use their knowledge of the 
organization’s controls to do it in a manner that will conceal their actions. 
 
POPULATION OF FRAUD RISKS  
The fraud risk identification process requires an understanding of the universe of fraud risks 
and the subset of risks that apply to a particular organization. It includes gathering 
information about the business itself, including its business processes, industry, and 
operating environment, as well as all associated potential fraud risks. Such information can 
be obtained from external sources—such as in dustry news outlets; criminal, civil, and 
regulatory complaints and settlements; and professional organizations and associations—and 
from internal sources by interviewing and brainstorming with personnel, reviewing 
complaints on the whistleblower hotline, and performing analytical procedures. 
 
Fraud risks can be classified into three major areas: fraudulent financial reporting, asset 
misappropriation, and corruption. Potential fraud risks to consider in each category are 
discussed below. 
 
FRAUDULENT FINANCIAL REPORTING  
Potential fraudulent financial reporting risks include: 
• Inappropriately reported revenues, expenses, or both 
• Inappropriately reflected balance sheet amounts, including reserves 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Fraud Risk Assessment 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.815 
• Inappropriately improved or masked disclosures 
• Concealed misappropriation of assets 
• Concealed unauthorized receipts, expenditures, or both 
• Concealed unauthorized acquisition, disposition, or use of assets 
 
ASSET MISAPPROPRIATIONS  
Potential asset misappropriation risks include misappropriation of: 
• Tangible assets 
• Intangible assets 
• Proprietary business opportunities 
 
CORRUPTION  
Potential corruption risks include: 
• Payment of bribes or gratuities to companies, private individuals, or public officials 
• Receipt of bribes, kickbacks, or gratuities 
• Aiding and abetting of fraud by outside parties, such as customers or vendors 
 
Certain other types of risks that can affect or be affected by each of the major areas of fraud 
risks include regulatory and legal misconduct, reputation risk, and risk to information 
technology (IT). 
 
REGULATORY AND LEGAL MISCONDUCT  
Regulatory and legal misconduct includes a wide range of risks, such as conflicts of interest, 
insider trading, theft of competitor trade secrets, anti-competitive practices, environmental 
violations, and trade and customs regulations in areas of import and export. Depending on 
the particular organization and the nature of its business, some or all of these risks may be 
applicable and should be considered in the fraud risk assessment process. 
 
REPUTATION RISK  
The fraud risk assessment team should ensure that consideration of reputation risk is part of 
the organization’s risk assessment process because fraudulent acts can damage an 
organization’s reputation with customers, suppliers, capital markets, and others. For 
example, fraud leading to a financial restatement can damage an organization’s reputation in 
capital markets, which can increase the organization’s cost of borrowing and depress its 
market capitalization.

RISK TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY  
Information technology (IT) is a critical component of fraud risk assessment. Organizations 
rely on IT to conduct business, communicate, and process financial information. A poorly 
designed or inadequately controlled IT environment can expose an organization to threats to 
data integrity, threats from hackers to system security, and theft of financial and sensitive 
business information. Whether in the form of hacking, economic espionage, Web 
defacement, sabotage of data, viruses, or unauthorized access to data, IT fraud risks can 
result in significant financial and information losses.
