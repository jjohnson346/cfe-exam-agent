Preparing the Company for a Fraud Risk Assessment  
Preparing the company for the fraud risk assessment is a critical element to ensuring its 
success. The culture of the organization should play a large role in influencing the approach 
taken to prepare the company for the fraud risk assessment. The goals of the preparation 
should be to:  
• Assemble the right team to lead and conduct the fraud risk assessment. 
• Determine the best techniques to use in conducting the fraud risk assessment.

• Obtain the sponsor’s agreement on the work to be performed. 
• Educate the organization and openly promote the process. 
 
Assemble the Right Team to Lead and Conduct the Fraud Risk Assessment  
Before conducting the fraud risk assessment, the organization should build a fraud  
risk assessment team consisting of individuals with diverse knowledge, skills, and 
perspectives that will lead and conduct the fraud risk assessment. The size of the team will 
depend on the size of the organization and the methods used to conduct the assessment. 
The team should have individuals who are credible and who have experience in gathering 
and eliciting information.  
 
The team members might include internal and external resources, such as: 
• Accounting and finance personnel who are familiar with the financial reporting 
processes and internal controls 
• Non-financial business unit and operations personnel who have knowledge of day-to-day 
operations, customer and vendor interactions, and issues within the industry 
• Risk management personnel who can ensure that the fraud risk assessment process 
integrates with the organization’s enterprise risk management program 
• The general counsel or other members of the legal department 
• Members of any ethics or compliance functions within the organization 
• Internal auditors 
• External consultants with fraud and risk expertise 
• Any business leader with direct accountability for the effectiveness of the organization’s 
fraud risk management efforts 
 
Determine the Best Techniques to Use to Conduct the Fraud Risk Assessment  
There are many ways to go about conducting the fraud risk assessment. Picking a method or 
combination of methods that is culturally right for the organization will help to ensure its 
success. The assessment team should also consider the best ways to gather candid, truthful 
information from people throughout all levels of the organization, starting by understanding 
what techniques are commonly and effectively used throughout the organization.  
 
Some examples of methods that can be used to conduct the fraud risk assessment are: 
• Interviews 
• Focus groups 
  
Fraud Risk Assessment  Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
4.810   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
• Surveys 
• Anonymous feedback mechanisms  
 
Interviews  
Interviews can be an effective way to conduct a candid one-on-one conversation. The 
usefulness of interviews as a technique will depend on how willing people in the organization 
are to be open and honest in a direct dialogue with the interviewer. The assessor must 
consider whether interviews are commonly and effectively used in the organization to gather 
and elicit information. He should also speak with individuals that have previously conducted 
interviews with employees to glean lessons learned. For each potential interviewee, the 
assessor should gauge how likely and willing he would be to be open and honest—some 
people may be good interview candidates, while others may need to be engaged through a 
different approach.  
 
Focus Groups  
Focus groups enable the assessor to observe the interactions of employees as they discuss a 
question or issue. Some topics may lend themselves to being discussed in an open forum in 
which people feel comfortable among their colleagues. Additionally, when discussing tough 
or thorny issues in a group, an anonymous, real-time voting tool can be an effective way of 
opening up a dialogue among the participants.  
 
The success of a focus group will be highly dependent on the skill of the facilitator. If focus 
groups are used as part of the fraud risk assessment, they should be led by an experienced 
facilitator whom the group will relate to and trust. Getting a group to open up and talk 
honestly can be very difficult. An experienced facilitator will be able to read the group and 
use techniques, such as group icebreakers, to make the session a success. 
 
Surveys  
Surveys can be anonymous or directly attributable to individuals. Sometimes people will 
share more openly when they feel protected behind a computer or paper questionnaire. In 
an organization where the culture is not one where people open up and freely talk, an 
anonymous survey can be a great way to get feedback. However, employees can be skeptical 
about the true anonymity of a survey, especially in organizations that use surveys to solicit 
feedback anonymously but send follow-up e-mails to individual delinquent respondents. If 
the assessor determines that an anonymous survey is an appropriate technique to use in the 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Fraud Risk Assessment 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.811 
fraud risk assessment, he should clearly and explicitly explain to employees how anonymity 
will be maintained.  
 
Anonymous Feedback Mechanisms  
In some organizations, anonymous suggestion boxes or similar mechanisms are used to 
encourage and solicit frequent employee feedback. In these companies, information 
pertaining to the fraud risk assessment can be requested in the same way. Additionally, use 
of an anonymous feedback mechanism can also be effective in an environment where people 
are less likely to be open and honest through other methods and techniques.  
 
One approach to effectively using the anonymous feedback technique involves establishing a 
question of the day that is prominently displayed above a collection box. An example 
question is: “If you thought fraud was occurring in the company, would you come forward? 
Why or why not?” 
 
Another approach involves using a table lineup of five to ten opaque boxes, each with a 
statement posted above it. Employees are provided with poker chips in two different colors 
and told that one color indicates “I agree” and one indicates “I disagree.” Employees are 
then encouraged to respond to each statement by putting a corresponding chip in each box 
to indicate their response. 
 
Obtain the Sponsor’s Agreement on the Work to Be Performed 
Before the fraud risk assessment procedures begin, the sponsor and the fraud risk 
assessment team need to agree on: 
• The scope of work that will be performed 
• The methods that will be used to conduct the work (e.g., surveys, interviews, focus 
groups, anonymous feedback mechanisms) 
• The individuals who will participate in the chosen methods 
• The content of the chosen methods  
• The form of output for the assessment 
 
Educate the Organization and Openly Promote the Process  
The fraud risk assessment process should be visible and communicated throughout the 
business. Employees will be more inclined to participate in the process if they understand 
why it is being done and what the expected outcomes will be.  
 
Fraud Risk Assessment  Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
4.812   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
Sponsors should be strongly encouraged to openly promote the process. The more 
personalized the communication from the sponsor, the more effective it will be in 
encouraging employees to participate in the process. Whether it is a video, a town hall 
meeting, or a companywide e-mail, the communication should be aimed at eliminating any 
reluctance employees have about participating in the fraud risk assessment process.
