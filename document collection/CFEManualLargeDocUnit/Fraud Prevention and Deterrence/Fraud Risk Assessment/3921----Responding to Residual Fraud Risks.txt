Responding to Residual Fraud Risks 
Regardless of the framework used to conduct the fraud risk assessment, management will 
need to address the identified risks. Larry Cook, CFE, who is the principal author of the 
ACFE Fraud Risk Assessment Tool, suggests that management can use one or a 
combination of the following approaches to respond to the organization’s residual  
fraud risks: 
• Avoid the risk 
• Transfer the risk

• Mitigate the risk 
• Assume the risk 
 
Avoid the Risk  
Management may decide to avoid the risk by eliminating an asset or exiting an activity if the 
control measures required to protect the organization against an identified threat are too 
expensive. This approach requires the fraud risk assessment team to complete a cost-benefit 
analysis of the value of the asset or activity to the organization compared to the cost of 
implementing measures to protect the asset or activity. 
 
Transfer the Risk  
Management may transfer some or all of the risk by purchasing fidelity insurance or a bond. 
The cost to the organization is the premium paid for the insurance or bond. The covered 
risk of loss is then transferred to the insurance company, less any deductible payment 
included in the contract. 
 
Mitigate the Risk  
Management can help mitigate the risk by implementing appropriate countermeasures, such 
as prevention and detection controls. The fraud risk assessment team should evaluate each 
countermeasure to determine if it is cost effective and reasonable given the probability of 
occurrence and impact of loss. 
 
Assume the Risk  
Management may choose to assume the risk if it determines that the probability of 
occurrence and impact of loss are low. Management may decide that it is more cost effective 
to assume the risk than it is to eliminate the asset or exit the activity, buy insurance to 
transfer the risk, or implement countermeasures to mitigate the risk. 
 
Combination Approach  
Management may also elect a combination of the above approaches. For example, if the 
probability of occurrence and impact of loss are high, management may decide to transfer 
part of the risk through the purchase of insurance, as well as implement preventive and 
detective controls to mitigate the risk.
