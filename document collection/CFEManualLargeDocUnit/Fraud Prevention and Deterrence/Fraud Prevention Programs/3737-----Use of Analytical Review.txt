Use of Analytical Review 
Much internal fraud is discovered as a result of analytical review. To uncover such fraud and 
defalcations, they must materially impact the financial statements. Auditors should be 
especially mindful of the following trends: 
• Increasing expenses 
• Increasing cost of sales 
• Increasing receivables/decreasing cash 
• Increasing inventories 
• Increasing sales/decreasing cash 
• Increasing returns and allowances 
• Increasing sales discounts
