Legal Considerations 
Many companies have learned that it is best to spell out specific unacceptable conduct. If the 
type of conduct that is considered unacceptable is not accurately detailed, there might be 
legal problems in discharging a dishonest employee. Check with your counsel regarding any 
legal considerations with respect to a fraud policy. One of the most important legal 
considerations is to ensure everyone and every allegation is handled in a uniform manner. A 
sample fraud policy is contained at the end of the chapter.
