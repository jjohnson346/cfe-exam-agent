Compliance with Laws and Regulatory Orders 
The applicable laws and regulatory orders of every jurisdiction in which the company 
operates must be followed. Each employee is charged with the responsibility of acquiring 
sufficient knowledge of the laws and orders relating to his duties in order to recognize 
potential dangers and to know when to seek legal advice. 
 
In particular, when dealing with public officials, employees must adhere to the highest ethical 
standards of business conduct. When we seek the resolution of regulatory or political issues 
affecting the company’s interests, we must do so solely on the basis of merit and pursuant to 
proper procedures in dealing with such officials. Employees may not offer, provide, or 
solicit, directly or indirectly, any special treatment or favor in return for anything of 
economic value or the promise or expectation of future value or gain. In addition, there shall 
be no entertaining of employees of the U.S. Government.
