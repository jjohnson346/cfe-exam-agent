The Treadway Commission 
The National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting (commonly known as the 
Treadway Commission) was established in 1987 with the purpose of defining the 
responsibility of the auditor in preventing and detecting fraud. The commission was formed 
by the major professional auditing organizations—the American Institute of CPAs, the 
Institute of Internal Auditors, and the National Association of Accountants. The Treadway 
Commission made several major recommendations that, in combination with other 
measures, are designed to reduce the probability of fraud in financial reports: 
• A mandatory independent audit committee  made up of outside directors 
• A written charter that sets forth the duties and responsibilities of the audit committee  
• The audit committee should have adequate resources and authority  to carry out its 
responsibilities 
• The audit committee should be informed, vigilant, and effective
