Gifts and Entertainment 
DEFINITION OF GIFTS 
Gifts are items and services of value that are given to any outside parties, but do not include 
items described below. 
• Normal business entertainment items, such as meals and beverages, are not to be 
considered gifts. 
• Items of minimal value, given in connection with sales campaigns and promotions or 
employee service, safety, or retirement awards are not to be considered gifts for purposes 
of this code. 
• Contributions or donations to recognized charitable and nonprofit organizations are not 
considered gifts. 
• Items or services with a total value under $100 per year are excluded. 
 
DEFINITION OF SUPPLIER 
“Supplier” includes not only vendors providin g services and material to the company, but 
also consultants, financial institutions, advisors, and any person or institution that does 
business with the company. 
 
GIFTS  
No employee or member of his immediate family shall solicit or accept from an actual or 
prospective customer or supplier any compensation, advance loans (except from established 
financial institutions on the same basis as other customers), gifts, entertainment, or other 
favors that are of more than token value or that the employee would not normally be in a 
position to reciprocate under normal expense account procedures. 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Fraud Prevention Programs 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   4.757 
Under no circumstances should a gift or entertainment be accepted that would influence the 
employee’s judgment. In particular, employees must avoid any interest in or benefit from any 
supplier that could reasonably cause them to favor that supplier over others. It is a violation 
of the code for any employee to solicit or encourage a supplier to give any item or service to 
the employee regardless of its value, no matter how small. Our suppliers will retain their 
confidence in the objectivity and integrity of our company only if each employee strictly 
observes this guideline. 
 
REPORTING GIFTS  
An employee who receives, or whose family member receives, an unsolicited gift  
prohibited by these guidelines should report it to his supervisor and either return it to  
the person making the gift or, in the case of a perishable gift, give it to a nonprofit  
charitable organization.  
 
DISCOUNTS 
An employee might accept discounts on a personal purchase of the supplier’s or customer’s 
products only if such discounts do not affect the company’s purchase price and are generally 
offered to others having a similar business relationship with the supplier or customer.  
 
BUSINESS MEETINGS  
Entertainment and services offered by a supplier or customer may be accepted by an 
employee when they are associated with a business meeting and the supplier or customer 
provides them to others as a normal part of its business. Examples of such entertainment 
and services are transportation to and from the supplier’s or customer’s place of business, 
hospitality suites, golf outings, lodging at the supplier’s or customer’s place of business, and 
business lunches and dinners for business visitors to the supplier’s or customer’s location. 
The services should generally be of the type normally used by the company’s employees and 
allowable under the applicable company’s expense account.
