Codes of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers 
In order to have an effective anti-fraud program, organizations must set clear standards for 
conduct; it is also critical to establish an ethical tone at the top of an organization to serve as 
a guide and example for employees. Sarbanes-Oxley addresses both of these issues by 
requiring publicly traded companies to disclose in their periodic reports whether they have 
adopted a code of ethics for their senior financial officers, and if not, to explain their 
reasoning. SOX also requires companies to make an immediate disclosure any time there is a 
change in the code of ethics or a waiver for a senior financial officer.
