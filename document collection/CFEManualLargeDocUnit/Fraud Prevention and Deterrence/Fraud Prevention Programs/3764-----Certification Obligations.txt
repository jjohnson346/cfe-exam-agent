Certification Obligations 
As part of an effort to eliminate financial statement fraud, Sarbanes-Oxley requires CEOs 
and CFOs of publicly traded companies to personally certify their companies’ annual and 
quarterly SEC filings. There are two categories of officer certifications required by SOX: 
criminal certifications, which are contained in Section 906 of the Act, and civil certifications, 
which are contained in Section 302.  
 
CRIMINAL CERTIFICATIONS 
Under Section 906, all periodic filings with the SEC must be accompanied by a statement 
which certifies that the report fully complies with the SEC’s reporting requirements and that 
the information in the report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition 
and results of operation of the company. This statement must be signed by both the CEO 
and CFO. These certifications are known as  “criminal certifications” because the Act 
imposes criminal penalties for violations of this Section, including fines of up to $1 million 
and imprisonment of up to ten years.  
 
CIVIL CERTIFICATIONS 
Section 302 requires that the CEO and CFO certify  the following six items in every annual 
and quarterly report: 
• They have personally reviewed the report.

• Based on their knowledge, the report does not contain any material misstatement that 
would render the financials misleading. 
• Based on their knowledge, the financial information in the report fairly presents  in  
all material respects the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow of  
the company.  
• They are responsible for designing, maintaining, and evaluating the company’s  
internal controls; they have designed the controls to ensure that they receive material 
information about the company; they have evaluated the controls within 90 days prior to 
the report; and they have presented their conclusions about the effectiveness of the 
controls in the report. 
• They have disclosed to the auditors and the audit committee any material weaknesses in 
the controls and any fraud, whether material or not, that involves management or other 
employees who have a significant role in the company’s internal controls.  
• They have indicated in the report whether there have been significant changes in the 
company’s internal controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant 
deficiencies and material weaknesses. 
 
IMPACT OF CERTIFICATION OBLIGATIONS 
Sarbanes-Oxley requires CEOs and CFOs to  take personal responsibility for their 
companies’ financial statements; they cannot  delegate their responsibilities to their 
subordinates and then claim ignorance when fraud is discovered. If the financials include 
fraudulent reporting, then the senior financial officers may be held individually civilly liable 
for the misstatements.  
 
The “fairly presents” standard of item 3 is broader than what is required by GAAP. It 
essentially requires the CEO and CFO to certi fy that the company has selected appropriate 
accounting policies; has properly applied those accounting standards; and has disclosed 
financial information that reflects the underlying transactions of the company.  
 
Item 4 requires senior financial officers to take an active role in the design and maintenance 
of their companies’ internal controls. It not only requires the CEO and CFO to certify that 
they are responsible for controls, but also that they have evaluated their controls within 90 
days prior to their quarterly or annual report. This effectively requires companies to 
continually re-evaluate their control structures. Item 5 requires the CEO and CFO to report 
any material weaknesses in their company’s controls, along with any fraud involving 
management, whether it is material or not.

The overall effect of these certification requirements is to force CEOs and CFOs to take an 
active role in the anti-fraud efforts of their companies, making internal controls and fraud 
prevention a high priority.
