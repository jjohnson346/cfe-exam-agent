Fraud Prevention Standards Under Sarbanes-Oxley 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) set forth a number  of preventive measures public companies 
must take to help reduce the threat of fraud. The Act as a whole is discussed in detail in the 
Law section of the Fraud Examiners Manual. Here, we will cover only the portions of SOX 
that directly relate to fraud prevention.  
 
Audit Committee Responsibilities 
One of the keys to effective fraud prevention is assigning high-level personnel responsibility 
for fraud prevention efforts. This signals to employees that fraud is a serious matter and it 
helps ensure that fraud prevention issues will receive consideration at the highest levels of 
the company. SOX mandates that audit committees for publicly traded companies be 
directly responsible for two key components of an effective fraud prevention program—
 outside audits and internal reporting mechanisms. It also establishes requirements for the 
composition of audit committees to ensure that they are capable of carrying out  
their duties.  
 
Overseeing Audits 
Section 301 of the Act requires the audit committee for every publicly traded company to be 
directly responsible for hiring, paying, and overseeing the work of the company’s outside 
auditors. Auditors must report directly to the audit committee, and the committee is 
responsible for resolving disputes between auditors and the company’s management. 
 
Section 204 of SOX requires outside auditors to report certain information to the audit 
committee, including any alternative accounting treatments within GAAP that have been 
Fraud Prevention Programs  Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
4.724   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
discussed with management, the effect of using those alternative treatments, and the 
treatment preferred by the auditors. This is designed to give the audit committee a warning 
in the event that management has used questionable or overly aggressive accounting in the 
preparation of the company’s financial statements. 
 
Receiving Complaints 
Section 301 also specifies that audit committees must establish procedures for receiving and 
dealing with complaints and anonymous employee tips regarding irregularities in the 
company’s accounting methods, internal controls, or auditing matters.  
 
Composition of the Audit Committee 
The Act also sets forth certain requirements regarding the composition of audit committees. 
Under Section 301, every member of the audit committee must also be a member of the 
company’s board of directors, which ensures that the committee will have sufficient 
authority within the company to carry out its duties. Furthermore, Section 407 of the Act 
requires every public company to disclose in its SEC reports whether at least one member of 
the audit committee is a “financial expert,” and if  not, to explain the reasons why. Financial 
experts are defined by SOX as persons who, through education and professional experience, 
possess the following: (1) an understanding of generally accepted accounting principles and 
financial statements; (2) experience in prepar ing or auditing financial statements of 
comparable companies and in accounting for estimates, accruals, and reserves in those 
companies; (3) experience with internal controls; and (4) an understanding of audit 
committee functions.  
 
Finally, Section 301 expressly states that audit committees must be given sufficient authority 
and funding to hire attorneys and other advisors necessary to carry out their duties. 
 
Management Responsibilities  
Sarbanes-Oxley also places a number of requirements on manag ement related to fraud 
prevention. It makes management directly responsible for internal controls, requires 
companies to establish codes of ethics for their senior financial officers, and requires CEOs 
and CFOs to personally certify their companies’ financial reports.  
 
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Controls 
Internal controls are among the most important aspects of any fraud prevention program. 
Section 404 of SOX requires each annual report filed with the SEC to contain an internal 
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Fraud Prevention Programs 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    4.725  
control report that (1) states management’s re sponsibility for establishing and maintaining an 
adequate internal control structure and (2) contains an assessment of the effectiveness of the 
internal control structure and procedures of the company for financial reporting. 
Management’s internal control assessment must be attested to and reported on by the 
company’s outside auditors.  
 
Codes of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers 
In order to have an effective anti-fraud program, organizations must set clear standards for 
conduct; it is also critical to establish an ethical tone at the top of an organization to serve as 
a guide and example for employees. Sarbanes-Oxley addresses both of these issues by 
requiring publicly traded companies to disclose in their periodic reports whether they have 
adopted a code of ethics for their senior financial officers, and if not, to explain their 
reasoning. SOX also requires companies to make an immediate disclosure any time there is a 
change in the code of ethics or a waiver for a senior financial officer.  
 
Certification Obligations 
As part of an effort to eliminate financial statement fraud, Sarbanes-Oxley requires CEOs 
and CFOs of publicly traded companies to personally certify their companies’ annual and 
quarterly SEC filings. There are two categories of officer certifications required by SOX: 
criminal certifications, which are contained in Section 906 of the Act, and civil certifications, 
which are contained in Section 302.  
 
CRIMINAL CERTIFICATIONS 
Under Section 906, all periodic filings with the SEC must be accompanied by a statement 
which certifies that the report fully complies with the SEC’s reporting requirements and that 
the information in the report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition 
and results of operation of the company. This statement must be signed by both the CEO 
and CFO. These certifications are known as  “criminal certifications” because the Act 
imposes criminal penalties for violations of this Section, including fines of up to $1 million 
and imprisonment of up to ten years.  
 
CIVIL CERTIFICATIONS 
Section 302 requires that the CEO and CFO certify  the following six items in every annual 
and quarterly report: 
• They have personally reviewed the report. 
Fraud Prevention Programs  Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
4.726   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual     
• Based on their knowledge, the report does not contain any material misstatement that 
would render the financials misleading. 
• Based on their knowledge, the financial information in the report fairly presents  in  
all material respects the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow of  
the company.  
• They are responsible for designing, maintaining, and evaluating the company’s  
internal controls; they have designed the controls to ensure that they receive material 
information about the company; they have evaluated the controls within 90 days prior to 
the report; and they have presented their conclusions about the effectiveness of the 
controls in the report. 
• They have disclosed to the auditors and the audit committee any material weaknesses in 
the controls and any fraud, whether material or not, that involves management or other 
employees who have a significant role in the company’s internal controls.  
• They have indicated in the report whether there have been significant changes in the 
company’s internal controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant 
deficiencies and material weaknesses. 
 
IMPACT OF CERTIFICATION OBLIGATIONS 
Sarbanes-Oxley requires CEOs and CFOs to  take personal responsibility for their 
companies’ financial statements; they cannot  delegate their responsibilities to their 
subordinates and then claim ignorance when fraud is discovered. If the financials include 
fraudulent reporting, then the senior financial officers may be held individually civilly liable 
for the misstatements.  
 
The “fairly presents” standard of item 3 is broader than what is required by GAAP. It 
essentially requires the CEO and CFO to certi fy that the company has selected appropriate 
accounting policies; has properly applied those accounting standards; and has disclosed 
financial information that reflects the underlying transactions of the company.  
 
Item 4 requires senior financial officers to take an active role in the design and maintenance 
of their companies’ internal controls. It not only requires the CEO and CFO to certify that 
they are responsible for controls, but also that they have evaluated their controls within 90 
days prior to their quarterly or annual report. This effectively requires companies to 
continually re-evaluate their control structures. Item 5 requires the CEO and CFO to report 
any material weaknesses in their company’s controls, along with any fraud involving 
management, whether it is material or not.  
Fraud Prevention and Deterrence  Fraud Prevention Programs 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    4.727  
The overall effect of these certification requirements is to force CEOs and CFOs to take an 
active role in the anti-fraud efforts of their companies, making internal controls and fraud 
prevention a high priority.  
 
Whistleblower Protection 
A key to any fraud prevention program is the establishment of a mechanism by which fraud 
can be reported. As was stated above, Section 301 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires audit 
committees to establish mechanisms for receiving complaints about irregularities in a 
company’s accounting, auditing, or internal control systems.  
 
In order to protect those who make such reports, SOX established broad protections for 
corporate whistleblowers. Section 806 of the Act creates civil liability for publicly traded 
companies that retaliate against employees who provide information or assist in the 
investigation of securities fraud. Penalties for violating this Section include reinstatement, 
back pay with interest, and compensation for special damages such as litigation costs and 
attorney’s fees. 
 
Section 1107 makes it a crime to retaliate against a person for providing truthful information 
relating to the commission or possible commission of any federal offense. This Section 
offers much broader protection than the civil whistleblower protection afforded under 
Section 806. The whistleblower protections under Section 1107 cover all individuals, not just 
employees of publicly traded companies. They also protect individuals who provide 
information about any federal offense, not just securities fraud. Vi olations of Section 1107 are 
punishable by fines of up to $250,000 and up to ten years in prison for individuals. 
Corporations can be fined up to $500,000.  
 
Fraud Prevention Requirements for External Auditors  
Attesting to Internal Controls 
As was stated above, Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires a company’s auditors to attest 
to and report on management’s assessment of in ternal controls in each annual report filed 
with the SEC. In addition, each audit report must describe the scope of the auditor’s testing 
of the company’s internal control structure. The audit report must include an evaluation of 
whether the company’s internal controls are acceptable and a description of material 
weaknesses in the control structure or any material noncompliance with controls.

Restrictions on Non-Audit Activity 
In order to address concerns about potential conflicts of interest that can arise when public 
accounting firms receive consulting fees and other compensation for non-audit services 
from their audit clients, Sarbanes-Oxley established a list of activities that public accounting 
firms are now prohibited from performing on behalf of their audit clients. The list includes 
most consulting and expert services, although tax services are still permissible if they are 
approved in advance by the audit committee.
