Fraud Policy Objectives 
A fraud prevention program will entail objectives very similar to those of internal control. 
According to the Institute of Internal Auditors’ Standards for the Professional Practice of 
Internal Auditing, the primary objectives for management to achieve proper internal controls 
include reasonable assurance that: 
• Financial and operating information is accurate and reliable. 
• Policies, procedures, plans, laws, and regulations are complied with. 
• Assets are safeguarded against loss and theft. 
• Resources are used economically and efficiently. 
• Established program/operating goals and objectives are met. 
 
A fraud prevention policy with the above-mentioned goals is the first step toward effective 
fraud deterrence.
