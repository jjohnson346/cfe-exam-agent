Audit Committee Responsibilities 
One of the keys to effective fraud prevention is assigning high-level personnel responsibility 
for fraud prevention efforts. This signals to employees that fraud is a serious matter and it 
helps ensure that fraud prevention issues will receive consideration at the highest levels of 
the company. SOX mandates that audit committees for publicly traded companies be 
directly responsible for two key components of an effective fraud prevention program—
 outside audits and internal reporting mechanisms. It also establishes requirements for the 
composition of audit committees to ensure that they are capable of carrying out  
their duties.
