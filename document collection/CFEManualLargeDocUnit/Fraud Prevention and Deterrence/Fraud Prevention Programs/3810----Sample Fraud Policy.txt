Sample Fraud Policy
 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
The corporate fraud policy is established to facilitate the development 
of controls that will aid in the detection and prevention of fraud 
against ABC Corporation. It is the intent of ABC Corporation to 
promote consistent organizational behavior by providing guidelines 
and assigning responsibility for the development of controls and the 
conduct of investigations. 
 
 
SCOPE OF POLICY 
 
This policy applies to any irregularity, or suspected irregularity, 
involving employees, as well as shareholders, consultants, vendors, 
contractors, outside agencies doing business with employees of such 
agencies, and/or any other parties with a business relationship with 
ABC Corporation (also called the Company). 
 
Any investigative activity required will be conducted without regard 
to the suspected wrongdoer’s length of service, position/title, or 
relationship to the Company. 
 
 
POLICY 
 
Management is responsible for the detection and prevention of fraud, 
misappropriations, and other irregularities. Fraud is defined as the 
intentional, false representation or concealment of a material fact for 
the purpose of inducing another to act upon it to his injury. Each 
member of the management team will be familiar with the types of 
improprieties that might occur within his area of responsibility, and 
be alert for any indication of irregularity. 
 
Any irregularity that is detected or suspected must be reported 
immediately to the Director of ______ _ __ _ _ __, who coordinates all 
investigations with the Legal Department and other affected areas, 
both internal and external.

related to any suspected fraudulent act (see REPORTING 
PROCEDURES section below).

such items or facilities when it is within the scope of their 
investigation

 eties or irregularities so as to avoid mistaken accusations or alerting 
suspected individuals that an investigation is under way.

complainant may remain anonymous. All inquiries concerning the 
activity under investigation from the suspected individual, his 
attorney or representative, or any other inquirer should be directed 
to the Investigations Unit or the Legal Department. No information 
concerning the status of an investigation will be given out. The

this matter.” Under no circumstances  should any reference be made to 
“the allegation,” “the crime,” “t he fraud,” “the forgery,” “the 
misappropriation,” or any other specific reference.  
 
The reporting individual should be informed of the following:
