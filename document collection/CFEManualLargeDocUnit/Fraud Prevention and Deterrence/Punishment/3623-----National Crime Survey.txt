National Crime Survey 
The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is a statistical study carried out by the 
Bureau of the Census that annually conducts interviews with 51,000 individuals about 
experiences of crime victimization. It shows UCR seriously underreporting; that is, the 
persons interviewed report a much greater amount of crime than that which figures in the 
UCR reports. About 55 percent of crimes of violence and one-quarter of thefts are found to 
be reported to the police. The NCS makes no attempt to measure any behaviors that would 
fit into the category of white-collar crime. 
 
The UCR results show that crime victims and offenders share the same demographic 
characteristics. The average victim is young, male, uneducated, and poor. A somewhat 
counterintuitive result is that as wealth increases, the likelihood of being a victim of violence 
or burglary decreases. However, wealth is correlated positively with victimization by personal 
theft and larceny.
