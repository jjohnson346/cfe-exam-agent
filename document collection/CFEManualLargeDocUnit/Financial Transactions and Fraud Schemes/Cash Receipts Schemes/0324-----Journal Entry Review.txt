Journal Entry Review 
Skimming can sometimes be detected by reviewing and analyzing all journal entries made to 
the cash and inventory accounts. Journal entries involving the following topics should be 
examined: 
• False credits to inventory to conceal unrecorded or understated sales. 
• Write-offs of lost, stolen, or obsolete inventory. 
• Write-offs of accounts receivable accounts. 
• Irregular entries to cash accounts.
