Poor Collection Procedures 
Poor collection and recording procedures can make it easy for an employee to skim sales or 
receivables.  
 
EXAMPLE 
A governmental authority that dealt with public housing was victimized because it failed to 
itemize daily receipts. This agency received pa yments from several public housing tenants, 
but at the end of the day, “money” received from tenants was listed as a whole. Receipt

pinpoint which tenant had paid how much. Consequently, the employee in charge of

collecting money from tenants was able to skim a portion of their payments. She simply did 
not record the receipt of over $10,000. Her actions caused certain accounts receivable to be 
overstated where tenant payments were not properly recorded.
