Deposits in Transit 
A final strategy used to conceal stolen deposits is to carry the missing money as deposits in 
transit, which are a way of accounting for discrepancies between the company’s records and 
the bank statement.  
 
EXAMPLE 
An employee was responsible for receiving collections, issuing receipts, posting transactions, 
reconciling accounts, and making deposits. This employee took over $20,000 in collections 
from her employer over a five-month period. To hide her theft, the perpetrator carried the 
missing money as deposits in transit, meaning that the missing money would appear on the 
next month’s bank statement. Of course, it never did. The balance was carried for several 
months as “d.i.t.” until an auditor recognized the discrepancy and put a halt to the fraud.
