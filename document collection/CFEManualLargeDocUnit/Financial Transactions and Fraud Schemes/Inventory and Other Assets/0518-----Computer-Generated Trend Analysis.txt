Computer-Generated Trend Analysis

example, in a lumberyard operation, the computer can be programmed to list all purchases 
of four by four cedar fence posts eight feet in length. Examine all the source documents that 
are represented by the listing. By examining the source documents for each of these 
purchases, the examiner can plot trends to determine the occurrence of the following (or 
other) patterns:
