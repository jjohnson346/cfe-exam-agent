Legislation and Best Practices 
An organization’s board of directors and senior management generally set the code of 
conduct for the company. This code of conduct is often referred to as the company’s “ethic” 
and is the standard by which all employees are expected to conduct themselves. If the 
company’s ethic is one of high integrity, it is anticipated that the employees will tend to be 
more honest. If, on the other hand, the ethic is one of corruption, the employees will view it 
as a license to be corrupt. “Ethical leadership has to come from inside, and from the top. 
Ethical considerations have got to be on senior management’s agenda. And they have to set 
the tone by example, not by sending memos,” says J. Gregory Dees, a professor at Harvard 
Business School. 
 
An unimpeachable company ethic does not, in and of itself, ensure that financial statement 
fraud will not occur. Other measures are required for management to discharge its 
responsibilities to prevent and detect fraudulent financial reporting. 
 
The Treadway Commission 
The National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting, more commonly referred to 
as the Treadway Commission, was formed in the United States in 1985 to better define the 
responsibilities of the auditor in detecting and preventing fraud. The professional auditing 
organizations — the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, The Institute of 
Internal Auditors, and the American Accounting Association, among others — established 
the Treadway Commission to underwrite a study and make recommendations. In an effort 
to curb fraudulent financial reporting, the Treadway Commission offered four 
recommendations that, when combined with other measures, might help reduce the 
probability of fraudulent financial reporting. These recommendations are addressed to the 
board of directors’ audit committee.

Mandatory Independent Audit Committee 
The board of directors oversees the conduct of management. The Treadway Commission 
recommended that each board of directors have an audit committee composed of outside 
directors. 
 
Written Charter 
The Treadway Commission also suggested that companies develop a written charter setting 
forth the duties and responsibilities of the audit committee. The board of directors should 
periodically review, modify, and approve this written charter. 
 
Resources and Authority 
According to the Treadway Commission, the existence of an audit committee and a written 
charter is not enough. The committee also must have adequate resources and authority to 
carry out its responsibilities. 
 
Informed, Vigilant, and Effective Audit Committees 
The audit committee should be composed of members who are informed, vigilant, and 
effective. 
 
The COSO Report 
In addition, in 1987, the Treadway Commission recommended that management of publicly 
held companies include with its management reports an acknowledgement of responsibility 
for internal controls and an assessment of its effectiveness in meeting those controls. The 
Treadway Commission formed the Committee on Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) to 
actualize its recommendations. In 1992, COSO issued Internal Control—Integrated Framework  
(followed by an addendum), which provided the following definition: 
 
Internal Control is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
achievement of objectives in the following categories:  
a)  reliability of financial reporting,  
b)  effectiveness and efficiency  of operations, and  
c) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
 
COSO also identified, for management, five interrelated components of internal control: 
  
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.203 
• The control environment  sets the tone of an organization, influencing the control 
consciousness of the organization and providing a foundation for all other control 
components. 
• Risk assessment  is an entity’s identification and assessment of risks relevant to achieving 
control objectives. 
• Control activities  are an entity’s control policies and procedures. 
• Information and communication  is the exchange of information in a way that allows 
employees to carry out their responsibilities. 
• Monitoring  is the process that assesses the control environment over time.  
 
These components combined form an integrated system of controls. 
 
COSO Guidance for Smaller Public Companies 
In 2006, COSO issued a report titled Internal Control over Financial Reporting— Guidance for 
Smaller Public Companies, which provides guidance for small companies on implementing cost-
 effective internal controls over financial reporting as required under Sarbanes-Oxley Section 
404. While acknowledging that smaller public companies often face unique and 
disproportionate challenges in applying sound internal control practices, COSO noted that 
the benefits of good internal control outweigh the costs and add significant value to an 
organization. The guidance is split between three volumes and contains 20 principles related 
to the Internal Control—Integrated Framework, as well as 75 attributes related to these principles.  
 
The report outlines several methods small companies can utilize to establish and enhance 
cost-effective internal controls, such as widening and directing control from the top, 
emphasizing effective oversight on the part of the board of directors, compensating for 
limited segregation of duties, leveraging the abilities of commercially available information 
technology, and using management’s monitoring activities to offset shortcomings in other 
control areas. The report also discusses ways to achieve further efficiencies in designing, 
implementing, and assessing controls, including focusing on risk, adjusting documentation 
policies to fit the needs of the organization, and viewing internal control as an integrated 
process.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
On July 30, 2002, President Bush signed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This law significantly 
changed the laws of corporate governance and the rules and regulations under which 
accounting firms and corporations must operate. Additionally, certain provisions 
considerably increased the responsibilities of management and the accounting profession 
with regard to fraud. Since the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) has issued numerous SEC Releases that support and expand the Act’s 
requirements. Below is a summary of some of the most important provisions of Sarbanes-
 Oxley and the corresponding SEC rules that re late to fraud detection and prevention. More 
information about Sarbanes-Oxley can be found in the chapter entitled “The Law Related to 
Fraud” in the Law section of the Fraud Examiners  Manual. 
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed in July 2010, 
allows small public companies (those with less than $75 million in market cap) a permanent 
exemption from section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
Title I of Sarbanes-Oxley establishes the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(PCAOB), whose purpose is: 
 
“to oversee the audit of public companies that are subject to the securities laws, and 
related matters, in order to protect the inte rests of investors and further the public 
interest in the preparation of informative,  accurate, and independent audit reports for 
companies the securities of which are sold to, and held by and for, public investors.”  
[Section 101] 
 
In short, the Board is charged with overseeing public company audits, setting audit 
standards, and investigating acts of noncompliance by auditors or audit firms. The Board is 
appointed and overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is made up of five 
persons, two who are or have been Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) and three who have 
never been CPAs. The Act lists the Board’s duties, which include: 
• Registering public accounting firms that audit publicly traded companies. 
• Establishing or adopting auditing, quality control, ethics, independence, and other 
standards relating to audits of publicly traded companies. 
• Inspecting registered public accounting firms. 
• Investigating registered public accounting firms and their employees, conducting 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.205 
disciplinary hearings, and imposing sanctions where justified. 
• Performing such other duties as are necessary to promote high professional standards 
among registered accounting firms, to improve the quality of audit services offered by 
those firms, and to protect investors. 
• Enforcing compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the rules of the Board, professional 
standards, and securities laws relating to public company audits. 
 
Registration with the Board 
Public accounting firms must register with the PCAOB in order to legally prepare or issue an 
audit report on a publicly traded company. In order to become registered, accounting firms 
must disclose, among other things, the names of all public companies they audited in the 
preceding year, the names of all public companies they expect to audit in the current year, 
and the annual fees they received from each of their public audit clients for audit, 
accounting, and non-audit services.  
 
Auditing, Quality Control, and Independence Standards and Rules 
Section 103 of the Act requires the Board to establish standards for auditing, quality control, 
ethics, independence, and other issues relating to audits of publicly traded companies. 
Although the Act places the responsibility on the Board to establish audit standards, it also 
sets forth certain rules that the Board is required to include in those auditing standards. 
These rules include the following:  
• Audit work papers must be maintained for at least seven years. 
• Auditing firms must include a concurring or second partner review and approval of audit 
reports, and concurring approval in the issuance of the audit report by a qualified person 
other than the person in charge of the audit. 
• All audit reports must describe the scope of testing of the company’s internal control 
structure and must present the auditor’s findings from the testing, including an 
evaluation of whether the internal control structure is acceptable, a description of 
material weaknesses in internal controls, and any material noncompliance with controls.  
 
Inspections of Registered Public Accounting Firms 
The Act also authorizes the Board to conduct regular inspections of public accounting firms 
to assess their degree of compliance with laws, rules, and professional standards regarding 
audits. Inspections are to be conducted once a year for firms that regularly audit more than 
100 public companies and at least once every three years for firms that regularly audit 
between 1 and 100 public companies.  
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.206                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Investigations and Disciplinary Proceedings 
The Board has the authority to investigate registered public accounting firms (or their 
employees) for potential violations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, professional standards, any 
rules established by the Board, or any securities laws relating to the preparation and issuance 
of audit reports. During an investigation, the Board has the power to compel testimony and 
document production.  
 
The Board also has the power to issue sanctions for violations or for non-cooperation with 
an investigation. Sanctions can include temporary or permanent suspension of a firm’s 
registration with the Board (which would mean the firm could no longer legally audit 
publicly traded companies), temporary or permanent suspension of a person’s right to be 
associated with a registered public accounting firm, prohibition from auditing public 
companies, and civil monetary penalties of up to $750,000 for an individual and up to 
$15,000,000 for a firm.  
 
Officers and Directors 
The Act includes several responsibilities for the officers and directors of public companies. 
 
Certification Obligations
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of public companies must 
personally certify annual and quarterly SEC filings.  
 
Section 302 of the Act requires that the CEO and CFO personally certify the following: 
• They have personally reviewed the report.  
• Based on their knowledge, the report does not contain any material misstatement that 
would render the report misleading. 
• Based on their knowledge, the financial statements and information in the report fairly 
present, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the 
company.  
• They are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls and have 
designed such controls to ensure that material information relating to the company and 
its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to them; they have evaluated the 
effectiveness of internal controls within 90 days prior to the report; and they have 
presented their conclusions about the effectiveness of those controls in the report. 
• They have disclosed to their auditors and the audit committee any significant deficiencies 
in the controls that could adversely affect the company’s ability to record, process, 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.207 
summarize, and report financial data, and they have identified for their auditors any 
material weaknesses in internal controls. Further, they have disclosed to their auditors 
any fraud, whether material or not, that involves management or other employees who 
have a significant role in the company’s internal controls. 
• They have indicated in their report whether there have been significant changes in the 
company’s internal controls since the filing of  the last report, including any corrective 
actions with respect to previously identified significant deficiencies and material 
weaknesses. 
 
Internal Controls 
Under Section 404 of the Act, and SEC Release Nos. 33-8238 and 34-47986, management’s 
responsibility pertaining to the company’s internal control over financial reporting has been 
increased substantially.  
 
DEFINING INTERNAL CONTROL 
Internal control over financial reporting (ICOFR) is defined as: 
 
“ A process designed … to provide reasonable assurance re garding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles….” 
 
Additionally, ICOFR is deemed to include all policies and procedures that: 
• “Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the [company]; 
• Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the [company] are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the [company]; and 
• Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition, use or disposition of the [company ’s] assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements.” 
 
Examples of internal controls covered by Section 404 and the related Releases and Standards 
include, but are not limited to: 
  
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.208                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• Controls over initiating, authorizing, recording, processing, reconciling, and reporting 
significant account balances, transactions, and disclosures included in the financial 
statements. 
• Controls related to the prevention, identification, and detection of fraud. 
• Controls related to initiating and processing of non-routing and non-systematic 
transactions. 
• Controls related to the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies.  
 
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL 
The provisions of Section 404 require management to acknowledge its responsibility for the 
ICOFR of the company and to assess the operating effectiveness of those controls. As a 
result, public companies must issue an additional internal control report within their annual 
report containing: 
• A statement of management’s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate 
ICOFR; 
• A statement identifying the framework that management used in conducting the 
assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s ICOFR; 
• Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s ICOFR as of the end of 
the company’s most recent fiscal year, including disclosure of any material weaknesses 
identified in the company’s ICOFR and an explicit statement as to whether the ICOFR 
is effective; and 
• A statement that the company’s independent auditor has issued an attestation report 
covering management’s assessment of the company’s ICOFR. The auditor’s attestation 
report must also be filed with the annual report.  
 
MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL 
In performing the ICOFR assessment, management must choose a suitable internal control 
framework against which to evaluate the design and effectiveness of the company’s ICOFR. 
The most commonly used model in the United States is the Internal Control—Integrated 
Framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the 
Treadway Commission, which provides five components of effective internal controls: 
• Control Environment 
• Control Activities 
• Risk Assessment 
• Information and Communication 
• Monitoring 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.209 
The COSO framework is discussed in more detail in the “Fraud Prevention Programs” 
chapter in the Fraud Prevention and Deterrence section of the Fraud Examiners Manual. 
Further detail on the Internal Control—Integrated Framework is also available at the COSO 
website (http://www.coso.org). 
  
Additionally, management must: 
• Determine which internal controls to test in performing the assessment, considering the 
significance of each control, both individually and in the aggregate; 
• Evaluate whether the failure of a control could result in a misstatement to the financial 
statements, the likelihood and magnitude of any resulting misstatement, and whether 
other controls are in place to mitigate this occurrence; 
• Determine which locations or business units to include in the assessment, if applicable; 
• Evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of the internal controls using the internal 
control framework chosen as a guide; 
• Evaluate the probability of occurrence and the size of potential misstatements resulting 
from the internal control deficiencies identified and determine whether they, either 
individually or in the aggregate, constitute material weaknesses (any deficiency where the 
likelihood of potential misstatement is more than remote) or significant deficiencies (any 
deficiency where the likelihood of potential misstatement is more than remote and the 
magnitude is more than inconsequential); 
• Provide sufficient documentation to support the assessment of ICOFR, including 
documenting the design of the internal controls and the results of management’s testing 
and evaluation; and 
• Communicate the assessment findings to the independent auditor and any other 
applicable parties. 
 
Recognizing that each company differs with regard to internal control structure, the rules 
state that the nature of the testing performed by management will depend on the specific 
circumstances of the company and the significance of the control being tested. However, the 
rules also assert that inquiries alone are generally not a sufficient basis for management’s 
assessment.  
 
In July 2007, the SEC issued guidance specifically  addressed to management about fulfilling 
their responsibilities pertaining to reporting on internal control over financial reporting. The 
guidance emphasizes a top-down, risk-based approach to management’s evaluation of 
ICOFR, and explicitly states that an evaluation performed in compliance with the guidance is 
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.210                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
one way that management can satisfy the internal control requirements established by 
Sarbanes-Oxley. In providing direction to assist companies’ management in evaluation and 
assessment of the ICOFR, the Guidance addresses the following topics: 
• Identifying Financial Reporting Risks and Controls 
• Evaluating Evidence of the Operating Effectiveness of ICOFR 
• Reporting Considerations 
 
The full text of the SEC interpretive guidance can be found at 
http://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2007/33-8810.pdf.  
 
Code of Ethics 
As required by Section 406 of the Act and SEC Release No. 33-8177, public companies must 
disclose in their annual report whether they have adopted a code of ethics for senior 
financial officers, and if they have not, they must explain their reasoning.  
 
DEFINING “CODE OF ETHICS” 
The rules define a “code of ethics” as a set of written standards that are designed to deter 
wrongdoing and to promote: 
• Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical treatment of actual or apparent 
conflicts of interest between personal and professional interests; 
• Full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in all documents filed with the 
SEC and all other public communications; 
• Compliance with all applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations; 
• The prompt reporting to the appropriate person or persons within the company of 
violations of the code; and 
• Accountability for adherence to the code. 
 
The SEC believes that the establishment of provisions beyond this definitional outline is 
best left to the discretion of the company. Therefore, the rules do not specify any detailed 
requirements, particular language, compliance procedures, or sanctions for violations that 
must be included in the code of ethics. The SEC does, however, explicitly encourage the 
adoption of codes that are broader and more comprehensive than necessary to meet the 
disclosure requirements. 
 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.211 
SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS 
The senior financial officers that must be covered by the company’s code of ethics include 
the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or 
controller, and persons performing similar functions. While the rules state that a company 
must have a specialized code of ethics that applies to senior financial officers, the company 
does not need to adopt a separate code of ethics for these officers. However, if it does not, 
the company’s general code of ethics should ex pressly state that it applies to all senior 
financial officers.  
 
DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS 
In addition to the disclosure of the existence of the code of ethics in the annual report, the 
rules require that companies make publicly available the portions of their code of ethics that 
address the ethical considerations contained within the definition of “code of ethics” and 
that apply to the senior financial officers. To do so, the SEC permits companies to employ 
one of three alternative methods: 
• Filing the code of ethics that applies to the senior financial officers as an exhibit in the 
company’s annual report; 
• Posting the code of ethics that is relevant to the senior financial officers on its website, 
and disclosing the Internet address and the fact that the code is posted in this manner 
within the annual report; or 
• Providing a copy of the code of ethics to any person upon request, and without charge, 
provided the annual report contains an undertaking to do so and an explanation of how 
a person can make such a request.  
 
Public companies must also make known, either on a Form 8-K or on their website, any 
changes in and any waivers of the code of ethics relating to the senior financial officers. The 
nature of the change or waiver must be disclosed within five business days of its occurrence 
and, if disclosed on a website, must remain posted for 12 months.  
 
EXAMPLES OF CODES OF ETHICS 
The following are some examples of organizations that have adopted codes of ethics that 
meet the SEC’s guidelines. Additionally, the ACFE’s sample code of ethics is contained in 
the “Fraud Prevention Programs” chapter in the Fraud Prevention and Deterrence section 
of the Fraud Examiners Manual.

Audit Committee 
The audit committee of a company is a committee established by the board of directors for 
the purpose of overseeing the accounting, financial reporting, and auditing processes. 
Sections 301 and 407 of the Act and SEC Release Nos. 33-8177, 33-8220, 34-47235, and 34-
 47654 set out specific requirements for audit committees of public companies.  
 
Composition of the Audit Committee 
INDEPENDENCE 
Each member of the audit committee must be a member of the board of directors and must 
be “independent,” as evaluated by two criteria: 
• Fees—Audit committee members may only be compensated for their services on the 
board and any board committee. They cannot be paid by the company, or any of its 
subsidiaries, for any other consulting or advisory work, including indirect payments 
made by the company to a party related to the committee member. Audit committee 
members may receive any fixed retirement benefits they are entitled to for prior service 
with the company without violating this provision, as long as the benefits are not 
contingent upon the member’s continued service. 
• Affiliation—Audit committee members cannot be “affiliated persons” of the company 
or any other company related to it. This precludes executive officers, 
director/employees, general partners, and managing members of the company, or its 
parent, subsidiary, or sister company, from serving on the audit committee. There is a 
safe harbor provision that excludes members from being considered an affiliated person 
as long as they are not an executive officer of the company or any of its subsidiaries, and 
they are not a shareholder of 10 percent or more of any class of voting stock of the 
company or any of its subsidiaries. 
 
The SEC permits three exemptions from the independence standards. The first provides a 
one-year phase-in period for public non-investment companies, whereby there must be at 
least one fully independent member when the company goes public, a majority of 
independent members within 90 days, and a fully independent committee within one year. 
The second exemption allows a committee member to simultaneously sit on the board of 
directors of the company and of an affiliated company (i.e., a parent, subsidiary, or sister 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.213 
company) without being considered an affiliated person, provided the member otherwise 
meets the independence criteria. The final exemption exists to provide a number of 
accommodations for “foreign private issuers,” or listed companies that are incorporated 
outside of the United States. The SEC has stated that beyond these three exemptions, no 
additional exemptions will be granted, nor will it consider exemptions or waivers for 
particular relationships on a case-by-case basis. 
 
FINANCIAL EXPERT 
The board of directors must include a disclosure in the company’s annual report stating 
whether or not there is at least one member of its audit committee that qualifies as an “audit 
committee financial expert.” If there is, the company must also include the name of the 
expert, and whether the expert is independent from management. If there is not, an 
explanation must be given as to why the committee does not have such an expert. 
Additionally, the board is permitted, but not required, to disclose that it has more than one 
audit committee financial expert on its audit committee. 
 
To qualify as an “audit committee financial expert,” an individual must possess: 
• An understanding of generally accepted accounting principles and of financial 
statements; 
• The ability to evaluate the application of accounting principles used in the accounting for 
estimates, accruals, and reserves; 
• Experience in preparing, auditing, analyzing, or evaluating financial statements 
containing accounting issues that are “gene rally comparable” to those expected to be 
raised in the company’s financial statements, or experience supervising someone engaged 
in such activities; 
• An understanding of internal controls and financial reporting procedures; and 
• An understanding of the functions of an audit committee. 
 
The rules state that the audit committee financial expert must have acquired these attributes 
through education and experience from serving as or actively supervising a principal 
financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller, public accountant or auditor, or 
other similar position, or through the oversight or assessment of companies or public 
accountants regarding the preparation, audit, or evaluation of financial statements. The SEC 
also recognizes that individuals that do not meet any of these requirements but have “other 
relevant experience” may qualify as an audit committee financial expert. However, any board 
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.214                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
of directors that qualifies an expert under this category is required to provide a brief listing 
of that person’s experience with the disclosure in the annual report.  
 
In determining whether an individual qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, the 
board of directors should consider all relevant facts and circumstances including, but not 
limited to, certain qualitative factors, such as the level of the person’s accounting or financial 
education, whether the person is a CPA, whether the person has previously served as a CFO 
or controller of a public company, the person’s past or current membership on other audit 
committees, and any other relevant qualifications or experience that would assist in 
understanding and evaluating the company’s financial statements. The SEC emphasizes that 
such factors are merely examples and should be considered only as part of an evaluation of 
the person’s knowledge and experience as a whole. 
 
To dissuade hesitancy to serve as an audit committee financial expert, the SEC has expressly 
stated that the duties, obligations, and liability of the member serving as the expert are no 
greater than the duties, obligations, and liability of all other members of the audit committee. 
Similarly, the designation of an audit committee member as a financial expert does not 
change the duties, obligations, or liability of any other board or audit committee members.  
 
Responsibilities Relating to External Auditors 
The audit committee has sole responsibility for hiring, paying, retaining, overseeing, and, if 
necessary, firing the company’s outside auditors, as well as the ultimate authority to approve 
all audit engagement fees and terms. As a result, the external auditors must report directly to 
the audit committee. The committee is also charged with resolving any disputes that arise 
between the external auditors and management regarding financial reporting issues. 
 
All audit and permitted non-audit services, other than de minimis services, provided by the 
external auditor must be pre-approved by the audit committee. The audit committee can 
accomplish this either by approving all services separately prior to each engagement or by 
establishing a detailed set of pre-approval policies and procedures covering all engagements, 
as long as the audit committee is informed on a timely basis of each service and the 
responsibility of pre-approval cannot be shifted to management. If the committee chooses 
to implement a set of pre-approval policies and procedures, then either a clear description or 
copy of those policies and procedures must be included with the company’s proxy 
statement. 
 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.215 
Procedures for Handling Complaints 
The audit committee is required to establish procedures (e.g., a hotline) for receiving, 
retaining, and dealing with complaints, including confidential or anonymous employee tips, 
regarding irregularities in the company’s accounting methods, internal controls, or auditing 
matters.  
 
The SEC does not require any specific procedures for handling complaints, but rather allows 
the audit committee to determine the most appropriate procedures for the company’s 
circumstances. Included in this flexibility is the ability of the audit committee to defer the 
receipt and screening of the complaints to another party, such as a messaging service. 
However, when complaints are received by a party outside of the audit committee, the 
procedures should dictate that the tips are ultimately directed to the audit committee for 
resolution. Further, the procedures should be designed such that management is not 
exclusively responsible for receiving and screening the complaints, to prevent unscrupulous 
managers from mishandling complaints or retaliating against employee complainants. 
Ultimately, the enactment of formal procedures should encourage the disclosure of concerns 
and promote proper conduct throughout the organization. The established procedures 
should also allow the audit committee to be alerted to potential problems before serious 
consequences arise. 
 
Authority to Engage Outside Advisors 
In certain situations, audit committees may want to consult experts other than those hired by 
management, especially when faced with possible conflicts of management interests. The 
rules provide that audit committees are allowed to engage any outside advisors, such as 
experts in specific accounting issues, that may be necessary to properly carry out their duties.  
 
Funding 
The audit committee is entitled to receive appropriate funding from the company for: 
• Fees paid to the external auditors for performance of any audit, review, or attestation 
engagements; 
• Payments to any outside advisors retained by the audit committee; and 
• Any administrative expenses necessary for the audit committee to carry out its duties.

External Auditors 
Reports to the Audit Committee 
Auditors must report directly to the audit committee—not management—and must make 
timely reports on the following: 
• All critical accounting policies and practices used; 
• Alternative GAAP methods that were discussed with management, the ramifications of 
the use of those alternative treatments, and the treatment preferred by the auditors; and 
• Any other material written communications between the auditors and management, such 
as any management letter or the schedule of unadjusted audit differences. 
 
Report over Internal Controls 
Auditors must also now attest to and issue a report on management’s assessment of internal 
control over financial reporting under Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. This requirement is 
covered in more detail in the previous section on PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5 — An 
Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting That Is Integrated with  An Audit of Financial 
Statements. 
 
Whistleblower Protection 
In addition to requiring the audit committee to establish procedures to handle employee tips 
and complaints, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act includes two provisions that create broad 
protections for corporate whistleblowers.  
 
Civil Liability 
Section 806 of the Act creates a civil liability for an employer who, out of retaliation, fires, 
demotes, suspends, threatens, harasses, or discriminates against an employee who provided 
information or otherwise assisted in an investigation of fraudulent activity. Employees are 
also protected against retaliation for filing, testifying, participating, or otherwise assisting in a 
proceeding filed or about to be filed relating to an alleged violation of securities laws and 
regulations. Employees that were retaliated against in such a manner are entitled to 
compensatory damages under Section 806, including reinstatement with back pay and 
interest and compensation for legal fees. It should be noted, however, that this provision 
does not provide protection to all whistleblowers as it only covers employees of publicly 
traded companies.  
 
Financial Transactions Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.217 
Criminal Sanctions 
Section 1107 of the Act establishes criminal sanctions for anyone who intentionally retaliates 
against another party for providing information regarding an alleged Federal offense to a law 
enforcement officer. Punishments for violating the provision include fines of up to $250,000 
and up to 10 years in prison for individuals and fines of up to $500,000 for corporations. 
Unlike the civil liability, the protection provided under Section 1107 applies to all individuals, 
regardless of where they work.  
 
The whistleblower protection provisions are discussed in more detail in the “Law Related to 
Fraud” chapter in the Law section of the Fraud Examiners Manual. 
 
Civil and Criminal Penalties for Noncompliance 
Depending on which particular provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is violated, the penalties 
can be severe. In addition to creating additional criminal offenses (e.g., the whistleblower 
retaliation crime discussed above), it increases the jail term for existing crimes such as mail 
fraud and wire fraud from five to twenty years. It also makes it a crime to destroy documents 
and requires auditors of public companies to keep work papers for at least five years. 
 
The Act also authorizes the SEC to freeze questioned assets during an investigation. 
Additionally, section 304 of the Act requires that if a public company is required to prepare 
an accounting restatement due to misconduct that results in material non-compliance with 
any financial reporting requirement, the CEO and CFO shall reimburse the company for:  
• Any bonuses or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation that they received 
during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing (whichever is 
earlier) of a financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement; and 
• Profits on the sale of company securities during such 12-month period. 
 
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act  
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 drastically changed the procedures and 
proof required in securities fraud cases. It also included additional responsibilities for 
independent auditors of public companies. Under the Act, each audit of the financial 
statements of a public company must include the following: 
• Procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of detecting illegal acts that would 
have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. 
• Procedures designed to identify related-party transactions that are material to the 
financial statements or otherwise require disclosure therein. 
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.218                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• An evaluation of whether there is substantial doubt about the ability of the issuer to 
continue as a going concern during the ensuing fiscal year. 
 
The term illegal act is defined to mean any act or omission “that violates any law, rule, or 
regulation having the force of law.” 
 
Additionally, if in the course of an audit, an auditor “detects or otherwise becomes aware 
that an illegal act (whether or not perceived to have a material effect on the financial 
statements of the issuer) has or might have occurred,” the auditor must then: 
• Determine and consider the possible effect of the illegal act on the financial statements 
of the company, including any contingent monetary effects such as fines, penalties, and 
damages; 
• Inform the appropriate level of management “as soon as practicable”; and 
• Assure that the audit committee (or the board of directors in the absence of an audit 
committee) is adequately informed of the illegal acts that have been detected unless such 
acts are “clearly inconsequential.” 
 
The Reform Act provides further that the auditor must take notice of what, if any, action is 
taken by the company in response. If the auditor concludes that the illegal act has a material 
effect on the financial statements of the company, the auditor must then determine: 
• Whether senior management has taken “tim ely and appropriate remedial actions,” and 
• Whether the failure to take remedial action is “reasonably expected to warrant departure 
from a standard report of the auditor, when made, or warrant resignation from the audit 
engagement.”  
 
If the auditor concludes that senior management has failed to appropriately address the 
situation, he must report his conclusions to the board of directors. If the board receives such 
a report, the board is then required to notify the SEC within one business day and send a 
copy of the SEC notice to the auditor. If the auditor does not receive a copy of this notice 
before the one-day deadline, then the auditor is required to furnish the SEC with a copy of 
his report to the board. 
 
The auditor is provided with some protection, however. The Act expressly provides that the 
auditor cannot be liable in a private action for any statements contained in the auditor’s 
report to the SEC.
