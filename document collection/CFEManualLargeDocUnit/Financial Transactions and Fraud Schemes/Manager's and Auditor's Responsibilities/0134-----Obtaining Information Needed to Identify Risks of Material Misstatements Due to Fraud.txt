Obtaining Information Needed to Identify Risks of Material Misstatements Due to Fraud 
AU section 314, Understanding the Entity and Its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material 
Misstatement, provides guidance on how the auditor obtains knowledge about the entity and 
its environment, including its internal control. As part of that process, the auditor should 
perform the following procedures to obtain information to use in identifying the risks of 
material misstatement due to fraud: 
• Make inquiries of management and others within the entity to obtain their views on the 
risks of fraud and how those risks are addressed; 
• Consider any unusual or unexpected relationships that have been identified in 
performing analytical procedures in planning the audit; 
• Consider whether one or more fraud risk factors exist; and 
• Consider other information that may be helpful in the identification of risks of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
 
MAKING INQUIRIES OF MANAGEMENT AND OTHERS WITHIN THE ENTITY TO OBTAIN THEIR VIEWS ABOUT THE RISKS OF FRAUD AND HOW THOSE RISKS ARE ADDRESSED 
This step involves asking management about a number of issues, including: 
• Whether management has knowledge of fraud or suspected fraud; 
• Management’s understanding of the risks of fraud; 
• Programs and controls the entity has established to help prevent, deter, or detect fraud; 
and 
• Whether and how management communicates to employees its views on business 
practices and ethical behavior. 
 
The auditor should also question the audit committee directly about its views concerning the 
risks of fraud and whether the committee has knowledge of fraud or suspected fraud. The 
same should be done with the company’s internal audit department.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.227 
Additionally, the auditor may need to conduct similar inquiries of the entity’s other 
personnel if the auditor believes they may have additional information about the risks of 
fraud. 
 
CONSIDERING THE RESULTS OF ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES PERFORMED IN PLANNING THE AUDIT  
AU section 329, Analytical Procedures, requires that analytical procedures be performed in 
planning the audit with the objective of identifying the existence of unusual transactions or 
events, and amounts, ratios, and trends that might indicate matters “that have financial 
statement and audit planning implications.” If  the results of these procedures yield unusual 
or unexpected relationships, the auditor should consider the results in identifying the risks of 
material misstatement due to fraud. 
 
CONSIDERING FRAUD RISK FACTORS 
As discussed above, even though fraud is concealed, the auditor may identify events or 
conditions that indicate incentives or pressures to commit fraud, opportunities to carry out 
fraud, or attitudes and rationalizations to justify fraudulent conduct. These events and 
conditions are referred to as “fraud risk factors.” The auditor should consider whether one 
or more fraud risk factors are present and should be considered in identifying and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement due to fraud. However, the auditor should be careful not 
to create a laundry list of factors that are only given cursory consideration. The Appendix to 
AU section 316 contains a list of examples of fraud risk factors. 
 
CONSIDERING OTHER INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IN IDENTIFYING RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT DUE TO FRAUD 
Finally, the auditor should consider any other information that might be helpful in 
identifying the risks of material misstatement due to fraud.
