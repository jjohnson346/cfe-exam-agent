Code of Ethics 
As required by Section 406 of the Act and SEC Release No. 33-8177, public companies must 
disclose in their annual report whether they have adopted a code of ethics for senior 
financial officers, and if they have not, they must explain their reasoning.  
 
DEFINING “CODE OF ETHICS” 
The rules define a “code of ethics” as a set of written standards that are designed to deter 
wrongdoing and to promote: 
• Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical treatment of actual or apparent 
conflicts of interest between personal and professional interests; 
• Full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in all documents filed with the 
SEC and all other public communications; 
• Compliance with all applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations; 
• The prompt reporting to the appropriate person or persons within the company of 
violations of the code; and 
• Accountability for adherence to the code. 
 
The SEC believes that the establishment of provisions beyond this definitional outline is 
best left to the discretion of the company. Therefore, the rules do not specify any detailed 
requirements, particular language, compliance procedures, or sanctions for violations that 
must be included in the code of ethics. The SEC does, however, explicitly encourage the 
adoption of codes that are broader and more comprehensive than necessary to meet the 
disclosure requirements.

SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS 
The senior financial officers that must be covered by the company’s code of ethics include 
the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or 
controller, and persons performing similar functions. While the rules state that a company 
must have a specialized code of ethics that applies to senior financial officers, the company 
does not need to adopt a separate code of ethics for these officers. However, if it does not, 
the company’s general code of ethics should ex pressly state that it applies to all senior 
financial officers.  
 
DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS 
In addition to the disclosure of the existence of the code of ethics in the annual report, the 
rules require that companies make publicly available the portions of their code of ethics that 
address the ethical considerations contained within the definition of “code of ethics” and 
that apply to the senior financial officers. To do so, the SEC permits companies to employ 
one of three alternative methods: 
• Filing the code of ethics that applies to the senior financial officers as an exhibit in the 
company’s annual report; 
• Posting the code of ethics that is relevant to the senior financial officers on its website, 
and disclosing the Internet address and the fact that the code is posted in this manner 
within the annual report; or 
• Providing a copy of the code of ethics to any person upon request, and without charge, 
provided the annual report contains an undertaking to do so and an explanation of how 
a person can make such a request.  
 
Public companies must also make known, either on a Form 8-K or on their website, any 
changes in and any waivers of the code of ethics relating to the senior financial officers. The 
nature of the change or waiver must be disclosed within five business days of its occurrence 
and, if disclosed on a website, must remain posted for 12 months.  
 
EXAMPLES OF CODES OF ETHICS 
The following are some examples of organizations that have adopted codes of ethics that 
meet the SEC’s guidelines. Additionally, the ACFE’s sample code of ethics is contained in 
the “Fraud Prevention Programs” chapter in the Fraud Prevention and Deterrence section 
of the Fraud Examiners Manual.
