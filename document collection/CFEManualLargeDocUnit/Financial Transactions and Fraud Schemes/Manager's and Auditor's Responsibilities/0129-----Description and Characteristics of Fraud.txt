Description and Characteristics of Fraud 
AU section 316 emphasizes that while auditors do not make legal determinations about the 
existence of fraud, they should be interested in all acts that result in material misstatements 
of the financial statements. Such misstatements can be the result of either fraud or error, 
depending on whether the misstatements are intentional or unintentional.  
 
Two types of misstatements are considered relevant for audit purposes: 
• Misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting 
• Misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets 
 
MISSTATEMENTS ARISING FROM FRAUDULENT FINANCIAL REPORTING 
This category is defined as intentional misstatements or omissions of amounts or disclosures 
in financial statements that are “designed to deceive financial statement users.”   
 
Fraudulent financial reporting may be accomplished by: 
• Manipulating, falsifying, or altering acco unting records or supporting documents; 
• Misrepresenting or intentionally omitting events, transactions, or other significant 
information; or  
• Intentionally misapplying accounting principles relating to amounts, classification, 
manner of presentation, or disclosure. 
 
MISSTATEMENTS ARISING FROM MISAPPROPRIATION OF ASSETS 
Also referred to as theft or defalcation, this category includes the theft of an entity’s assets 
where the effect of the theft causes the financial statements, in all material respects, not to be 
in conformity with GAAP. 
 
AU section 316 goes on to remind the auditor that, by definition, fraud often is concealed, 
and management is in a position to perpetrate fraud more easily because it is in a position of 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities

being able to directly or indirectly manipulate accounting records. Auditors cannot obtain 
absolute assurance that material misstatements are not present, but auditors should be aware 
of the possibility that fraud might be concealed and that employees might be in collusion 
with each other or outside vendors. If auditors notice records or activities that seem unusual, 
then they should at least consider the possibility that fraud might have occurred.
