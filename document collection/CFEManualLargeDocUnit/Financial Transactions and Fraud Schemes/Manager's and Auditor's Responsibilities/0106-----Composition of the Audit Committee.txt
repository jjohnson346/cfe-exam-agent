Composition of the Audit Committee 
INDEPENDENCE 
Each member of the audit committee must be a member of the board of directors and must 
be “independent,” as evaluated by two criteria: 
• Fees—Audit committee members may only be compensated for their services on the 
board and any board committee. They cannot be paid by the company, or any of its 
subsidiaries, for any other consulting or advisory work, including indirect payments 
made by the company to a party related to the committee member. Audit committee 
members may receive any fixed retirement benefits they are entitled to for prior service 
with the company without violating this provision, as long as the benefits are not 
contingent upon the member’s continued service. 
• Affiliation—Audit committee members cannot be “affiliated persons” of the company 
or any other company related to it. This precludes executive officers, 
director/employees, general partners, and managing members of the company, or its 
parent, subsidiary, or sister company, from serving on the audit committee. There is a 
safe harbor provision that excludes members from being considered an affiliated person 
as long as they are not an executive officer of the company or any of its subsidiaries, and 
they are not a shareholder of 10 percent or more of any class of voting stock of the 
company or any of its subsidiaries. 
 
The SEC permits three exemptions from the independence standards. The first provides a 
one-year phase-in period for public non-investment companies, whereby there must be at 
least one fully independent member when the company goes public, a majority of 
independent members within 90 days, and a fully independent committee within one year. 
The second exemption allows a committee member to simultaneously sit on the board of 
directors of the company and of an affiliated company (i.e., a parent, subsidiary, or sister 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.213 
company) without being considered an affiliated person, provided the member otherwise 
meets the independence criteria. The final exemption exists to provide a number of 
accommodations for “foreign private issuers,” or listed companies that are incorporated 
outside of the United States. The SEC has stated that beyond these three exemptions, no 
additional exemptions will be granted, nor will it consider exemptions or waivers for 
particular relationships on a case-by-case basis. 
 
FINANCIAL EXPERT 
The board of directors must include a disclosure in the company’s annual report stating 
whether or not there is at least one member of its audit committee that qualifies as an “audit 
committee financial expert.” If there is, the company must also include the name of the 
expert, and whether the expert is independent from management. If there is not, an 
explanation must be given as to why the committee does not have such an expert. 
Additionally, the board is permitted, but not required, to disclose that it has more than one 
audit committee financial expert on its audit committee. 
 
To qualify as an “audit committee financial expert,” an individual must possess: 
• An understanding of generally accepted accounting principles and of financial 
statements; 
• The ability to evaluate the application of accounting principles used in the accounting for 
estimates, accruals, and reserves; 
• Experience in preparing, auditing, analyzing, or evaluating financial statements 
containing accounting issues that are “gene rally comparable” to those expected to be 
raised in the company’s financial statements, or experience supervising someone engaged 
in such activities; 
• An understanding of internal controls and financial reporting procedures; and 
• An understanding of the functions of an audit committee. 
 
The rules state that the audit committee financial expert must have acquired these attributes 
through education and experience from serving as or actively supervising a principal 
financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller, public accountant or auditor, or 
other similar position, or through the oversight or assessment of companies or public 
accountants regarding the preparation, audit, or evaluation of financial statements. The SEC 
also recognizes that individuals that do not meet any of these requirements but have “other 
relevant experience” may qualify as an audit committee financial expert. However, any board 
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.214                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
of directors that qualifies an expert under this category is required to provide a brief listing 
of that person’s experience with the disclosure in the annual report.  
 
In determining whether an individual qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, the 
board of directors should consider all relevant facts and circumstances including, but not 
limited to, certain qualitative factors, such as the level of the person’s accounting or financial 
education, whether the person is a CPA, whether the person has previously served as a CFO 
or controller of a public company, the person’s past or current membership on other audit 
committees, and any other relevant qualifications or experience that would assist in 
understanding and evaluating the company’s financial statements. The SEC emphasizes that 
such factors are merely examples and should be considered only as part of an evaluation of 
the person’s knowledge and experience as a whole. 
 
To dissuade hesitancy to serve as an audit committee financial expert, the SEC has expressly 
stated that the duties, obligations, and liability of the member serving as the expert are no 
greater than the duties, obligations, and liability of all other members of the audit committee. 
Similarly, the designation of an audit committee member as a financial expert does not 
change the duties, obligations, or liability of any other board or audit committee members.
