Document Destruction 
An organization must cease destruction of documents when faced with potential litigation or 
when a legal document request is pending or imminent. Destruction under a valid DRP will 
be ineffective if documents are not actually destroyed before a potential litigation trigger 
occurs. Thus, it is imperative that the DRP provides for complete destruction of documents 
that can be validly expunged during the proper periods under the policy. Documents should 
be destroyed by shredding or by some other means that will render them unreadable. 
Similarly, a protocol for the destruction of electronic data should be in place to ensure that 
documents to be destroyed are actually destroyed. The deletion of e-mails or other files on 
one’s computer does not mean that such records are removed from evidence.
