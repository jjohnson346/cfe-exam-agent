Discussion Among Engagement Personnel Regarding Risk of Material Misstatement Due to Fraud 
Prior to or in conjunction with the information-gathering procedures discussed below, the 
members of the audit team should discuss the potential for material misstatements due to 
fraud. 
 
The discussion should include “brainstorming” among the audit team members about the 
following: 
• How and where they believe the entity’s financial statements might be susceptible to 
fraud; 
• How management could perpetrate or conceal fraud; and  
• How assets of the entity could be misappropriated. 
 
This discussion should also include a consideration of known external and internal factors 
affecting the entity that might: 
• Create incentives/pressures for management and others to commit fraud; 
• Provide the opportunity for fraud to be perpetrated; and 
• Indicate a culture or environment that enables management and others to rationalize 
committing fraud.
