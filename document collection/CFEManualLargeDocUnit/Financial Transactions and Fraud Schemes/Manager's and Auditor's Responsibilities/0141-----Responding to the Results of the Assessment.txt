Responding to the Results of the Assessment 
Once the auditor has gathered the information and assessed the risk of fraud, he must 
determine what impact the assessment will have on how the audit is conducted. For 
example, the auditor may need to design additional or different audit procedures to obtain 
more reliable evidence in support of account balances, transactions, etc., or to obtain 
additional corroboration of management’s expl anations and representations concerning 
material matters (e.g., third-party confirmation, documentation from independent sources, 
use of a specialist, and analytical procedures). 
 
OVERALL RESPONSES TO THE RISK OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT 
Judgments about the risk of material misstatem ent due to fraud have an overall effect on 
how the audit is conducted in several ways: 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.229 
• Assignment of personnel and supervision. The auditor may need to consult with 
specialists in a particular field. 
• Accounting principles. The auditor should consider management’s selection and 
application of significant accounting principles, particularly those related to subjective 
measurements and complex transactions. 
• Predictability of auditing procedures. The auditor should incorporate an “element of 
unpredictability” in the selection of auditing procedures to be performed, such as using 
differing sampling methods, and performing procedures at different locations or at 
locations on an unannounced basis. 
 
RESPONSES INVOLVING THE NATURE, TIMING, AND EXTENT OF PROCEDURES TO BE PERFORMED TO ADDRESS THE IDENTIFIED RISKS 
This section notes that the auditing procedures performed in response to identified risks will 
vary depending on the type of risks identified. Such procedures may involve both 
substantive tests and tests of the operating effectiveness of the entity’s internal controls. 
However, because management may have the ability to override controls that may otherwise 
appear to be operating effectively, it is unlikely that the audit risk can be reduced 
appropriately by performing only tests of controls. 
  
Therefore, the auditor’s response to specifically identified risks of fraud should include the 
following: 
• Changing the nature  of the auditing procedures to obtain more reliable or additional 
corroborative information by, for example, consulting independent sources or 
conducting physical inspections; 
• Changing the timing  of substantive tests by, for example, conducting substantive tests at 
or near the end of a reporting period; and 
• Ensuring the extent  of the procedures reflects the assessment of the risk of fraud by, for 
example, increasing sample sizes or performing analytical procedures at a more detailed 
level. 
 
EXAMPLES OF RESPONSES TO IDENTIFIED RISKS OF MISSTATEMENTS ARISING FROM FRAUDULENT FINANCIAL REPORTING  
AU section 316 provides a number of examples of responses the auditor may take in regard 
to risks of misstatements arising from both fraudulent financial reporting and asset 
misappropriation. 
 
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.230                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Some of the examples of testing auditors may perform to address the risk of fraudulent 
financial reporting include: 
• Revenue recognition—Performing substantive analytical procedures relating to revenue 
using disaggregated data (for example, comparing revenue reported by month and by 
product line during the current reporting period with comparable prior periods); 
confirming with customers relevant contract terms; or questioning staff about shipments 
near the end of a period. 
• Inventory quantities—Examining inventory records to identify locations or items that 
require specific attention during or after the physical inventory count; performing a more 
rigorous examination of the count, such as examining contents of boxed items; and 
conducting additional testing of count sheets, tags, or other records. 
• Management estimates—Developing or engaging  a specialist to develop an independent 
estimate for comparison to management’s estimate and gathering further information to 
help evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and underlying assumptions. 
 
EXAMPLES OF RESPONSES TO IDENTIFIED RISKS OF MISSTATEMENTS ARISING FROM MISAPPROPRIATIONS OF ASSETS 
If the auditor identifies a risk of material misstatement due to fraud relating to 
misappropriation of assets, the auditor may wish to include additional procedures. For 
example, if a particular asset is highly susceptible to misappropriation, the auditor may wish 
to conduct further testing of the controls to prevent and detect such misappropriation. 
 
RESPONSES TO FURTHER ADDRESS RISK OF MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS 
Because management is in a unique position to override existing controls, if such a risk is 
identified, the auditor may need to perform additional procedures to further address the risk 
of management override of controls. 
 
EXAMINING JOURNAL ENTRIES AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS FOR EVIDENCE OF POSSIBLE MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT DUE TO FRAUD  
Material misstatements of financial statements often involve recording inappropriate or 
unauthorized journal entries, or making adjustments to amounts reported in the financial 
statements that are not reflected in journal entries (e.g., consolidating adjustments or 
reclassifications). Therefore, the auditor should design procedures to test the appropriateness 
of journal entries recorded in the general ledger and of other adjustments (e.g., entries 
posted directly to financial statement drafts). 
 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.231 
REVIEWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES FOR BIASES THAT COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT DUE TO FRAUD  
In preparing financial statements, management is responsible for making a number of 
judgments or assumptions that affect significant accounting estimates. Fraudulent financial 
reporting is often accomplished through intentional misstatement of these estimates. In 
performing the audit, the auditor should consider whether the differences between estimates 
supported by the audit evidence and the estimates included in the financial statements 
indicate a possible bias on the part of management. If so, the auditor should perform a 
retrospective review of significant accounting estimates of the prior year. This review should 
provide the auditor with additional information about whether management may have a bias 
in presenting the current-year estimates. 
 
EVALUATING THE BUSINESS RATIONALE FOR SIGNIFICANT UNUSUAL TRANSACTIONS  
During the course of the audit, the auditor may become aware of significant transactions that 
are outside the normal course of the entity’s business or appear unusual given the auditor’s 
understanding of the entity’s operations. The auditor should gain an understanding of the 
business rationale for these transactions and whether the rationale (or lack thereof) suggests 
the transactions may have been entered into to engage in fraudulent financial reporting or to 
conceal misappropriation of assets. 
Some questions the auditor should consider include: 
• Are the transactions overly complex? 
• Has management discussed the transactions with the board of directors and audit 
committee? 
• Has management placed more emphasis on the need for a particular accounting 
treatment than on the underlying economics of the particular transaction? 
• Do the transactions involve unconsolidated, unrelated parties (including special purposes 
entities), or parties that do not have the substance or financial strength to support the 
transaction?
