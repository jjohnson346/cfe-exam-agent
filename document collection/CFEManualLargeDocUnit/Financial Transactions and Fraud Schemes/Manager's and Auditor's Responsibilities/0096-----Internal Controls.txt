Internal Controls 
Under Section 404 of the Act, and SEC Release Nos. 33-8238 and 34-47986, management’s 
responsibility pertaining to the company’s internal control over financial reporting has been 
increased substantially.  
 
DEFINING INTERNAL CONTROL 
Internal control over financial reporting (ICOFR) is defined as: 
 
“ A process designed … to provide reasonable assurance re garding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles….” 
 
Additionally, ICOFR is deemed to include all policies and procedures that: 
• “Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the [company]; 
• Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the [company] are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the [company]; and 
• Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition, use or disposition of the [company ’s] assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements.” 
 
Examples of internal controls covered by Section 404 and the related Releases and Standards 
include, but are not limited to: 
  
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.208                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• Controls over initiating, authorizing, recording, processing, reconciling, and reporting 
significant account balances, transactions, and disclosures included in the financial 
statements. 
• Controls related to the prevention, identification, and detection of fraud. 
• Controls related to initiating and processing of non-routing and non-systematic 
transactions. 
• Controls related to the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies.  
 
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL 
The provisions of Section 404 require management to acknowledge its responsibility for the 
ICOFR of the company and to assess the operating effectiveness of those controls. As a 
result, public companies must issue an additional internal control report within their annual 
report containing: 
• A statement of management’s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate 
ICOFR; 
• A statement identifying the framework that management used in conducting the 
assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s ICOFR; 
• Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s ICOFR as of the end of 
the company’s most recent fiscal year, including disclosure of any material weaknesses 
identified in the company’s ICOFR and an explicit statement as to whether the ICOFR 
is effective; and 
• A statement that the company’s independent auditor has issued an attestation report 
covering management’s assessment of the company’s ICOFR. The auditor’s attestation 
report must also be filed with the annual report.  
 
MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL 
In performing the ICOFR assessment, management must choose a suitable internal control 
framework against which to evaluate the design and effectiveness of the company’s ICOFR. 
The most commonly used model in the United States is the Internal Control—Integrated 
Framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the 
Treadway Commission, which provides five components of effective internal controls: 
• Control Environment 
• Control Activities 
• Risk Assessment 
• Information and Communication 
• Monitoring 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.209 
The COSO framework is discussed in more detail in the “Fraud Prevention Programs” 
chapter in the Fraud Prevention and Deterrence section of the Fraud Examiners Manual. 
Further detail on the Internal Control—Integrated Framework is also available at the COSO 
website (http://www.coso.org). 
  
Additionally, management must: 
• Determine which internal controls to test in performing the assessment, considering the 
significance of each control, both individually and in the aggregate; 
• Evaluate whether the failure of a control could result in a misstatement to the financial 
statements, the likelihood and magnitude of any resulting misstatement, and whether 
other controls are in place to mitigate this occurrence; 
• Determine which locations or business units to include in the assessment, if applicable; 
• Evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of the internal controls using the internal 
control framework chosen as a guide; 
• Evaluate the probability of occurrence and the size of potential misstatements resulting 
from the internal control deficiencies identified and determine whether they, either 
individually or in the aggregate, constitute material weaknesses (any deficiency where the 
likelihood of potential misstatement is more than remote) or significant deficiencies (any 
deficiency where the likelihood of potential misstatement is more than remote and the 
magnitude is more than inconsequential); 
• Provide sufficient documentation to support the assessment of ICOFR, including 
documenting the design of the internal controls and the results of management’s testing 
and evaluation; and 
• Communicate the assessment findings to the independent auditor and any other 
applicable parties. 
 
Recognizing that each company differs with regard to internal control structure, the rules 
state that the nature of the testing performed by management will depend on the specific 
circumstances of the company and the significance of the control being tested. However, the 
rules also assert that inquiries alone are generally not a sufficient basis for management’s 
assessment.  
 
In July 2007, the SEC issued guidance specifically  addressed to management about fulfilling 
their responsibilities pertaining to reporting on internal control over financial reporting. The 
guidance emphasizes a top-down, risk-based approach to management’s evaluation of 
ICOFR, and explicitly states that an evaluation performed in compliance with the guidance is

one way that management can satisfy the internal control requirements established by 
Sarbanes-Oxley. In providing direction to assist companies’ management in evaluation and 
assessment of the ICOFR, the Guidance addresses the following topics: 
• Identifying Financial Reporting Risks and Controls 
• Evaluating Evidence of the Operating Effectiveness of ICOFR 
• Reporting Considerations
