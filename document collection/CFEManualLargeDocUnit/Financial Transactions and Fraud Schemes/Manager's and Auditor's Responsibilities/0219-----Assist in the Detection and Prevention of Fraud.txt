Assist in the Detection and Prevention of Fraud 
Because of their education, experience, and training, Certified Fraud Examiners are uniquely 
qualified to assist companies with proactive fraud prevention and detection programs. 
Certified Fraud Examiners assist in the investigation of fraud allegations and also aid 
management with designing and implementing internal control systems so that fraud 
schemes will be less common and not go undetected. 
 
It is common for a Certified Fraud Examiner to hold another designation, such as Certified 
Public Accountant, Certified Protection Professional, or Certified Internal Auditor. Dealing 
with accounting and auditing matters often requires the opinions of these professionals. 
Although Certified Fraud Examiners might hold other designations, they are bound by the 
Certified Fraud Examiner Code of Professional Ethics, which specifically states, in part: 
 
A Certified Fraud Examiner, when conducting examinations, will obtain  evidence or other 
documentation to establish a reasonable basis for any opinion required. No opinion shall be 
expressed regarding the guilt or innocence of any person or party. 
 
This article means that the Certified Fraud Examiner will not express an opinion, even if 
personally convinced of the guilt of an individual. Determining the guilt or innocence of an 
individual is reserved for a judge and jury; the Certified Fraud Examiner is a gatherer of 
facts, not the ultimate judge of them.

SAMPLE DOCUMENT RETENTION POLICY 
 
This is only a SAMPLE DOCUMENT RETENTION POLICY (DRP), and is NOT LEGAL 
ADVICE. It is only an example of a general DRP and should not be used without revision to meet the 
particular administrative and legal needs of your organi zation. There are many federal, state, and local laws 
that require organizations to retain documents for a certain period of time that may not be represented in this 
sample policy. All companies should contact counsel licensed to practice law in their state before implementing 
a DRP. 
 
I. Purpose  
 
To ensure the most efficient and effective operation of ORGANIZATION (Organization), we are 
implementing this Document Retention Policy (DRP or policy). The records of Organization and its 
subsidiaries are important to the proper functioning of Organization. Our records include virtually all 
of the records you produce as an Organization employee. Such records can be in electronic or paper 
form. Thus, items that you may not consider important, such as interoffice e-mails, desktop 
calendars, and printed memoranda are records that are considered important under this policy. If you 
are ever uncertain as to any procedures set forth in this policy (e.g., what records to retain or destroy, 
when to do so, or how to do so) it is your responsibility to seek answers from Organization’s DRP 
Manager. 
 
The goals of this DRP are to: 
 
1. Retain important documents for reference and future use; 
2. Delete documents that are no longer necessary for the proper functioning of Organization; 
3. Organize important documents for efficient retrieval; and 
4. Ensure that you, as an Organization employee, know what documents should be retained, 
the length of their retention, means of storage, and when and how they should be destroyed. 
 
Federal and state laws require Organization to maintain certain types of records for particular 
periods. Failure to maintain such records could subject you and Organization to penalties and fines, 
obstruct justice, spoil legal evidence, and/or seriously harm Organization’s position in litigation. 
Thus, it is imperative that you fully understand and comply with this, and any future records 
retention or destruction policies and schedules, UNLESS you have been notified by Organization, or 
if you believe that (1) such records are or could be relevant to any future litigation, (2) there is a 
dispute that could lead to litigation, or (3) Organization is a party to a lawsuit, in which case you 
MUST PRESERVE such records until Organization’s legal counsel determines that the records are 
no longer needed.  
 
“Records” discussed herein refers to all business records of Organization (and is used 
interchangeably with “documents”), including written, printed, and recorded materials, as well as 
electronic records (i.e., e-mails and documents saved electronically). All business records shall be 
retained for a period no longer than necessary for the proper conduct and functioning of 
Organization. No business records shall be retained longer than five (5) years, EXCEPT  those that 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.261 
(1) have time periods provided for herein, (2) are in the Document Retention Schedule, found at 
Appendix “A,” or (3) are specifically exempted by Organization’s DRP Manager.  
 
II. Management  
 
To ensure compliance with this DRP, Organization’s DRP Manager is responsible for the following 
oversight functions: 
 
• Implementing the DRP; 
• Ensuring that employees are properly educated, understand, and follow the DRP’s purpose; 
• Providing oversight on actual retention and destruction of documents;  
• Ensuring proper storage of documents; 
• Periodically following-up with counsel to ensure proper retention periods are in place;  
• Ensuring the proper storage of documents; 
• Suspending the destruction of documents upon foreseeable litigation; and 
• Keeping corporate officers, directors, and employees informed of changes in relation to the 
DRP. 
 
Organization’s DRP Manager shall annually review the DRP, modify it accordingly, and inform and 
educate all Organization employees on any such changes. All questions relating to document 
retention and/or destruction should be directly addressed to Organization’s DRP Manager. 
 
III. Types of Records 
 
Appendix “A,” attached at the end of this DRP, lists several categories of records, as well as specific 
records that contain specific retention periods. This is referred to as a Document Retention Schedule 
(DRS). All records not provided for in the DRS or described herein, shall be classified into three 
types: (1) Temporary Records, (2) Final Records, and (3) Permanent Records. 1   
 
Temporary Records 
 
Temporary records consist of all business documents that have not been completed, including, but 
not limited to: written memoranda and dictation to be typed in the future; reminders; to-do lists; 
report, case study, and calculation drafts; interoffice correspondence regarding a client or business 
transaction; and running logs. 
 
Temporary records can be destroyed, or permanently deleted if in electronic form (see protocol 
below for proper destruction of data in electronic form), when a project/case/file closes. Upon the 
closing of a project/case/file, gather and review all such temporary records. Before you destroy or 
permanently delete these documents, make sure you have duplicates of all the final records pertaining

Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.262                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
to the project/case/file. Upon destruction or deletion, organize the final records (and duplicates) in a 
file marked “FINAL” and store them appropriately. 
 
Final Records 
 
Final records include all business documents that are not superseded by modification or addition, 
such as, but not limited to: documents given (or sent via electronic form) to any third-party not 
employed by Organization or government agency, final memoranda and reports, correspondence, 
handwritten telephone memoranda not further transcribed, minutes, design/plan specifications, 
journal entries, and cost estimates. All accounting records shall be deemed final. 
 
Except as provided for in the DRS, all final documents are to be discarded 10 years after the close of 
a project/case/file. 
 
Permanent Records 
 
Permanent records include all business documents that define Organization’s scope of work, 
expressions of professional opinions, research, and reference materials, and include, but are not 
limited to: contracts, proposals, materials referenc ing expert opinions, annual financial statements, 
federal tax returns, payroll registers, copyright registration, and patents.  
 
Except as provided for in the Document Retention Schedule (Appendix “A”), all permanent 
documents are to be retained indefinitely. 
 
Accounting and Corporate Tax Records 
 
Accounting and corporate tax records include, but are not limited to: financial statements; ledgers; 
audit records; invoices and expense records; federal, state, and property tax returns; payroll; 
accounting procedures; gross receipts; customer records; and purchases.  
 
Unless otherwise specified in the DRS, such records should be retained for a minimum of six years 
or until the statute of limitations for a particular record expires (please consult Organization’s counsel 
for time periods if you manage/control such records). 
 
Workplace Records 
 
Workplace records include, but are not limited to: Articles of Incorporation; bylaws; meeting 
minutes; deeds and titles; leases; policy statements; contracts and agreements; and patents and 
trademark records.  
 
Unless otherwise specified in the DRS, such records should be retained in perpetuity. 
 
 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.263 
Employment, Employee, and Payroll Records 
 
Employment records include, but are not limited to: job announcements and advertisements, 
employment applications, background investigations, resumes, and letters of recommendation for 
persons not hired.  
 
Unless otherwise specified in the DRS, such records should be retained for a minimum of one year. 
 
Employee records include, but are not limited to: employment applications, background 
investigations, resumes, and letters of recommendation of current and past employees; and records 
relating to current and past employees’ performance reviews and complaints.  
 
Unless otherwise specified in the DRS, such records should be retained for a minimum of three years 
following unemployment with Organization. 
 
Payroll records include, but are not limited to: wage rate tables; salary histor y; current rate of pay; 
payroll deductions; time cards; forms W-2 and W-4; and bonuses.  
 
Unless otherwise specified in the DRS, such records should be retained for a minimum of six years. 
 
Bank Records 
 
Bank records include, but are not limited to: bank deposits, check copies, stop payment orders, bank 
statements, check signature authorizations, and bank reconciliations.  
 
Unless otherwise specified in the DRS, such records should be retained for a minimum of three 
years. 
 
Legal Records  
 
Legal records include, but are not limited to: a ll contracts; all legal records, statements, and 
correspondence; trademark and copyright registrations; patents; personal injury records and 
statements; press releases; and public findings.  
 
Unless otherwise specified in the DRS, such records should be retained for a minimum of 10 years. 
 
Historical Records 
 
Historical records are those that are no longer of use to Organization, but by virtue of their age or 
research value may be of historical interest or significance to Organization. Historical records should 
be retained indefinitely.

IV. Storage  
 
Tangible Records 
 
Tangible records are those which you must physically move to store, such as paper records (including 
printed versions of electronically saved documents), photographs, audio recordings, advertisements, 
and promotional items. Active records and records that need to be readily accessible may be stored in 
Organization’s office space or equipment. Inactive records can be sent to Organization’s off-site 
storage facility. 
 
Electronic Records 
 
Electronic mail (e-mail) should be either printed and stored as tangible evidence, or stored 
electronically.  
 
Organization has computer software that duplicates files, which are then backed up on central 
servers. If you have a notebook computer from Organization that you work on out of the office, 
your computer contains synchronization software that duplicates and backs up files when you log 
into the network. However, it is important that all employees take precautionary measures to save 
work and records on Organization’s network drive. 
 
V. Destruction / Deletion  
 
Tangible Records 
 
Tangible records should be destroyed by shredding or some other means that will render them 
unreadable. If you have a record that you do not know how to destroy, such as a photograph, 
compact disk, or tape recording, ask the advice of Organization’s DRP Manager.  
 
Electronic Records 
 
E-mail records that you “delete” remain in Organi zation’s system. Thus, Organization’s information 
technology (IT) department will be responsible for permanently removing deleted e-mails from the 
computer system. 
 
Deleting files and emptying the recycling bin is usually sufficient in most circumstances to get rid of a 
record. However, because electronic records can be stored in many locations, Organization’s IT 
department will be responsible for permanently removing deleted files from the computer system.  
 
Keep in mind, where duplicate records are involved, both must be destroyed/deleted where proper. 
 
 
 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.265 
VI. Cessation of Record  Destruction / Deletion 
 
If a lawsuit is filed or imminent, or a legal document request has been made upon Organization, ALL 
RECORD DESTRUCTION MUST CEASE IMMEDIATELY. Organization’s DRP Manager may 
suspend this DRP to require that documents relating to the lawsuit or potential legal issue(s) be 
retained and organized. A critical understanding of this section is imperative. Should you fail to 
follow this protocol, you and/or Organization may be subject to fines and penalties, among other 
sanctions.  
 
VII. Acknowledgement 
 
I have read and understand the purpose of this DRP. I understand that strict adherence to this DRP 
is a condition of my employment with Organization. If I do not understand something regarding this 
DRP, I will contact Organization’s DRP Manager im mediately for clarification. I agree to abide by 
Organization’s DRP.

SAMPLE DOCUMENT RETENTION SCHEDULE 
 
This is only a SAMPLE DOCUMENT RETENTION SCHEDULE (“DRS”), and is 
NOT LEGAL ADVICE. There are many federal, state, and local laws that require 
organizations to retain documents for a certain period  of time that may be different in your state (or 
different to your particular industry), or that may not be represented in this sample policy. All 
companies should contact counsel licensed to practice  law in their state for proper retention periods.
