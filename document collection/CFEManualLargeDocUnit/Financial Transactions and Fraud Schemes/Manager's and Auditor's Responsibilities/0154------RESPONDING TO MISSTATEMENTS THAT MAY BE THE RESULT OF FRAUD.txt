RESPONDING TO MISSTATEMENTS THAT MAY BE THE RESULT OF FRAUD 
If the auditor believes that misstatements are or may be the result of fraud, but the effect of 
the misstatements is not material to the financial statements, the auditor nevertheless should 
evaluate their implications. The auditor should be especially concerned with any implications 
pertaining to the “organizational position” of the person involved as they may require a 
reevaluation of the assessment of the risk of material misstatement. For example, in the 
event of theft of cash from a small petty cash fund, the amount of the theft generally would 
not be of significance to the auditor; however, if the theft was perpetrated by higher-level 
management, then it might be indicative of a more pervasive problem such as  
management integrity. 
 
If the auditor believes that a misstatement is or may be the result of fraud, and either has 
determined that the effect of the misstatement is material to the financial statements, or has 
been unable to evaluate whether the effect is material, the auditor should: 
• Attempt to obtain additional evidence to determine whether material fraud occurred and 
its effect on the financial statements; 
• Consider the implications for other aspects of the audit; 
• Discuss the matter and the approach for further investigation with an appropriate level 
of management that is at least one level above those involved, and with senior 
management and the audit committee; and 
• If appropriate, suggest the client consult with legal counsel.
