Auditors 
The Yellow Book stresses the importance of the auditors’ ethical responsibilities while 
conducting government audits, emphasizing that the public expects auditors in the 
government sector to conduct their professional work in accordance with ethical principles. 
To underscore this responsibility, GAGAS lay out five specific, overarching ethical 
principles that must guide the work of all auditors performing government audit 
engagements. 
 
THE PUBLIC INTEREST 
Serving the public interest and honoring the public trust are crucial components of the 
auditor’s responsibilities when performing en gagements in the government environment. 
GAGAS define the public interest as “the collective well-being of the community of people 
and entities the auditors serve.” 
 
INTEGRITY 
To strengthen the public confidence in the government, auditors must maintain the highest 
level of integrity when discharging their professional duties during a GAGAS engagement. 
This involves conducting the audit with an attitude that is “objective, fact-based, 
nonpartisan, and nonideological with regard to audited entities and users of the auditors’ 
reports.” Specifically, auditors are instructed to: 
• Ensure that all communications regarding the audit are honest, candid, and constructive;  
• Make decisions that are consistent with the public interest of the program or activity 
under audit; and

• Place priority on their responsibilities to the public interest in resolving any conflicting 
pressures that may arise during the audit engagement. 
 
OBJECTIVITY 
The auditor’s credibility in performing an audit of a governmental entity is based upon his 
ability to remain objective. GAGAS state that objectivity includes: 
• Being independent in fact and appearance; 
• Maintaining an attitude of impartiality; 
• Having intellectual honesty; and  
• Being free of conflicts of interest. 
 
PROPER USE OF GOVERNMENT INFORMATION, RESOURCES, AND POSITION 
During an audit of a governmental entity, the auditor must use all government information, 
resources, and positions for official purposes only. Auditors must not use their access to 
these assets for personal gain, in illegal manners, or to the detriment of the legitimate 
interests of the audited entity. 
 
PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR 
In conducting an audit or attestation engagement for a governmental entity, auditors must 
behave in a professional manner. This includes: 
• Complying with laws and regulations; 
• Avoiding any conduct that may discredit the auditors’ work; and 
• Putting forth an honest effort in performing their duties and professional services.
