Evaluating Audit Evidence 
ASSESSING RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT DUE TO FRAUD THROUGHOUT THE AUDIT 
During the performance of the audit, the auditor may identify conditions that either change 
or support a judgment regarding the assessment of risks. Examples include: 
• Discrepancies in the accounting records (e.g., transactions that are not recorded, 
unsupported or unauthorized balances or transactions, or last minute adjustments). 
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.232                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• Conflicting or missing evidential matter (e.g., missing or altered documents or records, 
unexplained items on reconciliations, or missing inventory). 
• Problematic or unusual relationships between the auditor and management (e.g., denial 
of access to records, facilities, employees, or customers; complaints by management 
about the conduct of the audit team; unusual delays in providing information; or 
unwillingness to add or revise disclosures). 
 
EVALUATING WHETHER ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES PERFORMED INDICATE A PREVIOUSLY UNRECOGNIZED RISK OF FRAUD 
Analytical procedures performed during the audit may result in identifying unusual or 
unexpected relationships that should be considered in assessing the risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. Determining whether a particular trend or relationship is a risk of 
fraud requires professional judgment. Unusual relationships involving year-end revenue and 
income often are particularly relevant and might include (1) uncharacteristically large 
amounts of income reported in the last week or two of the reporting period from unusual 
transactions and (2) income that is inconsistent with trends in cash flow from operations. 
 
Analytical procedures are useful because management or employees generally are unable to 
manipulate all the information necessary to produce normal or expected relationships. AU 
section 316 provides several examples, including the following: 
• The relationship of net income to cash flows from operations may appear unusual 
because management recorded fictitious revenues and receivables, but was unable to 
manipulate cash. 
• Changes in inventory, accounts payable, sales, or costs of sales from the prior period to 
the current period may be inconsistent, indicating a possible theft of inventory because 
the employee was unable to manipulate all of the related accounts. 
• An unexpected or unexplained relationship between sales volume as determined from 
the accounting records and production statistics maintained by operations personnel 
(which are more difficult for management to manipulate) may indicate a possible 
misstatement of sales. 
 
EVALUATING RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AT OR NEAR THE COMPLETION OF FIELDWORK 
At or near the completion of fieldwork, the auditor should evaluate whether the accumulated 
results of auditing procedures and other observations affect the assessment of risk of 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.233 
material misstatements due to fraud made earlier. Such an evaluation might identify whether 
there is a need to perform further audit procedures.  
 
RESPONDING TO MISSTATEMENTS THAT MAY BE THE RESULT OF FRAUD 
If the auditor believes that misstatements are or may be the result of fraud, but the effect of 
the misstatements is not material to the financial statements, the auditor nevertheless should 
evaluate their implications. The auditor should be especially concerned with any implications 
pertaining to the “organizational position” of the person involved as they may require a 
reevaluation of the assessment of the risk of material misstatement. For example, in the 
event of theft of cash from a small petty cash fund, the amount of the theft generally would 
not be of significance to the auditor; however, if the theft was perpetrated by higher-level 
management, then it might be indicative of a more pervasive problem such as  
management integrity. 
 
If the auditor believes that a misstatement is or may be the result of fraud, and either has 
determined that the effect of the misstatement is material to the financial statements, or has 
been unable to evaluate whether the effect is material, the auditor should: 
• Attempt to obtain additional evidence to determine whether material fraud occurred and 
its effect on the financial statements; 
• Consider the implications for other aspects of the audit; 
• Discuss the matter and the approach for further investigation with an appropriate level 
of management that is at least one level above those involved, and with senior 
management and the audit committee; and 
• If appropriate, suggest the client consult with legal counsel.
