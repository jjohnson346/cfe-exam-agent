Internal Auditor Responsibilities 
Internal auditors play a key role in helping organizations prevent and detect fraudulent 
activity. Because of their proximity to and understanding of the inner workings of the 
organization, internal auditors are in a unique position to uncover potential unscrupulous 
acts. In fact, the ACFE’s 2010 Report to the Nations on  Occupational Fraud and Abuse  shows that 
the internal audit function plays a vital role in detecting occupational frauds, accounting for 
the detection of 13.9 percent of the 1,843 cases included in the study. 
 
As part of its International Professional Practices Framework  (IPPF), The Institute of Internal 
Auditors (IIA) has developed the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal 
Auditing. This section includes those IIA standards that pertain to the internal auditor’s 
responsibilities for preventing, detecting, and assessing the risk of fraud within an 
organization. More detail on these and all other IIA standards can be found at the IIA’s 
website (www.theiia.org).    
 
Standard 1210—Proficiency 
Internal auditors must possess the knowledge, skills, and other competencies needed to 
perform their individual responsibilities. The internal audit activity collectively must possess 
or obtain the knowledge, skills, and other competencies needed to perform its 
responsibilities.  
 
1210.A2 
Internal auditors must have sufficient knowledge to evaluate the risk of fraud and the 
manner in which it is managed by the organization, but are not expected to have the 
expertise of a person whose primary responsibility is detecting and investigating fraud. 
 
Standard 1220—Due Professional Care 
Internal auditors must apply the care and skill expected of a reasonably prudent and 
competent internal auditor. Due professional care does not imply infallibility. 
 
1220.A1   
Internal auditors must exercise due professional care by considering the: 
• Extent of work needed to achieve the engagement’s objectives;  
• Relative complexity, materiality, or significance of matters to which assurance procedures 
are applied;  
• Adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management, and control processes;  
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.243 
• Probability of significant errors, fraud, or noncompliance; and     
• Cost of assurance in relation to potential benefits.  
 
1220.A3    
Internal auditors must be alert to the significant risks that might affect objectives, operations, 
or resources. However, assurance procedures alone, even when performed with due 
professional care, do not guarantee that all significant risks will be identified.  
 
Standard 2060—Reporting to Senior Management and the Board 
The chief audit executive must report periodically to senior management and the board on 
the internal audit activity’s purpose, authority, responsibility, and performance relative to its 
plan. Reporting must also include significant risk exposures and control issues, including 
fraud risks, governance issues, and other matters needed or requested by senior management 
and the board. 
 
Standard 2110—Governance
The internal audit activity must assess and make appropriate recommendations for 
improving the governance process in its accomplishment of the following objectives: 
• Promoting appropriate ethics and values within the organization; 
• Ensuring effective organizational performance management and accountability; 
• Communicating risk and control information to appropriate areas of the organization; 
and 
• Coordinating the activities of and communicating information among the board, external 
and internal auditors, and management.  
 
2110.A1    
The internal audit activity must evaluate the design, implementation, and effectiveness of the 
organization’s ethics-related objectives, programs, and activities. 
 
Standard 2120—Risk Management 
The internal audit activity must evaluate the effectiveness and contribute to the 
improvement of risk management processes. 
 
2120.A1 
The internal audit activity must evaluate risk exposures relating to the organization's 
governance, operations, and information systems regarding the: 
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.244                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• Reliability and integrity of financial and operational information;  
• Effectiveness and efficiency of operations; 
• Safeguarding of assets; and  
• Compliance with laws, regulations, and contracts.   
 
2120.A2 
The internal audit activity must evaluate the potential for the occurrence of fraud and how 
the organization manages fraud risk. 
 
Standard 2130—Control 
The internal audit activity must assist the organization in maintaining effective controls by 
evaluating their effectiveness and efficiency and by promoting continuous improvement. 
 
2130.A1 
The internal audit activity must evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls in 
responding to risks within the organization’s governance, operations, and information 
systems regarding the: 
• Reliability and integrity of financial and operational information; 
• Effectiveness and efficiency of operations; 
• Safeguarding of assets; and  
• Compliance with laws, regulations, and contracts. 
 
Standard 2210—Engagement Objectives 
Objectives must be established for each engagement. 
 
2210.A1 
Internal auditors must conduct a preliminary assessment of the risks relevant to the activity 
under review. Engagement objectives must reflect the results of this assessment. 
 
2210.A2 
Internal auditors must consider the probability of significant errors, fraud, noncompliance, 
and other exposures when developing the engagement objectives. 
     
IIA's IPPF—Practice Guide: Internal Auditing and Fraud  
To help auditors comply with their responsibilities pertaining to fraud, the IIA, in December 
of 2009, released IPPF—Practice Guide: Internal Auditing and Fraud  (Practice Guide). Although 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.245 
not mandatory, the guidance included in the Practice Guide is strongly recommended. 
Specifically, the Practice Guide addresses fraud awareness; potential fraud indicators; roles 
and responsibilities for fraud prevention and detection; the internal auditor’s role during 
audit engagements; fraud risk assessment; fraud prevention and detection; fraud 
investigation; and forming an opinion on internal controls related to fraud. The Practice 
Guide also includes an appendix that lists IPPF Practice Advisories that pertain to fraud. 
Following is a discussion of selected topics from the Practice Guide. The complete guide is 
available from the IIA’s website (www.theiia.org). 
 
Internal Audit's Role in Fighting Fraud 
Fighting fraud in an organization requires the combined efforts of many different 
departments, including internal audit. Internal auditors assist in the prevention and detection 
of fraud by evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls, assisting 
management in establishing effective fraud prevention measures, proactively auditing for 
fraud, and investigating suspected fraud. Specifically, the Practice Guide states that in 
conducting audit engagements, the internal auditor should: 
• Consider fraud risks in the assessment of internal control design and determination of 
audit steps to perform.  
• Have sufficient knowledge of fraud to identify red flags indicating fraud may have been 
committed. 
• Be alert to opportunities that could allow fraud, such as control deficiencies. 
• Evaluate whether management is actively retaining responsibility for oversight of the 
fraud risk management program, whether timely and sufficient corrective measures have 
been taken with respect to any noted control deficiencies or weaknesses, and whether 
the plan for monitoring the program continues to be adequate for the program’s ongoing 
success. 
• Evaluate the indicators of fraud and decide whether any further action is necessary or 
whether an investigation should be recommended. 
• Recommend investigation when appropriate.  
 
The role internal audit plays in fraud investigations varies by organization. Internal audit may 
have primary responsibility for fraud investigations, may serve as a resource for the 
investigations, or may have no involvement at all in the investigations. For internal auditors 
who find themselves involved in fraud investigations, the Practice Guide discusses the 
investigation process, the role of the internal auditor, conducting the investigation, reporting 
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.246                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
the investigation, resolution and communication of fraud incidents, and analysis of lessons 
learned. 
 
The Practice Guide also emphasizes that internal auditors must exercise professional 
skepticism — an attitude that includes a questioning mind and a critical assessment of audit 
evidence — in all audit work. By exercising professional skepticism and focusing on the 
effectiveness of internal controls, auditors increase the likelihood that they will uncover 
possible fraudulent activity. 
 
Other Roles and Responsibilities for Fraud Prevention and Detection 
Other typical roles and responsibilities for fraud detection and prevention outlined in the 
Practice Guide include the following: 
 
Board of directors — The board of directors is responsible for effective and responsible 
corporate fraud governance and is tasked with overseeing management’s actions to manage 
fraud risks. 
 
Audit committee — The audit committee’s role is to evaluate management’s identification of 
fraud risks and the implementation of anti-fraud measures, and to provide the tone at the 
top that fraud will not be accepted in any form. The audit committee is also responsible for 
overseeing controls to prevent or detect management fraud. 
 
Management — Management is responsible for overseeing the activities of employees, 
assessing the vulnerability of the entity to fraud, and establishing and maintaining an 
effective internal control system at a reasonable cost. 
 
Legal counsel — Legal counsel advises the organization on legal matters pertaining to fraud. 
 
External auditors — External auditors have a responsibility to comply with professional 
standards and to plan and perform the audit of the organization’s financial statements to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatements, whether caused by error or fraud. (For more information on the external 
auditor’s responsibilities for fraud, see the previous section “External Auditors.” 
 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.247 
Loss prevention manager—The loss prevention manager deals with crimes, disasters, 
accidents, waste, and other business risks, and usually works closely with internal auditors to 
identify areas of weak internal controls within the organization. 
 
Fraud investigators — Fraud investigators are responsible for detecting and investigating 
fraud, and recovering assets. 
 
Other employees — All employees have a responsibility to report suspicious activity to a 
hotline, the internal audit department, or management.
