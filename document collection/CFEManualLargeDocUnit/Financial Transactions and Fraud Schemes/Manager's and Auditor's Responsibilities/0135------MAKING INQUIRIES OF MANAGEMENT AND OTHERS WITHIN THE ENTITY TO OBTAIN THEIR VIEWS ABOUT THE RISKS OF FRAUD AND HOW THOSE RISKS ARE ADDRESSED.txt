MAKING INQUIRIES OF MANAGEMENT AND OTHERS WITHIN THE ENTITY TO OBTAIN THEIR VIEWS ABOUT THE RISKS OF FRAUD AND HOW THOSE RISKS ARE ADDRESSED 
This step involves asking management about a number of issues, including: 
• Whether management has knowledge of fraud or suspected fraud; 
• Management’s understanding of the risks of fraud; 
• Programs and controls the entity has established to help prevent, deter, or detect fraud; 
and 
• Whether and how management communicates to employees its views on business 
practices and ethical behavior. 
 
The auditor should also question the audit committee directly about its views concerning the 
risks of fraud and whether the committee has knowledge of fraud or suspected fraud. The 
same should be done with the company’s internal audit department.

Additionally, the auditor may need to conduct similar inquiries of the entity’s other 
personnel if the auditor believes they may have additional information about the risks of 
fraud.
