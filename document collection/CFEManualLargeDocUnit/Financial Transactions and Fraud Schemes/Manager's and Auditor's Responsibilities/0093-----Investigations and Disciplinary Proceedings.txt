Investigations and Disciplinary Proceedings 
The Board has the authority to investigate registered public accounting firms (or their 
employees) for potential violations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, professional standards, any 
rules established by the Board, or any securities laws relating to the preparation and issuance 
of audit reports. During an investigation, the Board has the power to compel testimony and 
document production.  
 
The Board also has the power to issue sanctions for violations or for non-cooperation with 
an investigation. Sanctions can include temporary or permanent suspension of a firm’s 
registration with the Board (which would mean the firm could no longer legally audit 
publicly traded companies), temporary or permanent suspension of a person’s right to be 
associated with a registered public accounting firm, prohibition from auditing public 
companies, and civil monetary penalties of up to $750,000 for an individual and up to 
$15,000,000 for a firm.
