Criminal Sanctions 
Section 1107 of the Act establishes criminal sanctions for anyone who intentionally retaliates 
against another party for providing information regarding an alleged Federal offense to a law 
enforcement officer. Punishments for violating the provision include fines of up to $250,000 
and up to 10 years in prison for individuals and fines of up to $500,000 for corporations. 
Unlike the civil liability, the protection provided under Section 1107 applies to all individuals, 
regardless of where they work.  
 
The whistleblower protection provisions are discussed in more detail in the “Law Related to 
Fraud” chapter in the Law section of the Fraud Examiners Manual.
