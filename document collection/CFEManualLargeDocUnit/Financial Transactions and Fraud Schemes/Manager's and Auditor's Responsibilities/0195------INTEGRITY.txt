This involves conducting the audit with an attitude that is “objective, fact-based, 
nonpartisan, and nonideological with regard to audited entities and users of the auditors’ 
reports.” Specifically, auditors are instructed to: 
• Ensure that all communications regarding the audit are honest, candid, and constructive;  
• Make decisions that are consistent with the public interest of the program or activity 
under audit; and
