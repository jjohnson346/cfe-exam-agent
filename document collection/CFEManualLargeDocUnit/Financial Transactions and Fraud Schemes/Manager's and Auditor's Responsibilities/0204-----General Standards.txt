General Standards 
The following general standards, coupled with the ethical principles outlined above, establish 
a foundation for credibility of auditors’ work.  
 
INDEPENDENCE 
Both the audit organization and the individual auditor must remain independent in both fact 
and appearance throughout the engagement so that all opinions, conclusions, judgments, and 
recommendations made by the auditor will be impartial and will be viewed as impartial by 
knowledgeable third parties. In determining independence, auditors must consider three 
types of potential impairments— personal impairments, such as family relationships, financial 
interests, or biases; external impairments  arising from actual or perceived pressures from the 
audited organization’s management or employees; and organizational impairments, which occur 
when the audit function is organizationally located within the reporting line of the areas 
under audit or when the auditor is assigned or takes on responsibilities that affect operations 
of the area under audit. 
 
The performance of nonaudit services must also be considered when assessing auditor 
independence. Specifically, auditors must apply the following two principles in regard to 
maintaining independence while performing nonaudit services for an audited program or 
entity: 
• Audit organizations must not provide nonaudit services that involve performing 
management functions or making management decisions; and  
• Audit organizations must not audit their own work or provide nonaudit services in 
situations in which the nonaudit services are significant or material to the subject matter 
of the audits.

PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT 
The auditor must use professional judgment, including exercising professional skepticism 
and reasonable care, in planning, performing, and reporting the results of the audit or 
attestation engagement. In applying professional judgment, it is imperative that the auditor 
retain an attitude of professional skepticism, assuming that management is neither inherently 
honest nor inherently dishonest. Thus, auditors must approach the engagement with a 
questioning mind and a critical assessment of all evidence. The application of professional 
judgment also requires auditors to use their professional knowledge, skills, and experience to 
diligently gather information and objectively evaluate the sufficiency and appropriateness of 
evidence. 
 
COMPETENCE 
The staff assigned to an engagement must collectively possess adequate professional 
knowledge, skills, and experience to properly conduct the audit. The necessary competence 
includes knowledge of GAGAS and other applicable auditing and accounting standards; 
general knowledge of the organization’s operating environment; skills to communicate 
clearly and effectively, both orally and in writing; and any specific skills appropriate to the 
work being performed, such as statistical sampling skills or information technology skills. In 
order to maintain their professional competence, all auditors performing governmental 
audits must meet the continuing professional education requirements under GAGAS.  
 
QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE 
Audit organizations performing government audits must have an internal quality control 
system in place. This system is composed of the organization’s leadership, and its policies 
and procedures established to provide reasonable assurance that the organization is in 
compliance with all applicable audit standards. As part of the system, organizations should 
establish policies and procedures that collectively address: 
• Leadership responsibilities for quality of audit and attestation engagements; 
• Independence, legal, and ethical requirements;  
• Initiation, acceptance, and continuation of audit and attestation engagements;  
• Human resource issues;  
• Performance, documentation, and reporting of audit and attestation engagements; and 
• Monitoring of quality. 
 
Additionally, audit organizations conducting audits and attestations under GAGAS must 
have periodic external peer reviews of their auditing and attestation engagement practices at

least once every three years. In addition, the results of the most recent peer review should be 
made publicly available.
