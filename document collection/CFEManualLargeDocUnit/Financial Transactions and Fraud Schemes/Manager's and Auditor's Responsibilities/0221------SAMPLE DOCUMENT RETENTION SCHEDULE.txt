SAMPLE DOCUMENT RETENTION SCHEDULE 
 
This is only a SAMPLE DOCUMENT RETENTION SCHEDULE (“DRS”), and is 
NOT LEGAL ADVICE. There are many federal, state, and local laws that require 
organizations to retain documents for a certain period  of time that may be different in your state (or 
different to your particular industry), or that may not be represented in this sample policy. All 
companies should contact counsel licensed to practice  law in their state for proper retention periods.
