GAO Auditing Standards  
Standards for government auditors are fundamentally based on the generally accepted 
auditing standards (GAAS) set for auditors of public companies. However, for audits of 
government organizations, programs, activities, functions, and funds, the requirements of 
Government Auditing Standards, also known as the Yellow Book, go beyond GAAS. (The 
following discussion of the Yellow Book standards is based upon the July 2007 revision of 
the standards. For more information, please see the full text of the GAO standards, available 
at www.gao.gov.) 
 
Purpose and Applicability 
The Yellow Book provides generally a ccepted government auditing standards (GAGAS) that 
form a framework of guidance for auditors of government entities and entities that receive 
government awards. Audits performed using Yellow Book standards provide information 
that is used for oversight, accountability, and improvement of government programs and 
operations. By following the requirements and guidance contained in GAGAS, auditors 
perform their duties in a way that can lead to improved government management, better 
decision making and oversight, effective and efficient operations, and accountability for 
resources and results. 
 
The use of GAGAS standards is frequently required under specific laws, regulations, 
contracts, grant agreements, or policies. However, many auditors and organizations may 
voluntarily choose to adhere to the standards as well. As such, the standards in the Yellow 
Book apply to audits and attestation engagements of government entities, programs, 
activities, and functions, and of government assistance administered by contractors, 
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.248                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
nonprofit entities, and other nongovernmental entities when the use of GAGAS is required 
or is voluntarily followed. 
 
Ethical Principles in Government Auditing 
Management 
According to the Yellow Book, management is re sponsible for setting the ethical tone of the 
organization by: 
• Maintaining and demonstrating an ethical culture;  
• Clearly communicating expectations about acceptable behavior to employees; and 
• Creating an environment that reinforces and encourages ethical behavior throughout the 
organization.  
 
Auditors 
The Yellow Book stresses the importance of the auditors’ ethical responsibilities while 
conducting government audits, emphasizing that the public expects auditors in the 
government sector to conduct their professional work in accordance with ethical principles. 
To underscore this responsibility, GAGAS lay out five specific, overarching ethical 
principles that must guide the work of all auditors performing government audit 
engagements. 
 
THE PUBLIC INTEREST 
Serving the public interest and honoring the public trust are crucial components of the 
auditor’s responsibilities when performing en gagements in the government environment. 
GAGAS define the public interest as “the collective well-being of the community of people 
and entities the auditors serve.” 
 
INTEGRITY 
To strengthen the public confidence in the government, auditors must maintain the highest 
level of integrity when discharging their professional duties during a GAGAS engagement. 
This involves conducting the audit with an attitude that is “objective, fact-based, 
nonpartisan, and nonideological with regard to audited entities and users of the auditors’ 
reports.” Specifically, auditors are instructed to: 
• Ensure that all communications regarding the audit are honest, candid, and constructive;  
• Make decisions that are consistent with the public interest of the program or activity 
under audit; and 
  
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.249 
• Place priority on their responsibilities to the public interest in resolving any conflicting 
pressures that may arise during the audit engagement. 
 
OBJECTIVITY 
The auditor’s credibility in performing an audit of a governmental entity is based upon his 
ability to remain objective. GAGAS state that objectivity includes: 
• Being independent in fact and appearance; 
• Maintaining an attitude of impartiality; 
• Having intellectual honesty; and  
• Being free of conflicts of interest. 
 
PROPER USE OF GOVERNMENT INFORMATION, RESOURCES, AND POSITION 
During an audit of a governmental entity, the auditor must use all government information, 
resources, and positions for official purposes only. Auditors must not use their access to 
these assets for personal gain, in illegal manners, or to the detriment of the legitimate 
interests of the audited entity. 
 
PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR 
In conducting an audit or attestation engagement for a governmental entity, auditors must 
behave in a professional manner. This includes: 
• Complying with laws and regulations; 
• Avoiding any conduct that may discredit the auditors’ work; and 
• Putting forth an honest effort in performing their duties and professional services. 
 
Types of Government Audit Engagements 
The Yellow Book describes and promulgates standards for two types of audits that 
government and non-government audit organizations conduct: financial audits and 
performance audits. The Yellow Book also contains standards covering attestation 
engagements, such as examinations and reviews, and other non-audit services performed on 
government organizations and programs.  
 
Financial Audits 
Financial audits are defined as those audits that “provide an independent assessment of 
whether an entity’s reported financial condition, results, and use of resources are presented 
fairly in accordance with recognized criteria.” In addition to traditional financial statement 
audits, the Yellow Book also includes in this category those engagements for: 
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.250                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• Reporting on internal control, compliance with laws and regulations, and provisions of 
contracts and grant agreements as they relate to financial transactions, systems,  
and processes. 
• Providing special reports for specified elements, accounts, or items of a  
financial statement; 
• Reviewing interim financial information; 
• Issuing letters for underwriters or other requesting parties; 
• Reporting on the processing of transactions by service organizations; and 
• Auditing compliance with regulations relating to federal award expenditures and other 
governmental financial assistance in conjunction with or as a by-product of a financial 
statement audit. 
 
Performance Audits 
Performance audits are described in the Yellow Book as audits that “provide assurance or 
conclusions based on an evaluation of sufficient, appropriate evidence against stated criteria, 
such as specific requirements, measures, or defined business practices.” The objectives of 
these audits can vary, and may include the assessment of program economy, efficiency, or 
effectiveness; internal control; compliance; and prospective analyses. Additionally, a 
performance audit may cover more than one of these objectives.  
 
Attestation Engagements 
Attestation engagements can cover financial or non-financial information. These 
engagements involve expressing a specified level of assurance about the subject matter or 
assertion related to the subject matter depending on the users’ needs. There are three types 
of attestation engagements: 
• Examination, which involves expressing an opinion on “whether the subject matter is 
based on (or in conformity with) the criteria in all material respects or the assertion is 
presented (or fairly stated), in all material respects, based on the criteria.” 
• Review, consisting of expression of a conclusion about “whether any information came 
to the auditors’ attention that indicates that the subject matter is not based on (or not 
in conformity with) the criteria or the assertion is not presented (or not fairly stated) in 
all material respects based on the criteria.” 
• Agreed-upon procedures engagement, which involves performing specific procedures on 
the subject matter.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.251 
Audit Standards 
The Yellow Book sets out three types of government audit standards: general standards, field 
work standards, and reporting standards. The general standards apply to both financial and 
performance audits. However, GAGAS provide a separate set of field work and reporting 
standards for each type of government audit. Additionally, the Yellow Book provides a 
separate set of standards — general, field work, and reporting — for attestation engagements. 
The discussion below contains a brief overview of the Yellow Book standards for audit 
engagements.  
 
General Standards 
The following general standards, coupled with the ethical principles outlined above, establish 
a foundation for credibility of auditors’ work.  
 
INDEPENDENCE 
Both the audit organization and the individual auditor must remain independent in both fact 
and appearance throughout the engagement so that all opinions, conclusions, judgments, and 
recommendations made by the auditor will be impartial and will be viewed as impartial by 
knowledgeable third parties. In determining independence, auditors must consider three 
types of potential impairments— personal impairments, such as family relationships, financial 
interests, or biases; external impairments  arising from actual or perceived pressures from the 
audited organization’s management or employees; and organizational impairments, which occur 
when the audit function is organizationally located within the reporting line of the areas 
under audit or when the auditor is assigned or takes on responsibilities that affect operations 
of the area under audit. 
 
The performance of nonaudit services must also be considered when assessing auditor 
independence. Specifically, auditors must apply the following two principles in regard to 
maintaining independence while performing nonaudit services for an audited program or 
entity: 
• Audit organizations must not provide nonaudit services that involve performing 
management functions or making management decisions; and  
• Audit organizations must not audit their own work or provide nonaudit services in 
situations in which the nonaudit services are significant or material to the subject matter 
of the audits. 
 
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.252                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT 
The auditor must use professional judgment, including exercising professional skepticism 
and reasonable care, in planning, performing, and reporting the results of the audit or 
attestation engagement. In applying professional judgment, it is imperative that the auditor 
retain an attitude of professional skepticism, assuming that management is neither inherently 
honest nor inherently dishonest. Thus, auditors must approach the engagement with a 
questioning mind and a critical assessment of all evidence. The application of professional 
judgment also requires auditors to use their professional knowledge, skills, and experience to 
diligently gather information and objectively evaluate the sufficiency and appropriateness of 
evidence. 
 
COMPETENCE 
The staff assigned to an engagement must collectively possess adequate professional 
knowledge, skills, and experience to properly conduct the audit. The necessary competence 
includes knowledge of GAGAS and other applicable auditing and accounting standards; 
general knowledge of the organization’s operating environment; skills to communicate 
clearly and effectively, both orally and in writing; and any specific skills appropriate to the 
work being performed, such as statistical sampling skills or information technology skills. In 
order to maintain their professional competence, all auditors performing governmental 
audits must meet the continuing professional education requirements under GAGAS.  
 
QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE 
Audit organizations performing government audits must have an internal quality control 
system in place. This system is composed of the organization’s leadership, and its policies 
and procedures established to provide reasonable assurance that the organization is in 
compliance with all applicable audit standards. As part of the system, organizations should 
establish policies and procedures that collectively address: 
• Leadership responsibilities for quality of audit and attestation engagements; 
• Independence, legal, and ethical requirements;  
• Initiation, acceptance, and continuation of audit and attestation engagements;  
• Human resource issues;  
• Performance, documentation, and reporting of audit and attestation engagements; and 
• Monitoring of quality. 
 
Additionally, audit organizations conducting audits and attestations under GAGAS must 
have periodic external peer reviews of their auditing and attestation engagement practices at 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.253 
least once every three years. In addition, the results of the most recent peer review should be 
made publicly available.  
 
Field Work Standards for Financial Audits 
GAGAS field work standards for financial audits include the three generally accepted 
standards of fieldwork established by the AICPA, as well as five additional fieldwork 
standards.  
 
The three AICPA standards of fieldwork are as follows: 
• The auditor must adequately plan the work and must properly supervise any assistants. 
• The auditor must obtain a sufficient understanding of the entity and its environment, 
including its internal control to assess the risk of material misstatement of the financial 
statements whether due to error or fraud, and to design the nature, timing, and extent of 
further audit procedures. 
• The auditor must obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence by performing procedures 
to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion regarding financial statements under audit. 
 
The five additional fieldwork standards prescribed by GAGAS state that: 
• Auditors should communicate with the audited entity their understanding of the services 
to be performed for each engagement and document that understanding through a 
written communication. In their communications, auditors should specifically address 
their planned work and the level of assurance to be provided related to testing internal 
control over financial reporting and compliance with laws, regulations, and provisions of 
contracts or grant agreements. Auditors should also communicate any potential 
restrictions on the auditors’ reports in order to reduce the risk that the needs or 
expectations of the parties involved may be misinterpreted. 
• Auditors should evaluate whether the audited entity has taken appropriate corrective 
action to address findings and recommendations from previous engagements that could 
have a material effect on the financial statements. 
• Auditors should design the audit to provide reasonable assurance of detecting material 
misstatements resulting from violations of contract provisions or grant agreements that 
have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. If 
during the course of the audit, auditors become aware of indications of abuse that could 
have a material, indirect effect on the financial statements, auditors should apply audit 
procedures specifically directed to ascertain whether material abuse has occurred and the 
potential effect on the financial statements or other financial data significant to the audit 
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.254                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
objectives. However, because the determination of abuse is subjective, auditors are not 
required to provide reasonable assurance of detecting abuse. 
• When auditors identify problems such as internal control deficiencies, fraud, illegal acts, 
violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or abuse, they should plan 
audit procedures to develop an explanation of the criteria, condition, cause, and effect or 
potential effect of the problem to facilitate the achievement of the audit objectives.  
• Audit documentation should contain sufficient information to provide a clear 
understanding of the work performed, the audit evidence obtained and its source, and 
the conclusions reached. The audit documentation should enable an experienced auditor, 
having no previous connection with the audit, to understand from the documentation 
the nature, timing, extent, and results of the audit procedures performed, the conclusions 
reached on significant matters, and that the accounting records reconcile to the financial 
statements. The documentation should be completed prior to the issuance of the 
auditors’ report, and should also include evidence of supervisory review of the work 
performed, as well as any departures from GAGAS.  
 
Reporting Standards for Financial Audits 
For reporting standards for financial statement audits, GAGAS incorporate the following 
four AICPA generally accepted standards of reporting: 
• The auditors’ report must state whether the financial statements are presented in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 
• The auditors’ report must identify any circumstances in which GAAP was not 
consistently applied in the current period in relation to the preceding period.  
• Informative disclosures in the financial statements are considered reasonably adequate 
unless otherwise stated in the auditors’ report. 
• The auditors’ report must contain either an expression of opinion regarding the financial 
statements, taken as a whole, or an assertion that such an opinion cannot be expressed. 
If an overall opinion cannot be expressed, the reasons should be stated. In all cases 
where an auditor’s name is associated with financial statements, the report should 
contain a clear-cut indication of the character of the auditor’s work, if any, and the 
degree of responsibility the auditor is taking. 
 
GAGAS prescribe eight additional reporting standards for government financial audits. They 
are: 
• The auditors’ report should specifically state that the audit was performed in accordance 
with GAGAS. 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.255 
• The auditors’ report should either (1) describe  the scope of the auditors’ testing internal 
control over financial reporting and compliance with laws, regulations, and provisions of 
contracts or grant agreements, and present the results of those tests or an opinion, if 
sufficient work was performed, or (2) refer to separate reports containing that 
information. If a separate report is used, the auditors’ report should state that the 
separate report is an integral part of the audit and should be considered in assessing the 
results of the audit.  
• Auditors should report (1) significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal 
control, (2) all material instances of fraud and illegal acts, and (3) significant violations of 
contract provisions or grant agreements and abuse. In some situations, the auditors 
should report the occurrence of these problems directly to parties outside of the audited 
organization.  
• Auditors may add a separate paragraph or separate section of the auditors’ report to 
emphasize certain information that may be critical to the proper use and understanding  
of the audited financial statements. Examples of matters that require such emphasis may 
include significant uncertainties and catastrophic or unusual events.  
• Auditors have specific responsibilities related to potential material misstatements and 
restatements of previously-issued financial statements. In situations where auditors 
become aware of new information that previously issued financial statements were 
materially misstated and that management intends to restate and reissue the misstated 
financial statements, auditors should advise management to disclose the information and 
its impact on the financial statements to parties who rely on the financial statements. 
Additionally, the auditors must (1) evaluate the timeliness and appropriateness of 
management’s disclosure of the misstatements and the actions taken to correct the 
misstatements, (2) perform audit procedures sufficient to reissue or update the auditors’ 
report on the restated financial statements, and (3) report directly to appropriate officials 
when the audited entity does not take the necessary steps. 
• If the auditors’ report contains any disclosures regarding deficiencies in internal control, 
fraud, illegal acts, violations of contract provisions or grant agreements, or abuse, the 
report should also include the views of the organization’s responsible officials 
concerning the findings, conclusions, and recommendations, as well as any planned 
corrective actions. 
• If any pertinent information about the audited entity is prohibited by law or regulation 
from being disclosed to the general public, the auditors’ report should state the nature of 
the omitted information and the reason for its omission.  
• Government auditors should submit their audit reports to those charged with 
Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities Financial Transactions   
1.256                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
governance, to the appropriate officials of the audited organization, to the parties 
requiring or arranging for the audit, to officials with oversight authority for the 
organization, to parties who may be responsible for acting on audit findings and 
recommendations, and to others who are authorized to receive such reports. 
Nongovernment auditors should distribute the report according to applicable auditing 
standards, as well as the agreement reached with the party contracting the audit.  
 
Field Work Standards for Performance Audits 
The GAGAS field work standards for performance audits relate to planning the audit; 
supervising staff; obtaining sufficient, appropriate evidence; and preparing audit 
documentation: 
• Auditors must adequately plan and document the planning of the audit work. This 
includes assessing significance (defined as “the relative importance of a matter within the 
context in which it is being considered, including quantitative and qualitative factors”) 
and audit risk (defined as “the possibility that the auditors’ findings, conclusions, 
recommendations, or assurance may be improper or incomplete, as a result of factors 
such as evidence that is not sufficient and/or appropriate, an inadequate audit process, 
or intentional omissions or misleading information due to misrepresentation or fraud”) 
while defining the audit objectives, scope, and methodology. Additionally, as part of 
planning the engagement, auditors must: 
? Consider the nature and profile of the entity, as well as the needs of the users of the 
audit report; 
? Consider the entity’s internal control and information systems controls; 
? Consider all significant legal and regulatory requirements, contract provisions, grant 
agreements, and potential fraud and abuse affecting the audited entity;  
? Consider the results of previous audits and attestation engagements;  
? Identify potential criteria needed to evaluate the audit matters and potential sources 
of audit evidence based on the amount and type of evidence needed;  
? Consider relying on the work of other auditors and experts to help achieve audit 
objectives;  
? Assign staff and specialists with sufficient professional competence to perform the 
audit;  
? Identify other resources needed to complete the audit; 
? Communicate matters about the audit planning and performance to management 
officials; and  
? Prepare a written audit plan. 
Financial Transactions  Management’s and Auditors’ Responsibilities 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.257 
• Audit supervisors must properly supervise the audit staff, which involves providing 
guidance and direction to the staff, staying informed about significant problems 
encountered, reviewing the work performed, and providing effective on-the-job training. 
• Auditors must obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for 
the auditors’ findings, conclusions, and recommendations.  
• Auditors should prepare sufficiently detailed audit documentation to provide a clear 
understanding of the nature, timing, extent, and results of the work performed; the 
evidence obtained and its source; and the conclusions reached. 
 
Reporting Standards for Performance Audits 
The Yellow Book standards for performance audits relate to the form of the report, the 
report contents, and the report issuance and distribution: 
• Auditors should prepare audit reports communicating the results of each audit. The 
report should be written or presented in some other retrievable form, and should be 
appropriate for its intended use.  
• The auditors’ report should contain: 
? The audit objectives, scope, and methodology; 
? The audit results, including findings, conclusions, and recommendations; 
? A reference to compliance with GAGAS; 
? The views of responsible officials; and 
? The nature of any privileged and confidential information omitted, if applicable. 
• The reported findings should include any significant deficiencies in internal control, all 
material instances of fraud and illegal acts, significant violations of provisions of 
contracts or grant agreements, and significant abuse. 
• Government auditors should submit audit reports to those charged with governance, to 
the appropriate officials of the audited entity, and to the appropriate oversight bodies or 
organizations requiring or arranging for the audits. Auditors should also send copies of 
the reports to other officials who have legal oversight authority or who may be 
responsible for acting on audit findings and recommendations, and to others authorized 
to receive such reports.  
 
In addition to these standards, auditors should refer to AU 801 (SAS No. 74), Compliance 
Auditing Considerations in Audits of Governmental Entities and Recipients of Governmental Financial 
Assistance. This standard incorporates a discussion of responsibilities under certain laws and 
government bulletins, and auditors should know these requirements. A thorough review of 
this statement will provide additional guidance.
