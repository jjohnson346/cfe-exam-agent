Reverse Proof 
The examination of fraud matters is approached from two perspectives. To prove that a 
fraud has occurred, the proof must include attempts to prove it has not occurred. The reverse 
is also true. In attempting to prove fraud has not occurred, that proof must also attempt to 
prove that it has. The reason is that both sides of fraud must be examined. Under the law, proof 
of fraud must preclude any explanation other than guilt.
