Introduction to Fraud Examination


:


Intent — knowingly to commit a wrongful act or to achieve a purpose inconsistent with 
law or public policy 
• Disguise of purpose — falsities and misrepresentations employed to accomplish the 
scheme 
• Reliance — by the offender on the ignorance or carelessness of the victim 
• Voluntary victim action — to assist the offender 
• Concealment — of the offense 
 
Intent  
Intent must be shown in fraud matters. Intent rarely is self-evident, but must rather be 
demonstrated by showing a pattern of activity. Some of the more common ways to show 
intent include proof that the accused: 
• Had no legitimate motive for the activities 
• Repeatedly engaged in the same or similar activity of an apparent wrongful nature 
• Made conflicting statements 
• Made admissions 
• Acted to impede the investigation of the offense 
• Made statements the offender clearly knew to be false
