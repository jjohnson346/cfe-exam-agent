Elements of White-Collar Offenses 
While it is not possible or necessary to list every variation of white-collar crime and fraud, all 
have common elements, such as: 
• Intent — knowingly to commit a wrongful act or to achieve a purpose inconsistent with 
law or public policy 
• Disguise of purpose — falsities and misrepresentations employed to accomplish the 
scheme 
• Reliance — by the offender on the ignorance or carelessness of the victim 
• Voluntary victim action — to assist the offender 
• Concealment — of the offense 
 
Intent  
Intent must be shown in fraud matters. Intent rarely is self-evident, but must rather be 
demonstrated by showing a pattern of activity. Some of the more common ways to show 
intent include proof that the accused: 
• Had no legitimate motive for the activities 
• Repeatedly engaged in the same or similar activity of an apparent wrongful nature 
• Made conflicting statements 
• Made admissions 
• Acted to impede the investigation of the offense 
• Made statements the offender clearly knew to be false 
 
Disguise and Misrepresentation  
Misrepresentation usually is shown by the facts that the representation was made and that it 
was false, either by omission or commission. 
  
Voluntary Victim Action to Assist the Offender 
Proof that the victim assisted the offender usually is not difficult to obtain from the victim. 
It is important for the fraud examiner to ascertain the exact circumstances regarding the 
fraud from the victim, clearly drawing out what made the fraud possible. In the case of 
employee thefts, for example, the victim (the company) entrusted the care of assets to the 
subject. That fiduciary capacity must be established.  
 
Concealment 
Concealment is a cornerstone of fraud. As opposed to traditional crimes, where there is no 
effort to conceal, fraud perpetrators take steps to keep the victim ignorant. Acts in fraud

schemes designed to conceal include committing offenses too small to be recognized as 
fraud by the victim. In embezzlement cases, for example, the amount of money taken at any 
one time usually is small relative to the total company assets. By demonstrating a continuing 
pattern of thefts, the concealment aspect can be shown.  
 
To hide their actions, fraud perpetrators often create complex financial trails. The more 
obscure the act, the greater likelihood that it will not be detected. Some fraud cases involve 
fraudulent invoices and journal entries. Concealment in these types of cases often can be 
proven by the fact that the entries made had no purpose other than to conceal.
