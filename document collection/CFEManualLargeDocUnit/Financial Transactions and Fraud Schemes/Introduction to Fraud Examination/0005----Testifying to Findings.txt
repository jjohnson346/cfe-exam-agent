Testifying to Findings 
Once a fraud examination has been completed, the evidence assembled, and the written 
report prepared, the fraud examiner often is called upon to testify before judicial authorities 
regarding the findings. Fraud examiners are expected to testify truthfully to matters relevant 
to the examination and to do so in a clear, and succinct manner.
