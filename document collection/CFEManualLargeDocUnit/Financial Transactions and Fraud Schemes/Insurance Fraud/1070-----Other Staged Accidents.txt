Other Staged Accidents 
Two drivers purposely collide where they will not be observed. Additional damage may be 
added to the vehicles after impact. The cars are then driven to a road or highway and 
arranged so that the accident appears to have occurred there. The police are then notified. 
 
SWOOP AND SQUAT 
A victim of this scheme will find himself passed by two cars while driving. The car in the 
lead will cut in front of the second, forcing it to stop abruptly. The victim rear-ends the 
second car while the other driver speeds away. Victims usually accept responsibility for the 
accident, thinking it their fault for not paying attention. The rear-ended vehicle usually 
contains the maximum amount of passengers, all with injuries.
