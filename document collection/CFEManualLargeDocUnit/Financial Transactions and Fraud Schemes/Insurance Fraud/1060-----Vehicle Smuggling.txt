Insurance Fraud

Vehicle Smuggling 
This is a scheme that involves the purchase of a new vehicle with maximum financing. A 
counterfeit certificate of the vehicle’s title is made showing that it is free and clear. The 
vehicle is insured to the maximum, with minimum deductible theft coverage. It is then 
shipped to a foreign port and reported stolen. The car is sold at its new location and 
insurance is also collected for the “theft.”
