Computer-Generated Detection Reports 
Computers can be used to generate detection reports that provide the fraud examiner with 
good leads to possible fraud.  
 
Address Similarity Report 
Address similarity reports electronically compare multiple checks going to the same address. 
They are extremely useful because they might show a check defalcation or funds going to 
another insurance company, broker, or fictitious payee.

Downloading of Files 
Comparison of issue files to disbursement files can determine if funds are being used to 
place new policies by using the equity of old policies. For example, computer-assisted 
auditing tools and techniques (CAATTs) are used to download and compare electronic files, 
such as comparing the administrative file on group business to the Social Security file to 
determine if the company is paying out monthly payments on people who have passed away. 
 
Electronic Confirmations 
Mailed disbursements in force or lapsed premiums, change of address, etc., to verify that 
company records agree with policyholder records. 
 
Exception or Manual Override Reports 
Computerized reports that list all exceptions to normal electronic processing. All human 
intervention can appear on a periodic management information report and be test-checked 
by management. It is imperative that management review on an ongoing basis all exception 
reports for possible frauds.
