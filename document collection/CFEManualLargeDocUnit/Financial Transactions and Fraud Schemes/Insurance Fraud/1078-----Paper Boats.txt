Paper Boats 
A claim is filed for a boat that sank, but actually never existed. It is not difficult to register a 
boat that is based on a bill of sale. After a period of time, a loss is claimed for the sinking of 
the boat. It is difficult to prove that the boat didn’t exist or wasn’t sunk intentionally.
