GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF THE INSURED’S OPERATION 
Premium rates differ significantly based on geographic location from state to state. An 
employer might have a storefront location or a P.O. box in a state that has lower rates. A 
multistate employer may list all of its employees as operating in the state that has the lowest 
rates.
