Conspiracy to Defraud the United States, Title 18, U.S.C., § 371 
The criminal tax statutes of the Internal Revenue Code do not include a statute for the crime 
of conspiracy, but tax conspiracies can be prosecuted under the general conspiracy statute 
under section 371 of Title 18, U.S. Code. Section 371 makes it illegal for two or more 
persons to agree to commit an offense against the United States or to defraud any federal
