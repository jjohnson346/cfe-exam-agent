Hallmarks (Badges) of Fraud 
The courts recognize certain hallmarks or badges of tax fraud. Some of these are: 
• Misrepresentation of facts 
• Artifice 
• Device to hide income or assets 
• Double set of books 
• Secret bank accounts under false names 
• Overstatement of deductions 
• Fictitious transactions 
 
Fraud Is More Than a Mistake in Judgment  
The failure to know and understand the rules of “first in, first out” (FIFO) is not sufficient 
to sustain a fraud charge, Smith v. Commissioner, 40 BTA 387, supplemental opinion 42 BTA 
505. There was no indication in this case that the taxpayer misrepresented any fact, withheld 
any information, or resisted or prevented the discovery by the commissioner of any 
pertinent data. 
 
False Versus Fraudulent 
Definitions of False 
• When “false” appears by itself, and not coupled with a penalty or the creation of an 
offense, then false means incorrect [ Eliot National Bank v. Gill, 218 F. 600 (1st Cir 1914)]. 
• False means it is incorrect, but made in good faith [ National Bank of Commerce in St. Louis 
v. Allen, 223 F. 472 (8th Cir 1915)]. 
• Statements of opinion, as distinguished from those of material fact, are not fraud [ Ohio Brass 
Co. v. Commissioner, 17 BTA 1199 (1929)].

Corporate Fraud  
Corporate fraud  depends on the intent of the corporate officers [Auerbach Shoe Co. v. 
Commissioner, 21 TC 191 (1st Cir. 1953)]. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Charging airline tickets to “air freight” (a false representat ion) coupled with the failure to 
credit refunds for redeemed tickets to the corp oration was sufficient to render the corporate 
returns fraudulent [ Kreps v.  Commissioner, 42 TC 660 (1964) aff’d, 351 F.2d 1 
(2nd Cir 1965)]. 
 
EXAMPLE 
A 40 percent shareholder/officer of a corporation embezzled corporate funds for her 
personal use, then falsified corporate records.  The corporation incorrectly claimed deductions 
based on the false records. The fraud claim was not sustained against the corporation 
[Botwinik Bros. of Mass., Inc. v. Commissioner, 39 TC 988 (1963)]. 
 
Burden of Proof  
In July of 1998, President Clinton signed in to law the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act. 
This Act made sweeping changes in the structure and procedures of the IRS. One of the 
most important changes involves the shift of the burden of proof in civil cases. The general 
rule prior to the Act was that the taxpayer bears the burden of proof at trial in civil 
proceedings. The Statutory Notice of Deficiency (90-day letter) enjoyed the presumption of 
correctness. The presumption of correctness in favor of the IRS required the taxpayer to go 
forward with prima facie evidence to disprove the IRS’s determination. After successfully 
rebutting the presumption of correctness, taxpayers had the burden of proving their case by 
at least a preponderance of the evidence.  
 
However the rule established under the Reform Act is that IRS has the burden of proof in 
civil court proceedings on income, gift, estate, or generation-skipping tax liability with 
respect to factual issues that are relevant to determining the taxpayer’s tax liability, provided 
the taxpayer: (1) provides credible evidence on the factual issue; (2) keeps records and backs 
up items as presently required under the Code and regulations; and (3) cooperates with IRS 
in regard to reasonable requests for meetings, interviews, witnesses, information, and 
documents. Corporations, trusts, and partnerships with a net worth in excess of $7 million 
continue to bear the burden of proof. The Senate Finance Committee Report states that if

the taxpayer’s evidence and the IRS’s evidence are equally balanced, the court should find 
that the IRS has not sustained its burden of proof.  
 
Fraud 
Even under the old IRS Code, there was no presumption of correctness afforded the IRS 
when fraud was involved. Therefore, the IRS had the burden of proving fraud [ Armstrong v. 
U.S., 354 F.2d 274; 173 Ct.Cl. 944 (1965)]. If the fraud claim is for more than one year, the 
IRS must show that some part of the underpayment was due to fraud for each year that the 
penalty is added [Professional Services v. Commissioner, 79 TC 888 (1982)]. First, there must be a 
deficiency and second, the deficiency must be substantial [U.S. v. Morse, 491 F.2d 149 (1st Cir 
1974)]. Substantiality  is a question of fact [U.S. v. Marks, 282 F. Supp. 546 (D Or 1966), aff’d  
391 F.2d 210; (9th Cir 1968); cert denied 39 3 U.S. 839 (1968)]. There is controversy about 
whether substantiality applies to the unpaid tax or to unreported income. Fraud penalties 
survive the death of the taxpayer.
