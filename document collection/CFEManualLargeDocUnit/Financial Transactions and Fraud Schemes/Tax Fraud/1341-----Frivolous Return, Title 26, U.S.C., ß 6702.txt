Frivolous Return, Title 26, U.S.C., § 6702 
If a taxpayer files a frivolous return — one that is incorrect on its face or one that does not 
contain enough information to determine the tax liability — the government may impose a 
separate $5,000 civil penalty. An example of a frivolous return is one written in Roman 
numerals rather than Arabic numbers.
