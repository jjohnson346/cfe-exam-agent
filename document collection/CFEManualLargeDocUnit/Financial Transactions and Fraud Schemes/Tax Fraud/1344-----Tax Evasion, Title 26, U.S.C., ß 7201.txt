Tax Evasion, Title 26, U.S.C., § 7201 
If a taxpayer is found guilty of tax evasion, which is the intentional evasion of tax 
obligations, the government shall impose a penalty of not more than $100,000 ($500,000 in 
the case of a corporation) and/or imprisonment for not more than five years.  
 
There are three elements to the crime of tax evasion. 
 
WILLFULNESS 
A willful and positive attempt to evade or defeat the tax in any manner lifts a misdemeanor to 
a felony [Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943)]. A consistent pattern of not reporting or

underreporting income is sufficient to infer willfulness [United States v. Stone, 770 F.2d 842 (9th 
Cir 1985)]. 
 
EXISTENCE OF A SUBSTANTIAL DEFICIENCY 
There must be a deficiency and that deficiency must be substantial [Lawn v. United States, 355 
U.S. 339. Morse, supra]. Therefore, there must also be a tax liability [§ 7202. But see Marks, 
supra]. 
 
AFFIRMATIVE ACT 
There must be an affirmative act constituting an evasion or attempted evasion of tax 
obligations, but to be found guilty of this felony, one needs only to attempt to evade the tax.
