Introduction 
The most important distinction in determining whether an individual or company has 
committed tax fraud is whether the tax-filing party intentionally filed an improper tax return 
with the federal government. The intent of the party to wrongly file a return will determine 
the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion. The U.S. courts have determined evasion 
to be unlawful, while avoidance has been deemed lawful. 
 
The definition of tax fraud is 
 
… the actual intentional wrongdoing, and the intent required … to evade a tax believed to 
be owing. Fraud implies bad faith, intentional wrongdoing, and a sinister motive. It is 
never imputed or presumed and the courts will not sustain findings of fraud upon 
circumstances which at most create only suspicion.    
 
This definition tells us that a false tax return is considered fraudulent if the responsible party 
has knowingly attempted to defraud the government of owed tax dollars. In U.S. v. 
Pomponio, the courts further refined the scope of tax fraud by stating that willfulness is “… a 
voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty, [that] does not require proof of an evil 
motive.” It can thus be accepted that accidental false tax returns do not qualify as fraudulent 
returns.  
 
Fraudulent Intent  
An example of fraudulent intent is the filing of a tax return in the wrong district, when the 
taxpayer (a CPA) knew or had reason to know the proper district (Spencer D. Lorton v. 
Commissioner, TC Memo 1954–872). 
 
Objectively Reasonable “Good Faith” Misunderstanding of the Law  
Good faith or a legitimate misunderstanding of the requirements of the law negates 
willfulness, [ U.S. v. Cheek, 931 F.2d 1206 (7th Cir 1991), aff’d. 111 U.S. 604 (1991)]. The case 
held, however, that the belief that taxes are in violation of the Constitution was not 
“objectively reasonable” so as to negate willfulness.

Willfulness can be inferred from conduct, such as: 
• Keeping a double set of books (not to be confused with GAAP and tax records). 
• Making false entries or alterations or creating false invoices or documents. 
• Destruction of books or records. 
• Concealment of assets (illicit income). 
• Covering up sources of income. 
• Avoiding making records usual in transactions of the kind. 
• Conduct that misleads or conceals [ Spies v. U.S., 317 U.S. 492 (1943).].
