Tax Fraud

Direct Evidence 
Certain circumstances constitute direct evidence of tax fraud, including: 
• Unexplained bank deposits (e.g., using bank accounts in another person’s name or a 
fictitious name) 
• Submission of false documents (e.g., if a taxpayer claims medical deductions but cannot 
provide any evidence that he had seen or paid the bills) 
• False explanations for prior conduct (e.g., the taxpayer destroyed his company’s cash 
register tapes, which were the only records for the company’s sales) 
• Participation in an illegal business (e.g., over several years, a taxpayer who ran an illegal 
lottery substantially underreported his income) 
• False claims of extra withholding exemptions (e.g., a taxpayer claimed 50 withholding 
exemptions, but could not substantiate that he was entitled to claim them)
