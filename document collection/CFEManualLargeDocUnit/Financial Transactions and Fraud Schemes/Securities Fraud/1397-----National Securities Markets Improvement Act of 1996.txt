National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996  
The most significant federal legislative development in securities regulation in recent years is 
the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996. Often referred to as NSMIA 
(pronounced “nismia”), it is an attempt to standardize securities regulation in the United 
States and use federal law to preempt some of the state requirements. Essentially, the 
authority of a state to require registration of certain securities or control certain transactions 
has been removed. 
 
Three main changes that are of particular importance: 
• So called “covered securities” are no longer regulated by the states. A state cannot 
require registration of securities that are deemed covered. Essentially these are securities 
listed on the major exchanges, mutual funds, and certain private placements.  
• Previously all individuals and companies offering investment advice came under state 
jurisdiction. Now only those with assets of less than $25 million fall under state 
regulation. 
• Although NSMIA significantly reduces the enforcement powers of states in several areas, 
a state can still take action in cases involving fraud.
