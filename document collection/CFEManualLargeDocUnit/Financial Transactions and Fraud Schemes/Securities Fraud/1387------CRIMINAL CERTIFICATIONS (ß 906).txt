CRIMINAL CERTIFICATIONS (§ 906) 
Periodic filings with the SEC must now be accompanied by a statement, signed by the CEO 
and CFO, which certifies that the report fully complies with the SEC’s periodic reporting 
requirements and that the information in the report fairly presents, in all material respects, 
the financial condition and results of operation of the company. 
These certifications are known as “criminal certifications” because the Act imposes criminal 
penalties on officers who violate the certification requirements.  
• Corporate officers who knowingly  violate the certification requirements are subject to 
fines of up to $1,000,000 and up to 10 years imprisonment, or both.  
• Corporate officers who willfully violate the certification requirements are subject to fines 
of up to $5,000,000 and up to 20 years imprisonment, or both.
