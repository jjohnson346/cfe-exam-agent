Other Criminal Penalties  
SECURITIES FRAUD  
Section 807 of the Act makes securities fraud a crime under 18, U.S.C., § 1348, providing for 
fines up to $250,000 and up to 25 years in prison.  
 
SECURITIES FRAUD (TITLE 18, U.S. CODE, § 1348) 
Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts  to execute, a scheme or artifice — 
 
(1) to defraud any person in connection with any security of an issuer with a class of 
securities registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15, U.S.C., 
78l) or that is required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (15, U.S.C., 78o(d)); or 
 
(2) to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent  pretenses, representat ions, or promises, any 
money or property in connection with the purchase or sale of any security of an issuer with a 
class of securities registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15, 
U.S.C., 78l) or that is required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15, U.S.C., 78o(d)); 
 
shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned not more than 25 years, or both. 
 
DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION  
Section 802 of the Act makes destroying evidence to obstruct an investigation or any other 
matter within the jurisdiction of any U.S. department illegal and punishable by a fine of up to 
$250,000 and up to 20 years in prison.  
 
The final rules adopted by the SEC under section 802 specifically require that accountants 
who perform audits on publicly traded companies must maintain all audit or review work 
papers for a period of seven years. Although the original provisions of section 802 only 
Securities Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1512                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
required a retention period of five years, the SEC extended the requirement to be consistent 
with the seven-year retention period required under the Auditing Standards promulgated by 
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) per section 103 of the Act. 
Violations of the final SEC rules may be punished by fines up to $250,000 and up to 10 
years in jail for individuals, or fines up to $500,000 for corporations.  
 
Section 1102 of the Act amends § 1512 of the U.S. Code to make it a criminal offense to 
corruptly alter, destroy, mutilate or conceal a record or document with the intent to impair 
its integrity or use in an official proceeding, or to otherwise obstruct, influence, or impede 
any official proceeding or attempt to do so. Violations of this section are punishable by fines 
up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to 20 years.  
 
FREEZING OF ASSETS 
During an investigation of possible securities violations by a publicly traded company or any 
of its officers, directors, partners, agents, controlling persons, or employees, the SEC can 
petition a federal court to issue a 45-day freeze on “extraordinary payments” to any of the 
foregoing persons. If granted, the payments will be placed in an interest-bearing escrow 
account while the investigation commences. This provision was enacted to prevent 
corporate assets from being improperly distributed while an investigation is underway.  
 
BANKRUPTCY LOOPHOLES 
Section 803 amends the bankruptcy code so that judgments, settlements, damages, fines, 
penalties, restitution payments, disgorgement payments, etc., resulting from violations of 
Federal securities laws are non-dischargeable. This was intended to prevent corporate 
wrongdoers from sheltering their assets under bankruptcy protection.  
 
DISGORGEMENT OF BONUSES 
One of the most unique aspects of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is § 304, which states that if a 
publicly traded company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the 
company’s material noncompliance, as a result of “misconduct,” with any financial reporting 
requirement under securities laws, then the CEO and CFO must reimburse the company for: 
• Any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation received during the 
12 months after the initial filing of the report that requires restating; and  
• Any profits realized from the sale of the company’s securities during the same 12- 
month period. 
 
Financial Transactions  Securities Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1513 
While the Act requires the CEO and CFO to disgorge their bonuses if the company’s 
financial statements have to be restated because of “misconduct,” it makes no mention of 
whose misconduct triggers this provision. There is certainly nothing in the text of § 304 that 
limits the disgorgement provision to instances of misconduct by the CEO and CFO. 
Presumably, then, the CEO and CFO could be required to disgorge their bonuses and 
profits from the sale of company stock even if they had no knowledge of and took no part in 
the misconduct that made the restatement necessary.
