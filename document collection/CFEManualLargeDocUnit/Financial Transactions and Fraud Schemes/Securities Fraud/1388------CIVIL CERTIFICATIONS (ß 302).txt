CIVIL CERTIFICATIONS (§ 302) 
Section 302 of the Act requires the CEO and CFO to personally certify the following in 
their reports:  
• They have personally reviewed the report;  
• Based on their knowledge, the report does not contain any material misstatement that 
would render the financials misleading;  
• Based on their knowledge the financial information in the report fairly presents in all 
material respects the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow of the 
company;  
• They are responsible for designing, maintaining, and evaluating the company’s internal 
controls, they have evaluated the controls within 90 days prior to the report, and they 
have presented their conclusions about the effectiveness of those controls in the report; 
• They have disclosed to the auditors and the audit committee any material weaknesses in 
the controls and any fraud, whether material or not, that involves management or other 
employees who have a significant role in the company’s internal controls; and 
• They have indicated in their report whether there have been significant changes in the 
company’s internal controls since the filing of the last report. 
 
Note that in items 2 and 3 the CEO and CFO are not required to certify that the financials 
are accurate or that there is no misstatement. They are simply required to certify that to their 
knowledge  the financials are accurate and not misleading. However, this does not mean that 
senior financial officers can simply plead ignorance about their companies’ SEC filings in 
order to avoid liability. The term “fairly presents” in item 3 is a broader standard than what 
is required by GAAP. In certifying that their SEC filings meet this standard, the CEO and

CFO essentially must certify that the comp any (1) has selected appropriate accounting 
policies to ensure the material accuracy of the reports; (2) has properly applied those 
accounting standards; and (3) has disclosed financial information that reflects the underlying 
transactions and events of the company. Furthermore, the other certification rules (see 1, 
and 4–6 above) mandate that CEOs and CFOs take an active role in their companies’ public 
reporting, and in the design and maintenance of internal controls. 
 
It is significant that in item 4, the CEO and CFO not only have to certify that they are 
responsible for their companies’ internal controls, but also that they have evaluated the 
controls within 90 days prior to their quarterly or annual report.  Essentially, this certification 
requirement mandates that companies actively and continually re-evaluate their control 
structures to prevent fraud. 
 
In conjunction with the § 302 certification requirements on the responsibility of the CEO 
and CFO for internal controls, § 404 of the Act requires all annual reports to contain an 
internal control report that (1) states management’s responsibility for establishing and 
maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting; 
and (2) contains an assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and 
procedures of the company for financial reporting.  
 
Item 5 requires the CEO and CFO to certify that they have disclosed to their auditors and 
their audit committee any material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls, and also 
any fraud, whether material or not,  that involves management or other key employees. 
Obviously, this is a very broad reporting standard that goes beyond the “material” standard 
generally used in financial statement audits. The CEO and CFO now must report to their 
auditors and audit committee any fraud  committed by a manager. This places a greater burden 
on the CEO and CFO to take part in anti-fraud efforts and to be aware of fraudulent activity 
within their companies in order to meet this certification requirement.  
 
Item 6 is significant because periodic SEC filings must now include statements detailing 
significant changes to the internal controls of publicly traded companies.
