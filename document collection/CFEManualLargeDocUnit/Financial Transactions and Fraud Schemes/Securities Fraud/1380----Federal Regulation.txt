Federal Regulation 
 
Securities Act of 1933 
Concern over the 1929 stock market crash and over the manipulation of the securities 
markets precipitated the need for federal intervention. In 1933, the Securities Act was 
enacted to regulate the public offering of securities and protect investors. The 1933 Act, 
sometimes known as the “Truth in Securiti es Act,” defines securities to include: 
 
 “…any note, stock, treasury stock, bond, debenture, … investment contract, fractional 
undivided interest in any oil, gas or other mineral rights, any put, call, straddle, option … 
any interest or instrument commonly known as a security…” [Title 15, U.S.C., § 
77b(a)(1)].  
 
 
Securities Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1502                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Of course, both federal and state laws provide for exemptions. Exemptions basically fall 
under two categories, exempt securities and exempt transactions. For example, certain obligations 
issued or guaranteed by the United States government or by state or local governments are 
exempted securities.  
 
This Act also requires that investors be given full and fair disclosure of material information 
concerning their investment or prospective investment. In this way the sale of securities 
differs from many other commercial transactions where caveat emptor is the rule. Here, the 
investor is entitled to all information necessary for an informed investment decision to  
be made. 
 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
Unlike the 1933 Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 mainly deals with post-issuance 
trading. This Act, which gave birth to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), 
requires the registration of securities brokers and dealers. Simply put the 1933 Act can be 
thought of as regulating the issuance of the securities themselves, while the 1934 Act covers 
subsequent trading. This secondary market trading represents by far the greatest volume of 
securities transactions. Trading generally takes place on markets with actual trading floors, 
called “exchanges,” or on so-called “over-the-counter” markets such as NASDAQ. 
 
The 1934 Act contains section 10(b), a comprehensive anti-fraud provision, which permits 
the SEC to set forth rules and regulations that prohibit manipulative or deceptive devices or 
contrivances via the mails or other means of interstate commerce. For example, under 
section 10(b), the SEC promulgated Rule 10b-5, which prohibits false statements and other 
fraudulent activity in connection with securities transactions. Specifically, Rule 10b-5 states 
that:  
 
“It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or 
instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of any national 
securities exchange, 
 
(1)  to employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud, 
 
(2)  to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact 
necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under 
which they were made, not misleading, or 
Financial Transactions  Securities Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1503 
(3)  to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as 
a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any 
security.” 
 
Investment Advisor Act of 1940 
Registered securities dealers are required to adhere to the Rules of Fair Practice issued by the 
National Association of Securities Dealers and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. This 
Act mandates registration and regulation of investment advisers. It applies to anyone who 
advises others as part of a regular business and for compensation on the investment, 
purchase, or sale of securities. This does not apply to those who do not receive 
compensation or who publish financial advice in a newspaper or magazine. 
 
Investment Company Act of 1940 
Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, investment companies are required to register 
with the SEC, which also regulates their activities. This Act dictates qualifications for officers 
and directors, requires that certain matters are submitted for stockholder approval, and 
mandates SEC permission for certain transactions such as those between insiders and 
affiliates. It divides investment companies into three categories: 
• Face-amount certificate companies — Any comp any engaged in issuing fixed income 
debenture type securities. 
• Unit investment trusts—Companies organized under a trust indenture, contract of 
agency, or those similar in nature, which do not have a board of directors and issue only 
redeemable securities. 
• Management companies — Firms that do not fit the criteria of the first two categories fall 
into this one. This includes open and closed-end companies, whether listed on securities 
exchanges or not. “Open-end” companies are commonly referred to as mutual funds 
and the net asset value of a share is calculated based on the market value of the fund’s 
portfolio divided by the number of shares outstanding. The shares of “closed-end” 
companies trade in a similar manner to regular stocks, i.e., the value is determined by the 
market forces of supply and demand.  
 
Although there are criminal penalties attached to violations of the federal securities laws, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission does not have the power to take criminal action. SEC 
investigations that disclose potentially criminal violations are usually referred to the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation.  
 
Securities Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1504                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Less serious violations may be addressed using  the Commission’s administrative powers. The 
SEC has the power to issue “cease and desist” orders, levy fines, and order disgorgement  
of profits. 
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act  
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is one of the most significant changes in the securities field 
since the 1934 Act was passed. It was designed to restore investor confidence in capital 
markets and help eliminate financial statement fraud in publicly traded companies while at 
the same time significantly increasing the penalties for corporate accounting fraud.  
 
The most significant changes brought on by the Act include:  
• The creation of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
• Requirements for senior financial officers to certify SEC filings. 
• Standards for audit committee independence. 
• Standards for auditor independence. 
• Enhanced financial disclosure requirements. 
• Protections for corporate whistleblowers. 
• Enhanced penalties for white-collar crime. 
 
The Act is discussed in detail in the “Law Related to Fraud” chapter in the Law section of 
the Fraud Examiners Manual. However, some of the more important provisions as they relate 
to corporate governance are reproduced here. 
 
Certification Obligations for CEOs and CFOs 
One of the most significant changes effected by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is the requirement 
that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of public companies 
personally certify annual and quarterly SEC filings. These certifications essentially require 
CEOs and CFOs to take responsibility for their companies’ financial statements and prevent 
them from delegating this responsibility to their subordinates and then claiming ignorance 
when fraud is uncovered in the financial statements.  
 
There are two types of officer certifications mandated by Sarbanes-Oxley: criminal 
certifications, which are set forth in section 906 of the Act and codified at 18, U.S.C., § 1350, 
and civil certifications, which are set forth in section 302. 
 
Financial Transactions  Securities Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1505 
CRIMINAL CERTIFICATIONS (§ 906) 
Periodic filings with the SEC must now be accompanied by a statement, signed by the CEO 
and CFO, which certifies that the report fully complies with the SEC’s periodic reporting 
requirements and that the information in the report fairly presents, in all material respects, 
the financial condition and results of operation of the company. 
These certifications are known as “criminal certifications” because the Act imposes criminal 
penalties on officers who violate the certification requirements.  
• Corporate officers who knowingly  violate the certification requirements are subject to 
fines of up to $1,000,000 and up to 10 years imprisonment, or both.  
• Corporate officers who willfully violate the certification requirements are subject to fines 
of up to $5,000,000 and up to 20 years imprisonment, or both.  
 
CIVIL CERTIFICATIONS (§ 302) 
Section 302 of the Act requires the CEO and CFO to personally certify the following in 
their reports:  
• They have personally reviewed the report;  
• Based on their knowledge, the report does not contain any material misstatement that 
would render the financials misleading;  
• Based on their knowledge the financial information in the report fairly presents in all 
material respects the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow of the 
company;  
• They are responsible for designing, maintaining, and evaluating the company’s internal 
controls, they have evaluated the controls within 90 days prior to the report, and they 
have presented their conclusions about the effectiveness of those controls in the report; 
• They have disclosed to the auditors and the audit committee any material weaknesses in 
the controls and any fraud, whether material or not, that involves management or other 
employees who have a significant role in the company’s internal controls; and 
• They have indicated in their report whether there have been significant changes in the 
company’s internal controls since the filing of the last report. 
 
Note that in items 2 and 3 the CEO and CFO are not required to certify that the financials 
are accurate or that there is no misstatement. They are simply required to certify that to their 
knowledge  the financials are accurate and not misleading. However, this does not mean that 
senior financial officers can simply plead ignorance about their companies’ SEC filings in 
order to avoid liability. The term “fairly presents” in item 3 is a broader standard than what 
is required by GAAP. In certifying that their SEC filings meet this standard, the CEO and 
Securities Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1506                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
CFO essentially must certify that the comp any (1) has selected appropriate accounting 
policies to ensure the material accuracy of the reports; (2) has properly applied those 
accounting standards; and (3) has disclosed financial information that reflects the underlying 
transactions and events of the company. Furthermore, the other certification rules (see 1, 
and 4–6 above) mandate that CEOs and CFOs take an active role in their companies’ public 
reporting, and in the design and maintenance of internal controls. 
 
It is significant that in item 4, the CEO and CFO not only have to certify that they are 
responsible for their companies’ internal controls, but also that they have evaluated the 
controls within 90 days prior to their quarterly or annual report.  Essentially, this certification 
requirement mandates that companies actively and continually re-evaluate their control 
structures to prevent fraud. 
 
In conjunction with the § 302 certification requirements on the responsibility of the CEO 
and CFO for internal controls, § 404 of the Act requires all annual reports to contain an 
internal control report that (1) states management’s responsibility for establishing and 
maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting; 
and (2) contains an assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and 
procedures of the company for financial reporting.  
 
Item 5 requires the CEO and CFO to certify that they have disclosed to their auditors and 
their audit committee any material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls, and also 
any fraud, whether material or not,  that involves management or other key employees. 
Obviously, this is a very broad reporting standard that goes beyond the “material” standard 
generally used in financial statement audits. The CEO and CFO now must report to their 
auditors and audit committee any fraud  committed by a manager. This places a greater burden 
on the CEO and CFO to take part in anti-fraud efforts and to be aware of fraudulent activity 
within their companies in order to meet this certification requirement.  
 
Item 6 is significant because periodic SEC filings must now include statements detailing 
significant changes to the internal controls of publicly traded companies. 
 
Standards for Audit Committee Independence 
AUDIT COMMITTEE RESPONSIBILITIES  
Section 301 of the Act requires that the audit committee for each publicly traded company 
shall be directly responsible for appointing, compensating, and overseeing the work of the 
Financial Transactions  Securities Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1507 
company’s outside auditors. The Act also mandates that the auditors must report directly to 
the audit committee ? not management ? and makes it the responsibility of the audit 
committee to resolve disputes between management and the auditors. Section 301 also 
requires that the audit committee must have the authority and funding to hire independent 
counsel and any other advisors it deems necessary to carry out its duties.  
 
COMPOSITION OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandates that each member of a company’s audit committee must 
be a member of its board of directors, and must otherwise be “independent.” The term 
“independent” means that the audit committee member can only receive compensation from 
the company for his service on the board of directors, the audit committee, or another 
committee of the board of directors. They cannot be paid by the company for any other 
consulting or advisory work.  
 
FINANCIAL EXPERT  
Section 407 of the Act requires every public company to disclose in its periodic reports to 
the SEC whether or not the audit committee has at least one member who is a “financial 
expert,” and if not to explain the reasons why. The Act defines a “financial expert” as a 
person who, through education and experience as a public accountant or auditor, or a CFO, 
comptroller, chief financial officer or a similar position (1) has an understanding of generally 
accepted accounting principles and financial statements; (2) has experience in preparing or 
auditing financial statements of comparable companies and the application of such principles 
in accounting for estimates, accruals, and reserves; (3) has experience with internal controls; 
and (4) has an understanding of audit committee functions.  
 
ESTABLISHING A WHISTLEBLOWING STRUCTURE 
The Act makes it the responsibility of the audit committee to establish procedures (e.g., a 
hotline) for receiving and dealing with complaints and anonymous employee tips regarding 
irregularities in the company’s accounting met hods, internal controls, or auditing matters.  
 
Enhanced Financial Disclosure Requirements 
OFF-BALANCE SHEET  TRANSACTIONS 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act directed the SEC to issue  rules that require the disclosure of all 
material off-balance sheet transactions by publicly traded companies. The rules require 
disclosure of “all material off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations 
(including contingent obligations), and other relationships the company may have with 
Securities Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1508                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
unconsolidated entities or persons that may have a material current or future effect on the 
company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, liquidity, capital expenditures, 
capital resources, or significant components of revenues or expenses.” These disclosures are 
required in all annual and quarterly SEC reports. 
 
PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
Section 401 also directed the SEC to issue rules on pro forma financial statements. These 
rules require that pro forma financials must not contain any untrue statements or omissions 
that would make them misleading and require that the pro forma financials be reconciled to 
GAAP. These rules apply to all pro forma financial statements that are filed with the SEC or 
that are included in any public disclosure or press release.  
 
PROHIBITIONS ON PERSONAL LOANS TO EXECUTIVES 
Section 402 makes it illegal for public companies to make personal loans or otherwise extend 
credit, either directly or indirectly, to or for any director or executive officer. There is an 
exception that applies to consumer lenders if the loans are consumer loans of the type the 
company normally makes to the public, and on the same terms. 
 
RESTRICTIONS ON INSIDER TRADING 
Section 403 establishes disclosure requirements for stock transactions by directors and 
officers of public companies, or by persons who own more than 10 percent of a publicly 
traded company’s stock. Reports of changes in  beneficial ownership by these persons must 
now be filed with the SEC by the end of the second business day following the transaction. 
 
Under § 306, directors and officers are also prohibited from trading in the company’s 
securities during any pension fund blackout periods. This restriction only applies to 
securities that were acquired as a result of their employment or service to the company. A 
blackout period is defined as any period of more than three consecutive business days in 
which at least 50 percent of the participants in the company’s retirement plan are restricted 
from trading in the company’s securities. If directors or officers violate this provision, they 
can be forced to disgorge to the company all profits received from the sale of securities 
during the blackout period. 
 
 
Financial Transactions  Securities Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1509 
CODES OF ETHICS FOR SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS  
Pursuant to § 406 of the Act, the SEC must establish rules that require public companies to 
disclose whether they have adopted a code of ethics for their senior financial officers, and if 
not, to explain the reasons why. The rules require immediate public disclosure any  
time there is a change of the code of ethics or a waiver of the code of ethics for a senior 
financial officer.  
 
ENHANCED REVIEW OF PERIODIC FILINGS 
Section 408 of the Act now requires the SEC to make regular and systematic reviews of 
disclosures made by public companies in their periodic reports to the SEC. Reviews of a 
company’s disclosures, including its financial statements, must be made at least once every 
three years. Prior to this enactment, reviews were typically minimal and tended to coincide 
with registered offerings. 
 
REAL TIME DISCLOSURES  
Under § 409, public companies must publicly disclose information concerning material 
changes in their financial condition or operations. These disclosures must be “in plain 
English” and must be made “on a rapid and current basis.”  
 
Protections for Corporate Whistleblowers Under Sarbanes-Oxley 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act establishes broad protections for corporate whistleblowers. There 
are two sections of the Act that address whistleblower protections: Section 806 deals with 
civil protections and section 1107 establishes criminal liability for those who retaliate against 
whistleblowers.  
 
CIVIL LIABILITY WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION 
Section 806 of the Act, which is codified at Title 18, U.S.C., § 1514A, creates civil liability for 
companies that retaliate against whistleblowers. It should be noted that this provision does 
not provide universal whistleblower protection; it  only protects employees of publicly traded 
companies. Section 806 makes it unlawful to fire, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in 
any other manner discriminate against an employee for providing information or aiding in an 
investigation of securities fraud. In order to trigger § 806 protections, the employee must 
report the suspected misconduct to a federal regulatory or law enforcement agency, a 
member of Congress or a committee of Congress, or a supervisor. Employees are also 
protected against retaliation for filing, testifying in, participating in, or otherwise assisting in a 
Securities Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1510                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
proceeding filed or about to be filed relating to an alleged violation of securities laws or  
SEC rules. 
 
The whistleblower protections apply even if the company is ultimately found not to have 
committed securities fraud. As long as the employee reasonably believes he is reporting 
conduct that constitutes a violation of various federal securities laws, then he is protected. 
The protections cover retaliatory acts not only by the company, but also by any officer, 
employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of the company.  
 
If a public company is found to have violated § 806, the Act provides for an award of 
compensatory damages sufficient to “make the employee whole.” Penalties include 
reinstatement; back pay with interest; and compensation for special damages including 
litigation costs, expert witness fees, and attorneys’ fees.  
 
CRIMINAL SANCTION WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION  
Section 1107 of Sarbanes-Oxley ? codified at Title 18, U.S.C., § 1513 ? makes it a crime to 
knowingly, with the intent to retaliate, take any harmful action against a person for providing 
truthful information relating to the commission or possible commission of any Federal 
offense. This protection is only triggered when information is provided to a law enforcement 
officer, it does not apply to reports made to supervisors or to members of Congress, as is 
the case under § 806.  
 
Additionally, the Act codified three criminal offenses to Title 18 of the Code. First, it is a 
criminal offense to alter, destroy, mutilate, conceal, cover-up, or falsify any record or 
document “with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence” a federal investigation or 
bankruptcy proceeding, carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. (18, U.S.C., 
§ 1519). Secondly, all auditing accountants of securities issuers must “maintain all audit or 
review workpapers for a period of 5 years.” Where  there is a knowing and willful violation of 
this offense, a sentence of up to 10 years may be imposed. (18, U.S.C., § 1520). Finally, the 
Act made codified an additional securities fraud offence that can carry a maximum sentence 
of 25 years’ imprisonment. (18, U.S.C., § 1348). 
 
In general, the coverage of § 1107 is much  broader than the civil liability whistleblower 
protections of § 806. While the § 806 protections apply only to employees of publicly traded 
companies, § 1107’s criminal whistleblower protections cover all individuals (and 
organizations) regardless of where they work. Also, § 806 only applies to violations of 
Financial Transactions  Securities Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1511 
securities laws or SEC rules and regulations. Section 1107, on the other hand, protects 
individuals who provide truthful information about the commission or possible commission 
of any Federal offense.  
 
Violations of § 1107 can be punished by fines of up to $250,000 and up to 10 years in prison 
for individuals. Corporations that violate the Act can be fined up to $500,000.  
 
Other Criminal Penalties  
SECURITIES FRAUD  
Section 807 of the Act makes securities fraud a crime under 18, U.S.C., § 1348, providing for 
fines up to $250,000 and up to 25 years in prison.  
 
SECURITIES FRAUD (TITLE 18, U.S. CODE, § 1348) 
Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts  to execute, a scheme or artifice — 
 
(1) to defraud any person in connection with any security of an issuer with a class of 
securities registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15, U.S.C., 
78l) or that is required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (15, U.S.C., 78o(d)); or 
 
(2) to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent  pretenses, representat ions, or promises, any 
money or property in connection with the purchase or sale of any security of an issuer with a 
class of securities registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15, 
U.S.C., 78l) or that is required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15, U.S.C., 78o(d)); 
 
shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned not more than 25 years, or both. 
 
DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION  
Section 802 of the Act makes destroying evidence to obstruct an investigation or any other 
matter within the jurisdiction of any U.S. department illegal and punishable by a fine of up to 
$250,000 and up to 20 years in prison.  
 
The final rules adopted by the SEC under section 802 specifically require that accountants 
who perform audits on publicly traded companies must maintain all audit or review work 
papers for a period of seven years. Although the original provisions of section 802 only 
Securities Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1512                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
required a retention period of five years, the SEC extended the requirement to be consistent 
with the seven-year retention period required under the Auditing Standards promulgated by 
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) per section 103 of the Act. 
Violations of the final SEC rules may be punished by fines up to $250,000 and up to 10 
years in jail for individuals, or fines up to $500,000 for corporations.  
 
Section 1102 of the Act amends § 1512 of the U.S. Code to make it a criminal offense to 
corruptly alter, destroy, mutilate or conceal a record or document with the intent to impair 
its integrity or use in an official proceeding, or to otherwise obstruct, influence, or impede 
any official proceeding or attempt to do so. Violations of this section are punishable by fines 
up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to 20 years.  
 
FREEZING OF ASSETS 
During an investigation of possible securities violations by a publicly traded company or any 
of its officers, directors, partners, agents, controlling persons, or employees, the SEC can 
petition a federal court to issue a 45-day freeze on “extraordinary payments” to any of the 
foregoing persons. If granted, the payments will be placed in an interest-bearing escrow 
account while the investigation commences. This provision was enacted to prevent 
corporate assets from being improperly distributed while an investigation is underway.  
 
BANKRUPTCY LOOPHOLES 
Section 803 amends the bankruptcy code so that judgments, settlements, damages, fines, 
penalties, restitution payments, disgorgement payments, etc., resulting from violations of 
Federal securities laws are non-dischargeable. This was intended to prevent corporate 
wrongdoers from sheltering their assets under bankruptcy protection.  
 
DISGORGEMENT OF BONUSES 
One of the most unique aspects of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is § 304, which states that if a 
publicly traded company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the 
company’s material noncompliance, as a result of “misconduct,” with any financial reporting 
requirement under securities laws, then the CEO and CFO must reimburse the company for: 
• Any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation received during the 
12 months after the initial filing of the report that requires restating; and  
• Any profits realized from the sale of the company’s securities during the same 12- 
month period. 
 
Financial Transactions  Securities Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1513 
While the Act requires the CEO and CFO to disgorge their bonuses if the company’s 
financial statements have to be restated because of “misconduct,” it makes no mention of 
whose misconduct triggers this provision. There is certainly nothing in the text of § 304 that 
limits the disgorgement provision to instances of misconduct by the CEO and CFO. 
Presumably, then, the CEO and CFO could be required to disgorge their bonuses and 
profits from the sale of company stock even if they had no knowledge of and took no part in 
the misconduct that made the restatement necessary.
