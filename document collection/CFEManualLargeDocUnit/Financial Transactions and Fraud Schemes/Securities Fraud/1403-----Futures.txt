Futures 
A future is a contract agreeing to buy or sell a specified quantity of something (such as foreign 
currency or commodities) at some future time at a price agreed upon now. In futures 
contracts, the delivery or sale of the product is assumed, and the investor has an obligation 
to fulfill the contract. Note that in reality, few futures contracts actually result in delivery. 
Usually, the investor will enter into offsetting futures contracts prior to the delivery date. As 
futures contracts are freely transferable, the two transactions can offset each other.
