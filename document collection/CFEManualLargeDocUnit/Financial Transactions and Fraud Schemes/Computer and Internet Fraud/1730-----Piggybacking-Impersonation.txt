Piggybacking/Impersonation 
Piggybacking and impersonation are frequently used to gain access to restricted areas. 
Examples include following someone in through a door with a badge reader, electronically 
using another’s user identification and password to gain computer access, and tapping into 
the terminal link of a user to cause the computer to believe that both terminals are the same 
person.
