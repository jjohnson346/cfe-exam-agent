File Slack Area 
There is a difference in most operating systems between the “logical” size of a file and the 
“physical” size of the file. The logical size pertains to the size in the number of “bytes” that 
the file occupies. In a directory listing, this is the number that is displayed for “file size.”   
 
The physical size of a file depends on how the operating system stores files. In most 
operating systems, the disk is organized into designated blocks called clusters. Files occupy a 
whole number of clusters, even if the logical size of the file is smaller than the cluster size. In 
these cases, difference in space between the physical file space and the logical file space is 
called the file slack area. This area might contain data from previously-erased files that could 
contain evidence. Unless the fraud examiner has a special utility to identify and investigate 
the file slack area, potential evidence possibly located there could be missed.
