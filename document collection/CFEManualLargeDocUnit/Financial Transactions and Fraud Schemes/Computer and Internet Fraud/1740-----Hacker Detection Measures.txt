Hacker Detection Measures 
An adequate hacker detection program contains three primary components: 
• Almost all communication systems maintain a log file that records all successful and 
unsuccessful system access attempts. These also allow for the printing of reports 
containing sign-on and sign-off activity. These reports should be printed out regularly and 
reviewed by the data security officer. Where possible, special reports should be printed 
on the number of unsuccessful access attempts. These attempts at logging into the 
system should be followed up by data security to determine their cause.  
• The data security function should have sufficient resources and staff to administer 
passwords, maintain the security software, review system activity reports, and follow up 
on all potential security violations.

• Finally, periodic reviews of telecommunications security should be performed by 
consultants and/or internal or external auditors, if the latter have the necessary 
experience and qualifications.
