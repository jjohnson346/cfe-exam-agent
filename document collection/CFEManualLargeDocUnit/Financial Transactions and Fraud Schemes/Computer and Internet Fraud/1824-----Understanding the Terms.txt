Understanding the Terms 
To effectively analyze the data stored within a computer the fraud examiner must have a 
practical understanding of the basic operations of a computer and how it stores information. 
The fraud examiner must also have the expertise to access the data at the most basic level. 
Without this knowledge, information could be hidden from view or stored within other files 
or locations not usually accessed by the computer. 
 
Each new development in technology brings with it new concepts and a new vocabulary. 
The modern fraud examiner must stay current on the terms used to describe technological 
developments, tools, and practices, as he may be asked to explain such concepts as part of 
the engagement, in the resulting report, or as an expert witness during consequent 
legal proceedings.  
 
Fraud examiners must also be educated in the use of the various software utilities that will 
enable them to analyze the electronic data. Utilities such as Norton Utilities will be of great 
assistance in investigations involving personal computers. There are several utility 
applications that automate a great deal of the evidence analysis process. However, you 
should not use these programs unless you have been properly trained.
