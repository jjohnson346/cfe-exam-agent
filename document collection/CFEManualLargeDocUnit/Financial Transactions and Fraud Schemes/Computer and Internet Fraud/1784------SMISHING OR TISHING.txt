SMISHING OR TISHING 
SMiShing is a hybrid of phishing and short message service, commonly known as text 
messaging. It uses much the same approach of phishing but delivers an alarming message 
via SMS (the protocol used to transmit text messages via cellular devices) instead of e-mail. 
Criminal activity such as SMiShing can be seen as the prelude to online frauds targeting 
mobile device users. As these devices continue to evolve, cyber criminals will take 
advantage of functionalities to obtain information as well as delivering mobile malware to 
mobile devices.
