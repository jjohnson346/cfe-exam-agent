Get Rich Quick  
Entering the phrase get rich quick in an Internet search engine results in sites with names like 
$50,000 First 10 Months, Secrets of the Millionaires, and Best Business Resource Center. These types 
of sites hawk everything from home businesses to investment opportunities. Some push 
home- and Internet-based businesses; others’ selling point is that telemarketers close all sales. 
The common denominator in these types of schemes is that consumers who spend money 
on them find themselves with worthless materials and information. 
 
The medium through which victims are snared lends the scam a false appearance of 
credibility. Glossy websites give the operations an official air. But, as with all get-rich-quick 
schemes, victims are sucked in through their desire to make easy money.
