SPEAR PHISHING 
Spear phishing is a targeted attack generally focused on a corporate entity. The ruse is meant 
to fool the corporate employee into believing that the phishing e-mail originated not from a 
bank or financial institution but from their own IT or HR department. The goal is to obtain 
the employee’s user name and password to access the corporate network.
