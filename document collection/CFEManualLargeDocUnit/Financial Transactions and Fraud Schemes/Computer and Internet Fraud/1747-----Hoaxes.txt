Hoaxes 
A massive amount of media attention in recent years has focused on computer viruses. Many 
of the virus scares that occur, however, are hoaxes. While that is, on one hand, fortunate, 
these phony warnings cause harm of their own. They slow down transmission of 
information and have been known to cause overloads of organizational e-mail networks. 
Most of these fraudulent warnings urge recipients to “forward this to everyone you know.” 
Before forwarding a questionable warning, it is wise to consult a few of the authorities who 
track viruses. The following sites can be accessed to confirm or debunk virus notifications: 
• www.symantec.com/avcenter/hoax.html 
• www.vmyths.com 
• www.fsecure.com/virus-info/hoax/ 
• www.snopes.com
