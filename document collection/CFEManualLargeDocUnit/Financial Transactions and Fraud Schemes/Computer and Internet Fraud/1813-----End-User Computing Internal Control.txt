End-User Computing Internal Control 
End-user computing, or distributed processing, has emerged since the advent of micro-computers 
and provides end-users with equipment (such as PCs) and processing capability. 
Examples include microcomputer development tools such as spreadsheets, database 
programs, and downloading part of an application and its associated files for processing on a 
local area network either connected to the mainframe or in a stand-alone mode. 
 
Several control concerns have been identified as a result of end-user computing. 
• Data center controls over the equipment itself (backups, access controls, local password 
administration, etc.) might not be implemented by the end users. 
• Locally developed spreadsheet or database applications might not have all the controls 
typically found in mainframe systems. 
• Access can be compromised by the end users by installing a modem and phone line 
connected to a local area network or stand-alone PC and not informing data security 
about the arrangement.
