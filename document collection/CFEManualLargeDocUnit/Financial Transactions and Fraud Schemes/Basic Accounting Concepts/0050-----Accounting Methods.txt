Accounting Methods 

There are two primary methods of accounting: cash-basis and accrual-basis. Cash-basis 
accounting involves recording revenues and expenses based on when a company pays or 
receives cash. For example, sales are recorded when a company receives payment for goods, 
regardless of when the goods are delivered. If a customer purchases goods on credit, the 
company does not book the sale until the cash is received for the sale. Likewise, if a 
customer prepays for a sale, the company records the sales revenue immediately, rather than 
when the goods are passed off to the customer. The same holds true with expenses: they are 
recorded when paid without consideration to when they are incurred.  
 
Accrual-basis accounting, on the other hand, requires revenues to be recorded when they are 
earned (generally, when goods are delivered or services are rendered to a customer), without

regard to when cash exchanges hands. Expenses are recorded in the same period as the 
revenues to which they relate. For example, employee wages are expensed in the period 
during which the employees provided services, which may not necessarily be the same 
period in which they were paid. 
 
Under cash accounting, a company may decide to postpone paying some expenses so they 
are not recorded in the current period, resulting in an artificially inflated bottom line. 
Conversely, accrual accounting requires expenses to be matched to revenues; therefore, it 
provides a truer picture of a company’s financial situation. As such, generally accepted 
accounting principles mandate the use of accrual-basis accounting.
