Financial Statements 
The results of the accounting process are reports, or financial statements, that exemplify the 
financial position and operating results of an entity. Financial statements are often the 
vehicles through which fraud occurs. 
 
According to AU section 623, Special Reports, promulgated by the AICPA’s Auditing 
Standards Board, financial statements include presentations of financial data and 
accompanying notes prepared in conformity with either generally accepted accounting 
principles or some other comprehensive basis of accounting. The following is a list of such 
financial statements: 
• Balance sheet 
• Statement of income or statement of operations 
• Statement of retained earnings 
• Statement of cash flows 
• Statement of changes in owners’ equity 
• Statement of assets and liabilities that does not include owners’ equity accounts 
• Statement of revenue and expenses 
• Summary of operations 
• Statement of operations by product lines 
• Statement of cash receipts and disbursements 
 
Although not specifically noted in AU section 623, financial statements may also include 
other financial data presentations, such as: 
• Prospective financial information (forecasts) 
Accounting Concepts  Financial Transactions   
1.106                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• Proxy statements 
• Interim financial information (for example, quarterly financial statements) 
• Current value financial presentations 
• Personal financial statements (current or present value) 
• Bankruptcy financial statements 
• Registration statement disclosures (Securities Act of 1933) 
 
Other comprehensive bases of accounting, according to AU section 623, include: 
• Government or regulatory agency accounting 
• Tax-basis accounting 
• Cash receipts and disbursements, or modified cash receipts and disbursements 
• Any other basis with a definite set of criteria applied to all material items, such as the 
price-level basis of accounting 
 
Consequently, the term financial statements  includes almost any financial data presentation 
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or another 
comprehensive basis of accounting. Throughout this section, the term financial statements 
will include the above forms of reporting financial data, including the accompanying 
footnotes and management’s discussion. For most companies, however, a full set of financial 
statements comprises a balance sheet, a statement of income, a statement of owners’ equity 
or a statement of retained earnings, and a statement of cash flows. Therefore, fraud 
examiners should be familiar with the purpose and components of each of these financial 
statements.  
 
Balance Sheet 
The balance sheet shows a “snapshot” of a company’s financial situation at a specific point in 
time, generally the last day of the accounting period. The balance sheet is an expansion of 
the accounting equation, assets = liabilities + owners’ equity. That is, it lists a company’s assets 
on one side and its liabilities and owners’ equity on the other side. The nature of the 
accounting equation means that the two sides of the statement should balance, hence the 
name “balance sheet.”  
 
The following balance sheet, derived from the journal entries in the above example, shows 
the financial position of XYZ Company on the last day of its first year of operations.

As mentioned, assets are the resources owned by a company. Generally, assets are presented 
on the balance sheet in order of liquidity, or how soon they are expected to be converted to 
cash. The first section on the assets side, current assets, includes all those assets that are 
expected to be converted to cash, sold, or used up within one year. This category usually 
includes cash, accounts receivable (the amount owed to a company by customers for sales 
on credit), inventory, and prepaid items. Following the current assets are the long-term assets, 
or those assets that will likely not be converted to cash in the near future, such as fixed assets 
(e.g., land, buildings, equipment) and intangible assets (e.g., patents, trademarks, goodwill). A 
company’s fixed assets are presented net of accumulated depreciation, an amount that 
represents the cumulative expense taken for wear-and-tear on a company’s property. 
Likewise, intangible assets are presented net of accumulated amortization, an amount that 
represents the collective expense taken for declines in value of the intangible property. 
 
Liabilities are presented in order of maturity. Like current assets, current liabilities  are those 
obligations that are expected to be paid within one year, such as accounts payable (the 
amount owed to vendors by a company for purchases on credit), accrued expenses (e.g., 
taxes payable or salaries payable), and the portion of long-term debts that will come due 
Accounting Concepts  Financial Transactions   
1.108                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
within the next year. Those liabilities that are not due for more than a year are listed under 
the heading long-term liabilities. The most common liabilities in this group are bonds, notes, 
and mortgages payable. The total balance of the note payable is listed under long-term 
liabilities on XYZ Company’s balance sheet, indicating that it does not have to make any 
payments on the note during the next year. However, if a $5,000 payment was required 
during the next year, the company would have to reclassify $5,000 of the note balance to the 
current liabilities section and show the remaining $70,000 as a long-term liability. This 
adjustment would not change the total amount of the outstanding liability that was shown — all 
$75,000 would still appear on the balance sheet - but it would allow financial statement 
users to know that the company had an obligation to pay $5,000 during the next year rather 
than at some unspecified time in the future.  
 
The owners’ equity in a firm generally represents amounts from two sources — owner 
contributions (usually referred to as common or capital stock, and paid-in capital) and 
undistributed earnings (usually referred to as retained earnings). The balance in the capital stock 
account increases when the owners of a company invest in it through the purchase of 
company stock. The retained earnings balance increases when a company has earnings and 
decreases when a company has losses. The retained earnings account is also decreased when 
earnings are distributed to a company’s owners in the form of dividends, or when a company 
has losses. XYZ Company’s balance sheet shows that the company’s owners have 
contributed $192,000 to the company and that the company has retained $8,000 of earnings 
as of December 31, 20XX.  
 
Income Statement 
Whereas the balance sheet shows a company’s financial position at a specific point in time, 
the income statement details how much profit (or loss) a company earned during a period of 
time, such as a quarter or a year. The accounts reflected on the income statement are 
temporary; at the end of each fiscal year, they are reduced to a zero balance (closed), with the 
resulting net income (or loss) added to (or subtracted from) retained earnings on the balance 
sheet.  
 
Below is the income statement for XYZ Company for its first year of operations based on 
the sample transactions above. 
 
Financial Transactions  Accounting Concepts 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.109 
XYZ Company 
Statement of Income 
For the Year Ended December 31, 20 X X  
   
Revenue   
Net Sales  $             40,000  
Less: Cost of Goods Sold  25,000  
Gross Profit   $             15,000 
   
Operating Expenses    
Depreciation 7,000  
Total Operating Expenses  7,000 
   
Net Income   $               8,000 
 
Two basic types of accounts are reported on the income statement - revenues  and expenses. 
Revenues represent amounts received from the sale of goods or services during the 
accounting period. Most companies present net sales  or net service revenues  as the first line item 
on the income statement. The term “net” means that the amount shown is the company’s 
total sales minus any sales refunds, returns, discounts, or allowances.  
 
From net sales, an expense titled cost of goods sold  or cost of sales  is deducted. Regardless of 
industry, this expense denotes the amount a company spent (in past, present, and/or future 
accounting periods) to produce the goods or services that were sold during the current 
period. For a company that manufactures goods, cost of goods sold signifies the amount the 
company spent on materials, labor, and overhead expenses to produce the goods that were 
sold during the accounting period. For a merchandise reseller, this expense is the amount the 
company has paid to purchase the goods that were resold during the period. For a service 
company, the cost of sales is typically the amount of salaries paid to the employees who 
performed the services that were sold. The difference between net sales and cost of goods 
sold is called gross profit  or gross margin, which represents the amount left over from sales to 
pay the company’s operating expenses.  
 
Operating expenses are those costs that a company incurs to support and sustain its business 
operations. Generally, these expenses include items such as advertising, management’s 
salaries, office supplies, repairs and maintenance, rent, utilities, depreciation, interest, and 
Accounting Concepts  Financial Transactions   
1.110                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
taxes. Accrual accounting requires that these items be included on the income statement in 
the period in which they are incurred, regardless of when they are paid.  
 
After subtracting operating expenses from gross profit, a company’s net income or net earnings 
for the period is determined. If a company’s total expenses were greater than its total 
revenues and the bottom line is negative, then it had a net loss  for the period. Commonly, a 
profitable company will distribute some of its net income to its owners in the form of 
dividends. Whatever income is not distributed is transferred to the retained earnings account 
on the balance sheet. In the case of XYZ Company, net income for the year was $8,000. The 
company did not distribute any of these earnings, so the total amount — $8,000 — is shown 
on the balance sheet as retained earnings. If the company is also profitable during its next 
year of operations, any net income that is not distributed as dividends will be added to the 
$8,000 balance in retained earnings. If expenses outpace revenues and XYZ Company shows 
a loss for its second year, that loss will be deducted from the $8,000 retained earnings 
balance at the end of the second year.  
 
To summarize, the income statement ties to the balance sheet through the retained earnings 
account as follows: 
 
 
 
Statement of Owners’ Equity 
The statement of owners’ equity details the changes in the total owners’ equity amount listed 
on the balance sheet. Because it shows how the amounts on the income statement flow 
through to the balance sheet, it acts as the connecting link between the two statements. The 
balance of the owners’ equity at the beginning of the year is the starting point for the 
statement. The transactions that affect owners’ equity are listed next and added together. 
The result is added to (or subtracted from, if negative) the beginning-of-the-year balance, 
which provides the end-of-the-year balance for total owners’ equity.  
Assets Liabilities + Owners’ Equity =  
Common Stock Retained Earnings
 Dividends Net  Income
 Revenue Expenses 
Financial Transactions  Accounting Concepts 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.111 
The statement of owners’ equity for XYZ Company would appear as follows:  
 
XYZ Company 
Statement of Owners’ Equity 
For the Year Ended December 31, 20XX  
  
Owners’ equity, January 1, 20XX  $              -  
Investment by owners during the year  $      192,000  
Net income for the year 8,000  
Increase in owners’ equity 200,000  
Owners’ equity, December 31, 20XX  $      200,000  
 
XYZ Company completed two types of transactions that affected the owners’ equity during 
20XX: the $192,000 invested by the company’s shareholders, and the revenue and expenses 
that resulted in the net income of $8,000. Had the company distributed any money to the 
shareholders in the form of dividends, that amount would be listed on the statement of 
owners’ equity as well. Notice that the $8,000 ties directly to the bottom line of the income 
statement, and the $200,000 owners’ equity ties to the “total owners’ equity” amount on the 
balance sheet.  
 
Some companies present a statement of retained earnings rather than a statement of owners’ 
equity. Similar to the statement of owners’ equity,  the statement of retained earnings starts 
with the retained earnings balance at the beginning of the year. All transactions affecting the 
retained earnings account are then listed and added to the beginning balance to arrive at the 
ending balance in the retained earnings account. Below is an example of the statement of 
retained earnings for XYZ Company:  
 
XYZ Company 
Statement of Retained Earnings 
For the Year Ended December 31, 20XX  
   
Retained earnings, January 1, 20XX  $              -   
Net income for the year  $         8,000  
Increase in owners’ equity 8,000  
Retained earnings, December 31, 20XX  $         8,000

Statement of Cash Flows 
The statement of cash flows reports a company’s sources and uses of cash during the 
accounting period. This statement is often used by potential investors and other interested 
parties in tandem with the income statement to determine the true financial performance of 
a company during the period being reported. The nature of accrual accounting allows (and 
often requires) the income statement to contain many non-cash items and subjective 
estimates that make it difficult to fully and clearly interpret a company’s operating results. 
However, it is much harder to distort the amount of cold, hard cash that was received and 
paid during the year, so the statement of cash flows adds to the transparency of the financial 
statements.  
 
The following is the statement of cash flows for XYZ Company:  
 
XYZ Company 
Statement of Cash Flows — Direct Method 
For the Year Ended December 31, 20 X X  
   
Cash flows from operating activities   
Cash received from customers  $       15,000  
Cash paid for merchandise (14,000)  
Net cash flows from operating activities  $         1,000  
  
Cash flows from investing activities  
Cash paid for purchase of equipment (70,000)  
Net cash flows from investing activities (70,000) 
  
Cash flows from financing activities  
Cash received as owners’ investment 192,000  
Cash received from issuing note payable 80,000  
Cash paid on note payable (5,000)  
Net cash flows from financing activities 267,000  
  
Increase in cash 198,000  
Cash balance at the beginning of the year           0  
Cash balance at the end of the year  $      198,000  
 
The statement of cash flows is broken down into three sections: cash flows from operating 
activities, cash flows from investing activities, and cash flows from financing activities.  
Financial Transactions  Accounting Concepts 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.113 
Cash Flows from Operations 
The cash flows from operations section summarizes a company’s cash receipts and payments 
arising from its normal business operations. Cash inflows included in this category 
commonly consist of payments received from customers for sales, and cash outflows include 
payments to vendors for merchandise and operating expenses and to employees for wages.  
 
This category can also be summarized as those cash transactions that ultimately affect a 
company’s operating income; therefore, it is often considered the most important of the 
three categories of cash flows. If a company continually shows large profits per its income 
statement, but cannot generate positive cash flows from operations, then questionable 
accounting practices might be to blame. On the other hand, net income that is supported by 
positive and increasing net cash flows from operations is generally considered an indicator of 
a strong company. 
 
There are two methods of reporting cash flows from operations. In the above example, 
XYZ Company’s statement of cash flows is presented using the direct method. This method 
lists the sources of operating cash flows and the uses of operating cash flows, with the 
difference between them being the net cash flow from operating activities.  
 
In contrast, the indirect method  reconciles net income per the income statement with net cash 
flows from operating activities; that is, accrual-basis net income is adjusted for non-cash 
revenues and expenses to arrive at net cash flows from operations. Below is an example of 
XYZ Company’s cash flows from operations using the indirect method:  
 
XYZ Company 
Statement of Cash Flows — Indirect Method 
For the Year Ended December 31, 20 X X  
Cash flows from operating activities   
Net income, per income statement   $         8,000  
Add:  Depreciation  $         7,000  
  Increase in accounts payable 11,000 18,000  
  26,000  
Subtract:  Increase in accounts receivable (25,000) (25,000) 
Net cash flows from operating activities  1,000  
 
Accounting Concepts  Financial Transactions   
1.114                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Note that the net cash flows from operating activities is the same amount - in this case, 
$1,000 — regardless of the method that is used.  The indirect method is usually easier to 
compute and provides a comparison of a company’s operating results under the accrual and 
cash methods of accounting. As a result, most companies choose to use the indirect method, 
but either method is acceptable.  
 
Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
Cash inflows from investing activities usually arise from the sale of fixed assets (e.g., 
property and equipment), investments (e.g., the stocks and bonds of other companies), or 
intangible assets (e.g., patents and trademarks). Similarly, cash outflows from investing 
activities include any cash paid for the purchase of fixed assets, investments, or intangible 
assets.  
 
Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
Cash flows from financing activities involve the cash received or paid in connection with 
issuing debt and equity securities. Cash inflows in this category occur when a company sells 
its own stock, issues bonds, or takes out a loan. A company’s cash outflows from financing 
activities include paying cash dividends to shareholders, acquiring shares of its own stock 
(called treasury stock), and repaying debt.  
  
The total cash flows from all three categories are combined to arrive at the net increase or 
decrease in cash for the year. This total is then added to or subtracted from the cash balance 
at the beginning of the year to arrive at the cash balance at the end of the year, which ties 
back to the amount of cash reported on the balance sheet.  
 
Users of Financial Statements 
Financial statement fraud schemes are most often perpetrated by management against 
potential users of the statements. These users of financial statements include company 
ownership and management, lending organizations, investors, regulating bodies, vendors, 
and customers. The production of truthful financial statements plays an important role in 
the continued success of an organization. However, fraudulent statements can be used for a 
number of reasons. The most common use is to increase the apparent prosperity of an 
organization in the eyes of potential and current investors. (For more information, see the 
chapter on “Financial Statement Fraud.”)
