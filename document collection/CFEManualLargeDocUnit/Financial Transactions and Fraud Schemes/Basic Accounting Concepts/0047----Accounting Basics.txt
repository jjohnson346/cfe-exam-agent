Accounting Basics 
Accounting can be defined as the identification, accumulation, measurement, and 
communication of economic data about an enterprise for decision makers and other 
interested parties. The measurement and recording of this data are accomplished through 
keeping a balance of the accounting equation. The accounting model or accounting equation, 
as shown below, is the basis for all double-entry accounting:  
 
Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity 
 
By definition, assets consist of the net resources owned by an entity. Examples of assets 
include cash, receivables, inventory, property, and equipment, as well as intangible items of 
value such as patents, licenses, and trademarks. To qualify as an asset, an item must (1) be 
owned by the entity and (2) provide future benefit.  
 
Liabilities are the obligations of an entity or outsiders’ claims against a company’s assets. 
Liabilities usually arise from the acquisition of assets or the incurrence of operational 
expenses.

Owners’ equity  represents the investment of a company’s owners plus accumulated profits 
(revenues less expenses). Owners’ equity is equal to assets minus liabilities.  
 
This equation has been the cornerstone of accounting since 1494, when Luca Pacioli 
invented it. The balance of the equation is the key. If a company borrows from a bank, cash 
(an asset) and notes payable (a liability) increase to show the receipt of cash and an 
obligation owed by the company. Since both assets and liabilities increase by the same 
amount, the equation stays in balance.  
 
Accounts and the Accounting Cycle 
The major components of the accounting equation are made up of numerous detail 
accounts. An account is nothing more than a specific accounting record that provides an 
efficient way to categorize similar transactions. All transactions are recorded in accounts that 
are categorized as asset accounts, liability accounts, owners’ equity accounts, revenue 
accounts, and expense accounts. Account format occurs in a number of ways. The simplest, 
most fundamental format is the use of a large letter T, often referred to as a T account.  
 
Entries to the left side of an account are debits (dr) and entries to the right side of an account 
are credits (cr). Debits increase asset and expense accounts, while credits decrease them. 
Conversely, credits increase liability, owners’ equity, and revenue accounts; debits decrease 
them. Every transaction recorded in the accounting records will have both a debit and a 
credit, thus the term double-entry accounting. The accounting equation, in the form of T 
accounts, looks like the following:   
 
 
 
Fraud investigation often requires an understanding of the debit-and-credit process. For 
example, a fraud examiner who is searching for a mysterious $5,000 disappearance of cash 
finds a debit in the legal expense account and a corresponding credit in the cash account for 
$5,000, but cannot find genuine documentation for the charge. The examiner can then 
reasonably suspect that a perpetrator may have attempted to conceal the theft by labeling the 
misappropriated $5,000 as a legal expense.  
 
 Assets  =  Liabilities + Owner's Equities

Discovering concealment efforts through a review of accounting records is one of the easier 
methods of detecting internal fraud; usually, one needs only to look for weaknesses in the 
various steps of the accounting cycle. Legitimate transactions leave an audit trail. They start 
with a source document such as an invoice, a check, a receipt, or a receiving report. These 
source documents become the basis for journal entries, which are chronological listings of 
transactions with their debit and credit amounts. Entries are made in various accounting 
journals. Then, entries are posted to the appropriate general ledger accounts. The 
summarized account amounts become the basis for financial statements for a particular 
period. 
 
Illustrated below is this flow of transactional information through the accounting records, 
followed by examples of typical accounting transactions, to help in understanding how 
transactions affect the balance sheet: 
 
 
Journal Entries  
As transactions occur, they are recorded in a company’s books via journal entries. Each journal 
entry serves as a record of a particular transaction and forms an audit trail that can be 
retraced later for an understanding of a company’s operations. Journal entries that are not 
triggered by a transaction, called adjusting journal entries, are also made periodically for items 
such as depreciation expense and accounts receivable write-offs.

Accounting Methods 

There are two primary methods of accounting: cash-basis and accrual-basis. Cash-basis 
accounting involves recording revenues and expenses based on when a company pays or 
receives cash. For example, sales are recorded when a company receives payment for goods, 
regardless of when the goods are delivered. If a customer purchases goods on credit, the 
company does not book the sale until the cash is received for the sale. Likewise, if a 
customer prepays for a sale, the company records the sales revenue immediately, rather than 
when the goods are passed off to the customer. The same holds true with expenses: they are 
recorded when paid without consideration to when they are incurred.  
 
Accrual-basis accounting, on the other hand, requires revenues to be recorded when they are 
earned (generally, when goods are delivered or services are rendered to a customer), without

regard to when cash exchanges hands. Expenses are recorded in the same period as the 
revenues to which they relate. For example, employee wages are expensed in the period 
during which the employees provided services, which may not necessarily be the same 
period in which they were paid. 
 
Under cash accounting, a company may decide to postpone paying some expenses so they 
are not recorded in the current period, resulting in an artificially inflated bottom line. 
Conversely, accrual accounting requires expenses to be matched to revenues; therefore, it 
provides a truer picture of a company’s financial situation. As such, generally accepted 
accounting principles mandate the use of accrual-basis accounting.
