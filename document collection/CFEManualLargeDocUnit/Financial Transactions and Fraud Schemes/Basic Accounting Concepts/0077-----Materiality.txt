Materiality 
The amount of an item is material if its omission would affect the judgment of a reasonable 
person who is relying on the financial statements. The materiality threshold does not mean 
that immaterial items do not have to be recorded; rather, strict adherence to GAAP is 
necessary only when the item has a significant impact on the financial statements of an 
entity. In addition, the aggregate effect of immaterial items must also be considered.
