Income Statement 
Whereas the balance sheet shows a company’s financial position at a specific point in time, 
the income statement details how much profit (or loss) a company earned during a period of 
time, such as a quarter or a year. The accounts reflected on the income statement are 
temporary; at the end of each fiscal year, they are reduced to a zero balance (closed), with the 
resulting net income (or loss) added to (or subtracted from) retained earnings on the balance 
sheet.  
 
Below is the income statement for XYZ Company for its first year of operations based on 
the sample transactions above.

Two basic types of accounts are reported on the income statement - revenues  and expenses. 
Revenues represent amounts received from the sale of goods or services during the 
accounting period. Most companies present net sales  or net service revenues  as the first line item 
on the income statement. The term “net” means that the amount shown is the company’s 
total sales minus any sales refunds, returns, discounts, or allowances.  
 
From net sales, an expense titled cost of goods sold  or cost of sales  is deducted. Regardless of 
industry, this expense denotes the amount a company spent (in past, present, and/or future 
accounting periods) to produce the goods or services that were sold during the current 
period. For a company that manufactures goods, cost of goods sold signifies the amount the 
company spent on materials, labor, and overhead expenses to produce the goods that were 
sold during the accounting period. For a merchandise reseller, this expense is the amount the 
company has paid to purchase the goods that were resold during the period. For a service 
company, the cost of sales is typically the amount of salaries paid to the employees who 
performed the services that were sold. The difference between net sales and cost of goods 
sold is called gross profit  or gross margin, which represents the amount left over from sales to 
pay the company’s operating expenses.  
 
Operating expenses are those costs that a company incurs to support and sustain its business 
operations. Generally, these expenses include items such as advertising, management’s 
salaries, office supplies, repairs and maintenance, rent, utilities, depreciation, interest, and 
Accounting Concepts  Financial Transactions

taxes. Accrual accounting requires that these items be included on the income statement in 
the period in which they are incurred, regardless of when they are paid.  
 
After subtracting operating expenses from gross profit, a company’s net income or net earnings 
for the period is determined. If a company’s total expenses were greater than its total 
revenues and the bottom line is negative, then it had a net loss  for the period. Commonly, a 
profitable company will distribute some of its net income to its owners in the form of 
dividends. Whatever income is not distributed is transferred to the retained earnings account 
on the balance sheet. In the case of XYZ Company, net income for the year was $8,000. The 
company did not distribute any of these earnings, so the total amount — $8,000 — is shown 
on the balance sheet as retained earnings. If the company is also profitable during its next 
year of operations, any net income that is not distributed as dividends will be added to the 
$8,000 balance in retained earnings. If expenses outpace revenues and XYZ Company shows 
a loss for its second year, that loss will be deducted from the $8,000 retained earnings 
balance at the end of the second year.  
 
To summarize, the income statement ties to the balance sheet through the retained earnings 
account as follows:
