Collectibles and Memorabilia 
Collectibles and household decorative items such as vases, bric-a-brac, and figurines are also 
commonly hawked by telemarketers. Again, these supposedly valuable objects are nothing 
more than cheap, shoddy merchandise. War memorabilia is especially popular, particularly 
items related to the World War II. Documents and keepsakes from any bygone era are on 
the fraudulent telemarketer’s best-seller list. Stamps are sold as rare when they are in  
fact worthless.  
 
Coins are another prime money-maker for telemarketers. “Certificates of authenticity” and 
“appraisals” are included with the merchandise to reassure customers, but needless to  
say these documents are usually produced by the sales company, or doctored from a 
legitimate original.
