Check-Cashing Establishments 
Another convenient tool at the telemarketer’s disposal is the check-cashing store. If a boiler 
room operation wishes to avoid the risks of setting up a bank account that might be traced 
or seized, customers’ personal checks are taken to a company that cashes them for a small 
fee. These establishments rarely require any identification to cash the checks. Customers may 
complain and try to stop payment on their checks, but they are ordinarily too late.
