RICO 
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18, U.S.C., § 1961 et seq., 
is the most powerful anti-fraud statute available to civil litigants because it provides for 
automatic trebling (tripling) of damages plus attorneys’ fees and costs—and RICO is highly 
relevant to franchising. There have been several cases where class action plaintiffs have 
established RICO claims based on the ongoing, system-wide fraud that had occurred 
concerning the advertising funds.
