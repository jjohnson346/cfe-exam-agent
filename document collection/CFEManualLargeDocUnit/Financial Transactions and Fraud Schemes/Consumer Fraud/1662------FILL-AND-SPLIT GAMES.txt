FILL-AND-SPLIT GAMES 
The best way to launch a pure cash pyramid is to jazz it up with gaming elements, some kind 
of hook to keep players’ attention focused on their riches and not how stupid their latest 
“opportunity” really is. These are sometimes called “fill-and-split games.” A popular version 
of this approach has been known as “Airplane.” Each player buys a seat on a fictitious 
airplane, paying from $200 to $2,000 a seat, depending on the scale of the game. Initial 
players help recruit new “passengers” and move up through the ranks of “crew,” “copilot,” 
and “pilot.” When a flight is fully booked — with something like six passengers, four crew 
members, a copilot, and a pilot — the plane takes off, the pilots and crew are paid for the 
flight, and everybody moves up the ranks. Just like a real airline, a plane’s investors are 
constantly looking to fill their seats.  
 
Another variation of the fill-and-split game tries to capitalize on the phenomenal profits 
yielded over the last 15 years by the American stock market. Called “Financial Networking,” 
“Market Climb,” or another financial-sounding name, these pure cash pyramids use a business 
metaphor in their pitch. A typical operation spreads 15 people over four levels. Eight investors 
buy into the network as “vice-presidents”; above them are four “presidents,” just below two 
“cochairman” positions; at the top, sitting pretty, is the “chairman.” Every time the eight slots 
at the bottom are filled (average price $1,500 to $2,000), the pyramid splits. The chairman gets 
out of the game with a “golden parachute” and everyone moves up the corporate ladder, 
anxiously scanning for new recruits.  
 
These games are usually predicated on what’s become known as affinity fraud. New players 
are recruited by their affinity with existing participants. People comb religious groups or 
community associations for fresh leads. Affinities may be racial or cultural. Financial 
networking, for example, has targeted a number of African-American communities. 
Churches, synagogues, and other religious organizations offer fertile hunting grounds and 
great cover from promoters—an endorsement from a clergyperson is as good as gold, and 
law enforcement authorities are often reluctant to meddle in religious affairs. Affinity frauds 
may also prey on social groups or professional organizations.
