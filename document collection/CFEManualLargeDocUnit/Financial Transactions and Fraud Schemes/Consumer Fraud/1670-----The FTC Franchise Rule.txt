The FTC Franchise Rule 
The FTC Franchise Rule prohibits fraud in the initial sale of a franchise in which the 
franchise affects interstate commerce. Under the rule, franchisors must furnish potential 
franchisees with written disclosures providing important information about the franchisor, 
the franchised business and the franchise relationship, and give them at least 10 business 
days to review it before investing.

Franchisors may make the required disclosures by following either the Rule’s disclosure 
format or the Uniform Franchise Offering Circular (UFOC) Guidelines prepared by state 
franchise law officials. 
 
The Rule imposes six different requirements in connection with the “advertising, offering, 
licensing, contracting, sale, or other promotion” of a franchise in or affecting commerce:  
• The Rule requires franchisors to give potential investors a basic disclosure document at 
the earlier of the first face-to-face meeting or 10 business days before any money is paid 
or an agreement is signed in connection with the investment. 
• If a franchisor makes earnings claims, whether historical or forecasted, they must have a 
reasonable basis, and prescribed substantiating disclosures must be given to a potential 
investor in writing at the same time as the basic disclosures.  
• The Rule affects only ads that include an earnings claim. Such ads must disclose the 
number and percentage of existing franchisees who have achieved the claimed results, 
along with cautionary language. Their use triggers required compliance with the Rule’s 
earnings claim disclosure requirements.  
• The franchisor must give investors a copy of its standard-form franchise and related 
agreements at the same time as the basic disclosures, and final copies intended to be 
executed at least five business days before signing.  
• The Rule requires franchisors to make refunds of deposits and initial payments to 
potential investors, subject to any conditions on refundability stated in the disclosure 
document.  
 
While franchisors are free to provide investors with any promotional or other materials they 
wish, no written or oral claims may contradict information provided in the required 
disclosure document.  
 
The FTC alone has jurisdiction to enforce the rule. However, any misrepresentations in a 
UFOC certainly could be used to support claims for fraud under state statutory and/or 
common law. The FTC rule preempts inconsistent state laws. As a practical matter, it creates 
a minimum disclosure standard, which many states have equaled or enhanced by statute.
