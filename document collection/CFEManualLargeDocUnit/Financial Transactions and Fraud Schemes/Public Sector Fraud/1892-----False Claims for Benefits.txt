False Claims for Benefits 
 
EXAMPLE 
A New Jersey Council woman admitted to stealing more than $17,000 in Social Security 
disability benefits from 2007 to 2009. According to her attorney, she had been unable to 
work because of surgeries and pain in her back and had received disability benefits of $600 
per month for a total of for six years. However, she had been working at her family’s 
restaurant for a portion of the time that she was claiming disability. She was asked to help 
out there after her mother’s death in 2007 on a temporary basis, which over time became 
on a daily basis. She resigned from her post, repaid the money, and was sentenced to one 
year probation.
