Reporting Deficiencies in Internal Control, Fraud, Illegal Acts, Violations of Provisions of Contracts or Grant Agreements, and Abuse 
5.10  For financial audits, including audits of financial statements in which auditors 
provide an opinion or disclaimer, auditors should report, as applicable to the 
objectives of the audit, and based upon the audit work performed, (1) significant 
deficiencies in internal control, identifying those considered to be material 
weaknesses; (2) all instances of fraud and illegal acts unless inconsequential; and (3) 
violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements and abuse that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements. 
 
FRAUD, ILLEGAL ACTS, VIOLATIONS OF PROVISIONS OF CONTRACTS OR GRANT AGREEMENTS, AND ABUSE 
5.15  Under AICPA standards and GAGAS, auditors have responsibilities for detecting 
fraud and illegal acts that have a material effect on the financial statements and 
determining whether those charged with governance are adequately informed about 
fraud and illegal acts. GAGAS include additional reporting standards. When auditors 
conclude, based on sufficient, appropriate evidence, that any of the following either 
has occurred or is likely to have occurred, they should include in their audit report 
the relevant information about 
a. Fraud and illegal acts that have an effect on the financial statements that is more 
than inconsequential, 
Public Sector Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1906                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
b. Fraud and illegal acts that have an effect on the financial statements that is more 
than inconsequential, determination of financial statement amounts or other 
financial data significant to the audit, and 
c. Abuse that is material, either quantitatively or qualitatively. 
5.16  When auditors detect violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements or 
abuse that have an effect on the financial statements that is less than material but 
more than inconsequential, they should communicate those findings in writing to 
officials of the audited entity. Determining whether and how to communicate to 
officials of the audited entity fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts 
or grant agreements, or abuse that is inconsequential is a matter of professional 
judgment. Auditors should document such communications. 
5.17 When fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or 
abuse either have occurred or are likely to have occurred, auditors may consult with 
authorities or legal counsel about whether publicly reporting such information would 
compromise investigative or legal proceedings. Auditors may limit their public 
reporting to matters that would not compromise those proceedings, and for 
example, report only on information that is already a part of the public record. 
 
REPORTING FINDINGS DIRECTLY TO PARTIES OUTSIDE THE AUDITED ENTITY 
5.18  Auditors should report known or likely fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of 
contracts or grant agreements, or abuse directly to parties outside the audited entity 
in the following two circumstances: 
a. When entity management fails to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements to 
report such information to external parties specified in law or regulation, auditors 
should first communicate the failure to report such information to those charged 
with governance. If the audited entity still does not report this information to the 
specified external parties as soon as practicable after the auditors’ 
communication with those charged with governance, then the auditors should 
report the information directly to the specified external parties. 
b. When entity management fails to take timely and appropriate steps to respond to 
known or likely fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant 
agreements, or abuse that (1) is likely to have a material effect on the financial 
statements and (2) involves funding received directly or indirectly from a 
government agency, auditors should first report management’s failure to take 
timely and appropriate steps to those charged with governance. If the audited 
entity still does not take timely and appropriate steps as soon as practicable after 
Financial Transactions  Public Sector Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1907 
the auditors’ communication with those charged with governance, then the 
auditors should report the entity’s failure to take timely and appropriate steps 
directly to the funding agency. 
5.19  The reporting in paragraph 5.18 is in addition to any legal requirements to report 
such information directly to parties outside the audited entity. Auditors should 
comply with these requirements even if they have resigned or been dismissed from 
the audit prior to its completion. 
5.20  Auditors should obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence, such as confirmation from 
outside parties, to corroborate assertions by management of the audited entity that it 
has reported such findings in accordance with laws, regulations, and funding 
agreements. When auditors are unable to do so, they should report such information 
directly as discussed in paragraph 5.18. 
 
PRESENTING FINDINGS IN THE AUDITORS’ REPORT 
5.21  In presenting findings such as deficiencies in internal control, fraud, illegal acts, 
violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, and abuse, auditors should 
develop the elements of the findings to the extent necessary to achieve the audit 
objectives. Clearly developed audit findings, as discussed in paragraphs 4.14 through 
4.18, assist management or oversight officials of the audited entity in understanding 
the need for taking corrective action. If auditors sufficiently develop the elements of 
a finding, they may provide recommendations for corrective action. 
5.22 Auditors should place their findings in perspective by describing the nature and 
extent of the issues being reported and the extent of the work performed that 
resulted in the finding. To give the reader a basis for judging the prevalence and 
consequences of these findings, auditors should, as applicable, relate the instances 
identified to the population or the number of cases examined and quantify the results 
in terms of dollar value or other measures, as appropriate. If the results cannot be 
projected, auditors should limit their conclusions appropriately.
