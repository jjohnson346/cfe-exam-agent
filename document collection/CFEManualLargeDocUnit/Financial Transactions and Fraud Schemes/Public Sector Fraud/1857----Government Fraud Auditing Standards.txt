Government Fraud Auditing Standards 
Standards for audits of government organizations, programs, activities, and functions, and of 
government assistance received by contractors, non-profit organizations, and other non-
 government organizations have been developed by the Comptroller General of the United 
States, Government Accountability Office (GAO). These standards are by and large taken 
from generally accepted auditing standards as established by the AICPA. However, 
Government Auditing Standards, also known as the Yellow Book, go beyond the AICPA 
standards. Generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS) are required to be 
followed by auditors and audit organizations when mandated by law, regulation, agreement, 
contract, or policy. These standards include the following classifications: 
• General standards 
• Fieldwork standards for financial audits 
• Reporting standards for financial audits 
• Field work standards for performance audits 
• Reporting standards for performance audits 
 
(The Yellow Book also provides separate general, field work, and reporting standards for 
attestation engagements. However, the following discussion will focus on those standards 
applicable to financial and performance auditing engagements.) 
 
General standards apply to both financial and performance audits and relate to: 
• Independence of the audit organization and its individual auditors. 
• Use of professional judgment in the performance of work and the preparation of related 
reports. 
• Competence of the audit staff. 
• Audit quality control and assurance. 
• External peer reviews. 
 
Financial audits provide an independent assessment as to whether financial statements are 
presented fairly in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or other 
recognized criteria. Other objectives of financial audits, which provide for different levels of 
assurance and entail various scopes of work, may include: 
  
Public Sector Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1902                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• Reporting on internal control, compliance with laws and regulations, and provisions of 
contracts and grant agreements as they relate to financial transactions, systems, and 
processes; 
• Providing special reports for specified elements, accounts, or items of a financial 
statement; 
• Reviewing interim financial information; 
• Issuing letters for underwriters and certain other requesting parties; 
• Reporting on the controls over the processing of transactions by service organizations; 
and 
• Auditing compliance with regulations relating to federal award expenditures and other 
governmental financial assistance in conjunction with or as a by-product of a financial 
statement audit. 
 
Performance audits provide assurance or conclusions on certain audit objectives based on 
evaluation against objective criteria, such as specific requirements, measures, or defined 
business practices. Performance audits include engagements related to assessing program 
economy, efficiency, and effectiveness; inter nal controls; compliance; and prospective 
analyses.  
 
The following are the GAO Standards or portions thereof that relate to the government 
auditor’s responsibilities pertaining to fraud. (The standards included in the following section 
reflect the version of the standards adopted by the GAO in of July, 2007.) 
 
Field Work Standards for Financial Audits — Chapter 4 
GAGAS field work standards for financial audits include the three AICPA generally 
accepted standards of field work and five other standards specific to government financial 
audits covering auditor communication, considering the results of previous audits, detecting 
material misstatements from violations or abuse, developing elements of a finding, and audit 
documentation. 
 
Detecting Material Misstatements Resulting from Violations of Provisions of Contracts or Grant Agreements or from Abuse 
4.10 Auditors should design the audit to provide reasonable assurance of detecting 
misstatements that result from violations of provisions of contracts or grant 
agreements and could have a direct and material effect on the determination of 
financial statement amounts or other financial data significant to the audit objectives. 
Financial Transactions  Public Sector Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1903 
4.11  If specific information comes to the auditors’ attention that provides evidence 
concerning the existence of possible violations of provisions of contracts or grant 
agreements that could have a material indirect effect on the financial statements, the 
auditors should apply audit procedures specifically directed to ascertaining whether 
such violations have occurred. When the auditors conclude that a violation of 
provisions of contracts or grant agreements has or is likely to have occurred, they 
should determine the effect on the financial statements as well as the implications for 
other aspects of the audit. 
4.12  Abuse involves behavior that is deficient or improper when compared with behavior 
that a prudent person would consider reasonable and necessary business practice 
given the facts and circumstances. Abuse also includes misuse of authority or 
position for personal financial interests or those of an immediate or close family 
member or business associate. Abuse does not necessarily involve fraud, violation of 
laws, regulations, or provisions of a contract or grant agreement. 
4.13 If during the course of the audit, auditors become aware of abuse that could be 
quantitatively or qualitatively material to the financial statements, auditors should 
apply audit procedures specifically directed to ascertain the potential effect on the 
financial statements or other financial data significant to the audit objectives. After 
performing additional work, auditors may discover that the abuse represents 
potential fraud or illegal acts. Because the determination of abuse is subjective, 
auditors are not required to provide reasonable assurance of detecting abuse. 
 
Developing Elements of a Finding 
4.14 Audit findings may involve deficiencies in internal control, fraud, illegal acts, 
violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, and abuse. The elements 
needed for a finding depend entirely on the objectives of the audit. Thus, a finding 
or set of findings is complete to the extent that the audit objectives are satisfied. 
When auditors identify deficiencies, auditors should plan and perform procedures to 
develop the elements of the findings that are relevant and necessary to achieve the 
audit objectives. The elements of an audit finding are discussed in paragraphs 4.15 
through 4.18. 
4.15 Criteria: The laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, standards, measures, 
expected performance, defined business practices, and benchmarks against which 
performance is compared or evaluated. Criteria identify the required or desired state 
or expectation with respect to the program or operation. Criteria provide a context 
for evaluating evidence and understanding the findings. 
Public Sector Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1904                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
4.16 Condition: Condition is a situation that exists. The condition is determined and 
documented during the audit. 
4.17 Cause: The cause identifies the reason or explanation for the condition or the factor 
or factors responsible for the difference between the situation that exists (condition) 
and the required or desired state (criteria), which may also serve as a basis for 
recommendations for corrective actions. Common factors include poorly designed 
policies, procedures, or criteria; inconsistent, incomplete, or incorrect 
implementation; or factors beyond the control of program management. Auditors 
may assess whether the evidence provides a reasonable and convincing argument for 
why the stated cause is the key factor or factors contributing to the difference. 
4.18 Effect or potential effect: The effect is a clear, logical link to establish the impact or 
potential impact of the difference between the situation that exists (condition) and 
the required or desired state (criteria). The effect or potential effect identifies the 
outcomes or consequences of the condition. When the audit objectives include 
identifying the actual or potential consequences of a condition that varies (either 
positively or negatively) from the criteria identified in the audit, “effect” is a measure 
of those consequences. Effect or potential effect may be used to demonstrate the 
need for corrective action in response to identified problems or relevant risks. 
 
Consideration of Fraud and Illegal Acts 
4.27  Under both the AICPA standards and GAGAS, auditors should plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are 
free of material misstatement, whether caused by error or fraud. Recognizing the 
possibility that a material misstatement due to fraud could be present is important 
for achieving this objective. However, absolute assurance is not attainable and thus 
even a properly planned and performed audit may not detect a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud. 
4.28 Under both the AICPA standards and GAGAS, auditors should design the audit to 
provide reasonable assurance of detecting material misstatements resulting from 
illegal acts that could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. If 
specific information comes to the auditors’ attention that provides evidence 
concerning the existence of possible illegal acts that could have a material indirect 
effect on the financial statements, the auditors should apply audit procedures 
specifically directed to ascertaining whether an illegal act has occurred. When an 
illegal act has or is likely to have occurred, auditors should determine the effect on 
the financial statements as well as the implications for other aspects of the audit. 
Financial Transactions  Public Sector Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1905 
Reporting Standards for Financial Audits — Chapter 5 
GAGAS reporting standards for financial audits include four AICPA generally accepted 
standards of reporting and eight other standards specific to government financial audits. The 
additional GAGAS standards relate to: 
• Reporting auditors’ compliance with GAGAS; 
• Reporting on internal control and on compliance with laws, regulations, and provisions 
of contracts or grant agreements; 
• Reporting deficiencies in internal control, fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of 
contracts or grant agreements, or abuse; 
• Communicating significant matters in the auditors’ report; 
• Reporting on restatement of previously-issued financial statements; 
• Reporting views of responsible officials; 
• Reporting confidential or sensitive information; and 
• Distributing reports. 
 
Reporting Deficiencies in Internal Control, Fraud, Illegal Acts, Violations of Provisions of Contracts or Grant Agreements, and Abuse 
5.10  For financial audits, including audits of financial statements in which auditors 
provide an opinion or disclaimer, auditors should report, as applicable to the 
objectives of the audit, and based upon the audit work performed, (1) significant 
deficiencies in internal control, identifying those considered to be material 
weaknesses; (2) all instances of fraud and illegal acts unless inconsequential; and (3) 
violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements and abuse that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements. 
 
FRAUD, ILLEGAL ACTS, VIOLATIONS OF PROVISIONS OF CONTRACTS OR GRANT AGREEMENTS, AND ABUSE 
5.15  Under AICPA standards and GAGAS, auditors have responsibilities for detecting 
fraud and illegal acts that have a material effect on the financial statements and 
determining whether those charged with governance are adequately informed about 
fraud and illegal acts. GAGAS include additional reporting standards. When auditors 
conclude, based on sufficient, appropriate evidence, that any of the following either 
has occurred or is likely to have occurred, they should include in their audit report 
the relevant information about 
a. Fraud and illegal acts that have an effect on the financial statements that is more 
than inconsequential, 
Public Sector Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1906                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
b. Fraud and illegal acts that have an effect on the financial statements that is more 
than inconsequential, determination of financial statement amounts or other 
financial data significant to the audit, and 
c. Abuse that is material, either quantitatively or qualitatively. 
5.16  When auditors detect violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements or 
abuse that have an effect on the financial statements that is less than material but 
more than inconsequential, they should communicate those findings in writing to 
officials of the audited entity. Determining whether and how to communicate to 
officials of the audited entity fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts 
or grant agreements, or abuse that is inconsequential is a matter of professional 
judgment. Auditors should document such communications. 
5.17 When fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or 
abuse either have occurred or are likely to have occurred, auditors may consult with 
authorities or legal counsel about whether publicly reporting such information would 
compromise investigative or legal proceedings. Auditors may limit their public 
reporting to matters that would not compromise those proceedings, and for 
example, report only on information that is already a part of the public record. 
 
REPORTING FINDINGS DIRECTLY TO PARTIES OUTSIDE THE AUDITED ENTITY 
5.18  Auditors should report known or likely fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of 
contracts or grant agreements, or abuse directly to parties outside the audited entity 
in the following two circumstances: 
a. When entity management fails to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements to 
report such information to external parties specified in law or regulation, auditors 
should first communicate the failure to report such information to those charged 
with governance. If the audited entity still does not report this information to the 
specified external parties as soon as practicable after the auditors’ 
communication with those charged with governance, then the auditors should 
report the information directly to the specified external parties. 
b. When entity management fails to take timely and appropriate steps to respond to 
known or likely fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant 
agreements, or abuse that (1) is likely to have a material effect on the financial 
statements and (2) involves funding received directly or indirectly from a 
government agency, auditors should first report management’s failure to take 
timely and appropriate steps to those charged with governance. If the audited 
entity still does not take timely and appropriate steps as soon as practicable after 
Financial Transactions  Public Sector Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1907 
the auditors’ communication with those charged with governance, then the 
auditors should report the entity’s failure to take timely and appropriate steps 
directly to the funding agency. 
5.19  The reporting in paragraph 5.18 is in addition to any legal requirements to report 
such information directly to parties outside the audited entity. Auditors should 
comply with these requirements even if they have resigned or been dismissed from 
the audit prior to its completion. 
5.20  Auditors should obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence, such as confirmation from 
outside parties, to corroborate assertions by management of the audited entity that it 
has reported such findings in accordance with laws, regulations, and funding 
agreements. When auditors are unable to do so, they should report such information 
directly as discussed in paragraph 5.18. 
 
PRESENTING FINDINGS IN THE AUDITORS’ REPORT 
5.21  In presenting findings such as deficiencies in internal control, fraud, illegal acts, 
violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, and abuse, auditors should 
develop the elements of the findings to the extent necessary to achieve the audit 
objectives. Clearly developed audit findings, as discussed in paragraphs 4.14 through 
4.18, assist management or oversight officials of the audited entity in understanding 
the need for taking corrective action. If auditors sufficiently develop the elements of 
a finding, they may provide recommendations for corrective action. 
5.22 Auditors should place their findings in perspective by describing the nature and 
extent of the issues being reported and the extent of the work performed that 
resulted in the finding. To give the reader a basis for judging the prevalence and 
consequences of these findings, auditors should, as applicable, relate the instances 
identified to the population or the number of cases examined and quantify the results 
in terms of dollar value or other measures, as appropriate. If the results cannot be 
projected, auditors should limit their conclusions appropriately. 
 
Field Work Standards for Performance Audits — Chapter 7 
GAGAS has adopted four field work standards for performance audits. The field work 
standards for performance audits relate to planning the audit; supervising staff; obtaining 
sufficient, appropriate evidence; and preparing audit documentation. 
 
Public Sector Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1908                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Audit Risk 
7.05  Audit risk is the possibility that the auditors’ findings, conclusions, 
recommendations, or assurance may be improper or incomplete, as a result of 
factors such as evidence that is not sufficient and/or appropriate, an inadequate audit 
process, or intentional omissions or misleading information due to misrepresentation 
or fraud. The assessment of audit risk involves both qualitative and quantitative 
considerations. Factors such as the time frames, complexity, or sensitivity of the 
work; size of the program in terms of dollar amounts and number of citizens served; 
adequacy of the audited entity’s systems and processes to detect inconsistencies, 
significant errors, or fraud; and auditors’ access to records, also impact audit risk. 
Audit risk includes the risk that auditors will not detect a mistake, inconsistency, 
significant error, or fraud in the evidence supporting the audit. Audit risk can be 
reduced by taking actions such as increasing the scope of work; adding experts, 
additional reviewers, and other resources to the audit team; changing the 
methodology to obtain additional evidence, higher quality evidence, or alternative 
forms of corroborating evidence; or aligning the findings and conclusions to reflect 
the evidence obtained. 
 
Planning
7.11  Auditors should assess audit risk and significance within the context of the audit 
objectives by gaining an understanding of the following: 
a. the nature and profile of the programs and the needs of potential users of the 
audit report; 
b. internal control as it relates to the specific objectives and scope of the audit; 
c. information systems controls for purposes of assessing audit risk and planning 
the audit within the context of the audit objectives; 
d. legal and regulatory requirements, contract provisions or grant agreements, 
potential fraud, or abuse that are significant within the context of the audit 
objectives; and 
e. the results of previous audits and attestation engagements that directly relate to 
the current audit objectives. 
 
Financial Transactions  Public Sector Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1909 
LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, PROVISIONS OF CONTRACTS OR GRANT AGREEMENTS, FRAUD, OR ABUSE
7.30  In planning the audit, auditors should assess risks of fraud occurring that is 
significant within the context of the audit objectives. Audit team members should 
discuss among the team fraud risks, including factors such as individuals’ incentives 
or pressures to commit fraud, the opportunity for fraud to occur, and 
rationalizations or attitudes that could allow individuals to commit fraud. Auditors 
should gather and assess information to identify risks of fraud that are significant 
within the scope of the audit objectives or that could affect the findings and 
conclusions. For example, auditors may obtain information through discussion with 
officials of the audited entity or through other means to determine the susceptibility 
of the program to fraud, the status of internal controls the entity has established to 
detect and prevent fraud, or the risk that officials of the audited entity could override 
internal control. An attitude of professional skepticism in assessing these risks assists 
auditors in assessing which factors or risks could significantly affect the audit 
objectives. 
7.31  When auditors identify factors or risks related to fraud that has occurred or is likely 
to have occurred that they believe are significant within the context of the audit 
objectives, they should design procedures to provide reasonable assurance of 
detecting such fraud. Assessing the risk of fraud is an ongoing process throughout 
the audit and relates not only to planning the audit but also to evaluating evidence 
obtained during the audit. 
7.32  When information comes to the auditors’ attention indicating that fraud that is 
significant within the context of the audit objectives may have occurred, auditors 
should extend the audit steps and procedures, as necessary, to (1) determine whether 
fraud has likely occurred and (2) if so, determine its effect on the audit findings. If 
the fraud that may have occurred is not significant within the context of the audit 
objectives, the auditors may conduct additional audit work as a separate engagement, 
or refer the matter to other parties with oversight responsibility or jurisdiction. 
 
Reporting Standards for Performance Audits — Chapter 8 
According to GAGAS, the reporting standards for performance audits relate to the form of 
the report, the report contents, and report issuance and distribution.  
 
Public Sector Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1910                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Reporting Findings 
8.18  Auditors should report deficiencies in internal control that are significant within the 
context of the objectives of the audit, all instances of fraud, illegal acts unless they 
are inconsequential within the context of the audit objectives, significant violations 
of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, and significant abuse that have 
occurred or are likely to have occurred. 
 
FRAUD, ILLEGAL ACTS, VIOLATIONS OF PROVISIONS OF CONTRACTS OR GRANT AGREEMENTS, AND ABUSE 
8.21  When auditors conclude, based on sufficient, appropriate evidence, that fraud, illegal 
acts, significant violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or 
significant abuse either has occurred or is likely to have occurred, they should report 
the matter as a finding. 
8.22  When auditors detect violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or 
abuse that are not significant, they should communicate those findings in writing to 
officials of the audited entity unless the findings are inconsequential within the 
context of the audit objectives, considering both qualitative and quantitative factors. 
Determining whether or how to communicate to officials of the audited entity fraud, 
illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or abuse that is 
inconsequential is a matter of the auditors’ professional judgment. Auditors should 
document such communications. 
8.23  When fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or 
abuse either have occurred or are likely to have occurred, auditors may consult with 
authorities or legal counsel about whether publicly reporting such information would 
compromise investigative or legal proceedings. Auditors may limit their public 
reporting to matters that would not compromise those proceedings, and for 
example, report only on information that is already a part of the public record. 
 
REPORTING FINDINGS DIRECTLY TO PARTIES OUTSIDE THE AUDITED ENTITY 
8.24 Auditors should report known or likely fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of 
contracts or grant agreements, or abuse directly to parties outside the audited entity 
in the following two circumstances. 
a. When entity management fails to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements to 
report such information to external parties specified in law or regulation, auditors 
should first communicate the failure to report such information to those charged 
with governance. If the audited entity still does not report this information to the 
Financial Transactions  Public Sector Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1911 
specified external parties as soon as practicable after the auditors’ 
communication with those charged with governance, then the auditors should 
report the information directly to the specified external parties. 
b. When entity management fails to take timely and appropriate steps to respond to 
known or likely fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant 
agreements, or abuse that (1) is significant to the findings and conclusions, and 
(2) involves funding received directly or indirectly from a government agency, 
auditors should first report management’s failure to take timely and appropriate 
steps to those charged with governance. If the audited entity still does not take 
timely and appropriate steps as soon as practicable after the auditors’ 
communication with those charged with governance, then the auditors should 
report the entity’s failure to take timely and appropriate steps directly to the 
funding agency. 
8.25 The reporting in paragraph 8.24 is in addition to any legal requirements to report 
such information directly to parties outside the audited entity. Auditors should 
comply with these requirements even if they have resigned or been dismissed from 
the audit prior to its completion. 
8.26 Auditors should obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence, such as confirmation from 
outside parties, to corroborate assertions by management of the audited entity that it 
has reported such findings in accordance with laws, regulations, and funding 
agreements. When auditors are unable to do so, they should report such information 
directly as discussed in paragraph 8.24.
