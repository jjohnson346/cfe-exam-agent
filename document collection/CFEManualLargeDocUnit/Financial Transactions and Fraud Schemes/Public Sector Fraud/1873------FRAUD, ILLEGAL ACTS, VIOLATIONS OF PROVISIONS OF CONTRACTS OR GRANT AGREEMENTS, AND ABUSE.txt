FRAUD, ILLEGAL ACTS, VIOLATIONS OF PROVISIONS OF CONTRACTS OR GRANT AGREEMENTS, AND ABUSE 
8.21  When auditors conclude, based on sufficient, appropriate evidence, that fraud, illegal 
acts, significant violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or 
significant abuse either has occurred or is likely to have occurred, they should report 
the matter as a finding. 
8.22  When auditors detect violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or 
abuse that are not significant, they should communicate those findings in writing to 
officials of the audited entity unless the findings are inconsequential within the 
context of the audit objectives, considering both qualitative and quantitative factors. 
Determining whether or how to communicate to officials of the audited entity fraud, 
illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or abuse that is 
inconsequential is a matter of the auditors’ professional judgment. Auditors should 
document such communications. 
8.23  When fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or 
abuse either have occurred or are likely to have occurred, auditors may consult with 
authorities or legal counsel about whether publicly reporting such information would 
compromise investigative or legal proceedings. Auditors may limit their public 
reporting to matters that would not compromise those proceedings, and for 
example, report only on information that is already a part of the public record.
