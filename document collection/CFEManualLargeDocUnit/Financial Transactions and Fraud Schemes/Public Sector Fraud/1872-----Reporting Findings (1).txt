Reporting Findings 
8.18  Auditors should report deficiencies in internal control that are significant within the 
context of the objectives of the audit, all instances of fraud, illegal acts unless they 
are inconsequential within the context of the audit objectives, significant violations 
of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, and significant abuse that have 
occurred or are likely to have occurred. 
 
FRAUD, ILLEGAL ACTS, VIOLATIONS OF PROVISIONS OF CONTRACTS OR GRANT AGREEMENTS, AND ABUSE 
8.21  When auditors conclude, based on sufficient, appropriate evidence, that fraud, illegal 
acts, significant violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or 
significant abuse either has occurred or is likely to have occurred, they should report 
the matter as a finding. 
8.22  When auditors detect violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or 
abuse that are not significant, they should communicate those findings in writing to 
officials of the audited entity unless the findings are inconsequential within the 
context of the audit objectives, considering both qualitative and quantitative factors. 
Determining whether or how to communicate to officials of the audited entity fraud, 
illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or abuse that is 
inconsequential is a matter of the auditors’ professional judgment. Auditors should 
document such communications. 
8.23  When fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or 
abuse either have occurred or are likely to have occurred, auditors may consult with 
authorities or legal counsel about whether publicly reporting such information would 
compromise investigative or legal proceedings. Auditors may limit their public 
reporting to matters that would not compromise those proceedings, and for 
example, report only on information that is already a part of the public record. 
 
REPORTING FINDINGS DIRECTLY TO PARTIES OUTSIDE THE AUDITED ENTITY 
8.24 Auditors should report known or likely fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of 
contracts or grant agreements, or abuse directly to parties outside the audited entity 
in the following two circumstances. 
a. When entity management fails to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements to 
report such information to external parties specified in law or regulation, auditors 
should first communicate the failure to report such information to those charged 
with governance. If the audited entity still does not report this information to the 
Financial Transactions  Public Sector Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1911 
specified external parties as soon as practicable after the auditors’ 
communication with those charged with governance, then the auditors should 
report the information directly to the specified external parties. 
b. When entity management fails to take timely and appropriate steps to respond to 
known or likely fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant 
agreements, or abuse that (1) is significant to the findings and conclusions, and 
(2) involves funding received directly or indirectly from a government agency, 
auditors should first report management’s failure to take timely and appropriate 
steps to those charged with governance. If the audited entity still does not take 
timely and appropriate steps as soon as practicable after the auditors’ 
communication with those charged with governance, then the auditors should 
report the entity’s failure to take timely and appropriate steps directly to the 
funding agency. 
8.25 The reporting in paragraph 8.24 is in addition to any legal requirements to report 
such information directly to parties outside the audited entity. Auditors should 
comply with these requirements even if they have resigned or been dismissed from 
the audit prior to its completion. 
8.26 Auditors should obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence, such as confirmation from 
outside parties, to corroborate assertions by management of the audited entity that it 
has reported such findings in accordance with laws, regulations, and funding 
agreements. When auditors are unable to do so, they should report such information 
directly as discussed in paragraph 8.24.
