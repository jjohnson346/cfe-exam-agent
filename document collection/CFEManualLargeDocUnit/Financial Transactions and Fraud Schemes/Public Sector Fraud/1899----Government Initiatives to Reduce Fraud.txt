Government Initiatives to Reduce Fraud 
 
The Department of Defense (DoD) 
This department, long notorious for its waste and abuse, has dramatically increased its fraud 
detection and prevention efforts in recent years. A full complement of auditors and 
investigators are assigned to detect and prevent fraud. Contract officers are trained to 
recognize and required to promptly report any possibly fraudulent situations. Major 
government contractors are assigned a DoD auditor who works on-site, increasing the 
chances of possible procurement fraud being reported. The measures taken to combat fraud 
in this agency have proven quite effective, with increased prosecution and recovery. 
 
Within the DoD, several investigative agencies exist:  
• Defense Criminal Investigative Service 
• Air Force Office of Special Investigations  
• Army Criminal Investigation Command 
• Naval Criminal Investigative Services 
 
In addition to their other investigative duties, each of these agencies pursues fraud cases 
involving military personnel, civilian employees, and contractors. 
 
Voluntary Disclosure 
The Voluntary Disclosure Program was begun by DoD in 1986 and allows contractors to 
inform DoD of irregularities. While the program does not state that voluntary disclosure will 
exempt contractors from prosecution or suspension, it does note that voluntary disclosure 
and full cooperation “are strong indications of an attitude of contractor integrity even in the 
wake of disclosures of potential criminal liability.” 
 
Certain criteria exist for contractors to claim they made a voluntary disclosure. While 
voluntary disclosure of wrongdoing may not exempt a corporation from prosecution, it 
certainly is a contributing factor in the decision of whether to prosecute. The criteria include 
that:  
• The admission must come from the corporation, not an individual employee.  
• Any disclosure precipitated by the knowledge that news of the fraud may soon leak out 
and cause a government investigation would not allow the contractor to claim voluntary 
disclosure.  
• After the disclosure has been made, the corporation must take immediate steps to

correct the damage done the government and discipline the offending parties.  
• Full cooperation with the government investigation is essential. 
 
Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) 
The DCAA is essentially an audit agency that reviews procurement contracts. It has the 
authority to subpoena contractors’ records if fraud is suspected. Government suppliers with 
large contracts usually are assigned their own DCAA auditor. The Defense Contract Audit 
Manual explains fraud reporting procedures for DCAA auditors. Reports of fraud are passed 
to DCAA Counsel and the Assistant Director and, from there, to the appropriate DoD or 
federal investigative branch. DCAA auditors are trained to look for: 
• Poor internal controls 
• Bad financial situations 
• Inadequate accounting records 
• Poor timekeeping system 
• A mix of commercial, fixed-price, and cost-type contracts 
• A background of fraud 
• Management dominated by one or a few individuals 
• Individuals with lavish lifestyles beyond their incomes 
• No or few internal and external audits 
 
Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) 
Larger go vernment contractors have staff from this agency stationed in their facilities. Their 
purpose there is to serve as contract administrators and inspection personnel. If a DLA 
employee working in this capacity suspects contract or procurement fraud, a report is made 
to DoD legal personnel. Fraud cases are investigated by the Defense Logistics Agency 
Criminal Investigations Activity (DCIA). 
 
The Department of Justice 
The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) is the federal government’s executive 
department that is responsible for enforcing the law and administrating justice. The DOJ is 
headed by the United States Attorney General. United States Attorneys, which are under the 
direction of the Attorney General, serve as the nation’s litigators. They conduct most of the 
trial work in which the United States is a party, including the prosecution of fraud cases. 
They also indict individuals, negotiate settlements, and recover damages. 
 
Financial Transactions  Public Sector Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1921 
The DOJ and the federal government have increased their efforts to curb fraud and abuse in 
the federal spending. In 2006, for example, the Department of Justice (DOJ) formed the 
National Procurement Fraud Task Force to promote the early detection, prevention, and 
prosecution of procurement fraud. Since its creation, more than 300 procurement fraud 
cases have resulted in criminal convictions and the recovery of hundreds of millions of 
dollars in civil settlements and judgments. Also, President Obama recently clarified his 
position on procurement fraud by ordering an overhaul of the federal contracting system, 
vowing to “strengthen oversight to maximize transparency and accountability.” 
Furthermore, according to a report issued by the Office of the Attorney General (“National 
Priorities for the Investigation and Prosecution of White Collar Crime”), procurement fraud 
has been a primary area of investigative efforts by the DOJ since 1980. 
 
Such efforts are necessary because the federal government spends trillions of dollars each 
year on a wide variety of programs (e.g., national defense and homeland security, Social 
Security, Medicare and Medicaid, anti-poverty programs, interest on the national debt, 
education, veterans’ spending, unemployment  benefits, farm subsidies, etc.), and such 
expenditures create numerous opportunities for corrupt players to commit procurement 
fraud against the government. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), 
losses from fraud, misuse, and other types of improper payments are about $100 billion a 
year. 
 
Moreover, federal expenditures are increasing. During fiscal year (FY) 2009, the federal 
government spent about $3.52 trillion, up 18 percent from FY 2008, and the federal 
government is projected to spend $3.6 trillion in FY 2010. Thus, the threat of government 
fraud schemes is also increasing, and, as a result, there is a growing need to detect, prevent, 
and prosecute this type of fraud. 
 
The government’s message is clear: offenders will be prosecuted and punished to the full 
extent of the law.  
 
Divisions 
The DOJ is comprised of several divisions, including the Criminal Division and the Civil 
Division.  
 
The Criminal Division, which is headed by an Assistant Attorney General, is responsible for 
enforcing federal criminal laws.  
Public Sector Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1922                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Within the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, two offices are primarily occupied with 
white-collar crime: the Public Integrity Secti on and the Fraud Section. The Public Integrity 
Section reviews anti-fraud programs involving white-collar crimes by public officials. The 
Fraud Section’s duties include: 
• Investigating and prosecuting complex, sensitive, or multi-district cases involving major 
white-collar crimes either developed by the section or as requested by U.S. Attorney’s 
offices. 
• Providing training to federal, state, and local investigators and prosecutors. 
• Developing and implementing national white-collar crime enforcement policies. 
 
The Civil Division of the DOJ represents the federal government in civil cases. According to 
its website, the Civil Division’s “litigation reflects the diversity of government activities, 
involving, for example, the defense of challenges to Presidential actions; national security 
issues; benefit programs; energy policies; commercial issues such as contract disputes, 
banking insurance, patents, fraud, and debt collection; all manner of accident and liability 
claims; enforcement of immigration laws; and civil and criminal violations of consumer 
protection laws.” 
 
The Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General  
The Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (OIG) 
investigates federal Medicaid fraud cases, it oversees state Medicaid Fraud Control Units, it 
can sanction fraudulent providers by imposing exclusions and civil monetary penalties, and it 
refers its investigative findings to the DOJ. 
 
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Control Program  
The Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Control Program (HCFAC), which is jointly directed by 
the DOJ and the OIG, oversees state Medicaid  agencies and provides ongoing forums and 
training for state officials on fraud control. 
 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is a federal agency wi thin the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, it provides each state with technical assistance, 
guidance, and oversight for Medicare/Medicaid fraud prevention and detection efforts, it 
oversees each state’s fraud and abuse efforts, it keeps the Medicaid Alliance for Program 
Safeguards, which provides assistance against fraud and abuse, in working order, and it 
provides a national forum for Medicaid fraud and abuse issues.

Federal Investigative Agencies 
In the United States, several federal agencies have investigative jurisdiction over white-collar 
crime cases. Some of the primary investigative agencies are discussed below.  
 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation 
As the principal investigative arm of the DOJ, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
investigates federal fraud cases, and it refers its investigative findings to the United States 
Attorney’s Office.  
 
The Inspectors General 
In the United States, many agencies use Inspectors General (IGs) to conduct investigations 
of misconduct, waste, fraud, theft, and certain types of criminal activity related to the 
agency’s operations.  
 
The Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigative Division 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Investigative Division investigates potential 
criminal violations of the Internal Revenue Code and related financial crimes.
