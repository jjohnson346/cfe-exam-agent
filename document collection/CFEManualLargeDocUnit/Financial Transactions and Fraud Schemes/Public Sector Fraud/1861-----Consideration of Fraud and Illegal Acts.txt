Consideration of Fraud and Illegal Acts 
4.27  Under both the AICPA standards and GAGAS, auditors should plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are 
free of material misstatement, whether caused by error or fraud. Recognizing the 
possibility that a material misstatement due to fraud could be present is important 
for achieving this objective. However, absolute assurance is not attainable and thus 
even a properly planned and performed audit may not detect a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud. 
4.28 Under both the AICPA standards and GAGAS, auditors should design the audit to 
provide reasonable assurance of detecting material misstatements resulting from 
illegal acts that could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. If 
specific information comes to the auditors’ attention that provides evidence 
concerning the existence of possible illegal acts that could have a material indirect 
effect on the financial statements, the auditors should apply audit procedures 
specifically directed to ascertaining whether an illegal act has occurred. When an 
illegal act has or is likely to have occurred, auditors should determine the effect on 
the financial statements as well as the implications for other aspects of the audit.
