Loan Increases or Extensions, Replacement Loans 
A loan being continually extended and loan increases being made simultaneously might 
indicate that the real estate project cannot support the debt service. Typically, the loan 
increases are to pay for the interest and extension fee. This red flag might also indicate that 
the loan was made to a related-party or made as a loan to hasten a sale or other transaction. 
In other words, the loan was not properly underwritten. 
If the loan is increased and extended several times, it might indicate that higher appraisals are 
being obtained on a “made-as-instructed” basis. Loan increases and extensions might be the 
method used by the lender to conceal a nonperforming loan. 
 
However, according to William T. Thornhill, CFE, a consultant in the field of financial 
institution fraud, fraud perpetrators tend to write a new loan or credit facility to replace  an 
existing or old loan because they are aware of the fact that a rewrite may attract loan review, 
loan administration, or internal audit attention. Accordingly, replacement loans are now 
increasingly used rather than a simple rewrite of a loan.
