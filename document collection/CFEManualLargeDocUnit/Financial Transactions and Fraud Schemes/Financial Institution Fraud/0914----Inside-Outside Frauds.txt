Inside/Outside Frauds 
Outside/inside frauds is an area where fraud is increasing, in which the employee (insider) 
might be co-opted through a bribe or a threat of violence against the insider or a family 
member. Sometimes the insider is a bank teller who agrees to cash certain items as long as 
the items look reasonable and are below a cashing limit. Other times the insider is a proof 
operator or sorter operator who inserts documents directly into the computer system to

affect fraudulent deposits. Or, the insider is selling copies of documents to individuals who 
use computer techniques to make fraudulent items. 
 
Account Information Frauds 
Information is sold to organized rings or insiders who use the information themselves. As 
financial institutions make more services available to customers and strive to make them 
more usable, information about customer account relationships reside in many forms, such 
as 24-hour customer operators, online systems, printed documents that are innocently put in 
the trash only to be retrieved, or credit card information on high line cards. 
 
Trading Activities 
Trading activities can be compromised to defraud banks. Usually perpetrated with the 
assistance of an internal employee or by an employee acting alone, trading can include 
foreign exchange, securities trading, loan sales, and securitization. Often when this type of 
problem is suspected, the investigator must turn to traders themselves as the only source to 
gather information.
