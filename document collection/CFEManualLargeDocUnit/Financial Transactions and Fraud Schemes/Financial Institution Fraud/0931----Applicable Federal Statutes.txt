Applicable Federal Statutes 
There are many federal statutes related to fraud and false statements involving financial 
institutions. The following are some common federal statutes employed in the prosecution 
of bank fraud.  
 
Bank Fraud, Title 18, U.S. Code, § 1344 
Section 1344 is the broadest of all bank fraud statutes. It punishes those obtaining assets 
owned or controlled by a bank by false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises. 
It covers both insiders and all other persons, even if not affiliated with the bank 
It also applies to check kiting and to off-shore frauds (extraterritorial reach). Bank fraud is a 
predicate offense under RICO (Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization Statute). 
Penalties for bank fraud include a fine up to $1 million and/or imprisonment of up to 30 
years. 
 
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA), Title 12, 
U.S. Code, § 1811, et seq. 
This legislation greatly strengthens the prosecutorial arm against insiders and outsiders. The 
law’s provisions are applicable to any institution-affiliated party, which includes (but is not 
Financial Transactions  Financial Institution Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.945 
limited to) directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Institution-affiliated 
parties can include attorneys, accountants, and appraisers. 
 
FIRREA provides for enhanced civil and criminal penalties for convictions of several bank-related 
statutes. The civil penalties can be $1  million per day, or a total of $5 million for 
continuing violations, or the amount of wrongful gain or loss. The maximum criminal 
penalty is either a fine of $1 million or 30 years imprisonment, or both. 
 
Crime Control Act of 1990, Title 12, U.S. Code, § 1821(d)(17)-(19) 
This Act defines a host of crimes and increases the maximum penalties on other offenses. 
For example, the maximum prison term for financial crimes was increased from 5 years to 
20 years. These penalties, however, do not become effective for offenses committed prior to 
the effective date of this law. Thus far, no court decisions have been made regarding these 
increased penalties. This statute amended the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization 
law (RICO), making bank fraud a predicate offense under RICO. 
 
Financial Institution Anti-Fraud Enforcement Act of 1990, Title 12, U.S. Code, § 4 201, et seq. 
This statute sets out procedures for rewarding private parties for reporting violations and 
providing information concerning the recovery of assets. The statute also allows for the 
hiring of private counsel to investigate and prosecute civil claims. 
 
Continuing Financial Crime Enterprise Statute, Title 18, U.S. Code, § 225 
Also known as the “S&L Kingpin” sta tute, the law provides for fines of up to $20 million 
for organizational defendants and fines of up to $10 million and up to life imprisonment for 
individual defendants receiving $5 million or more during a 24-month period from a criminal 
enterprise. A criminal enterprise  is defined as a series of enumerated crimes related to  
financial institutions. 
 
Embezzlement, Misapplication, and False Entries 
Title 18, U.S. Code, §§ 656 and 657 
These Sections cover theft, embezzlement, or misapplication by a bank officer or employee. 
Violations are punishable by up to 30 years in prison and/or fined up to $1 million.

Title 18, U.S. Code, §§ 1001, 1005, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1014 
These statutes include all provisions that punish false or fraudulent statements orally or in 
writing to various federal agencies and federally insured financial institutions. Usually these 
result from efforts to conceal embezzlements and misapplications. 
 
Title 18, U.S. Code, § 1032, Concealment of Assets 
This statute prohibits any person from corruptly attempting to conceal assets or impede 
their recovery. Violations are punishable by  up to five years in prison plus fines. 
 
Participation in the Affairs of a Financial Institution by a Convicted Felon, Title 12, 
U.S. Code, § 1829 
This statute bars people with banking crime convictions from participating in the conduct of 
the affairs of a financial institution, with certain exceptions. A knowing violation might result 
in fines of up to $1 million per day and imprisonment of up to five years. 
 
Offer of Loan or Gratuity to a Bank Examiner, Title 18, U.S. Code, § 212 
Bank officers, directors, and employees are prohibited from giving a loan or gratuity to a 
bank examiner or assistant. Section 213 forbids an examiner or assistant from accepting a 
loan or gratuity. Both offenses are punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 or the amount loaned 
or given and up to a year’s imprisonment. 
 
Receipt of Commissions or Gifts for Procuring Loans, Title 18, U.S. Code, § 215  
The corrupt giving or receiving of anything of value to influence an officer, director, 
employee, agent, or attorney of a financial institution is punishable by fines of the greater of 
three times the value of the thing given or no more than $1 million and/or up to 30  
years imprisonment.

Red Flag Rules 
In 2007, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued final rules and guidelines (Red Flag 
Rules) implementing sections 114 and 315 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act 
(FACTA). The Red Flag Rules require financial institutions and certain creditors to develop 
and implement a formal written program to identify, detect, and respond to red flags of 
possible identity theft. 
 
Although the Red Flag Rules apply primarily to financial institutions, they also apply to any 
creditor with covered accounts. The definition of creditor  includes any entity that “regularly 
extends, renews, or continues credit” or that “regularly arranges for the extension, renewal, 
or continuation of credit,” including banking in stitutions, mortgage lenders, retailers, utility 
companies, car dealers, and debt collectors. A covered account  is an account primarily used for 
personal, family, or household purposes and that involves multiple payments or transactions, 
including credit card accounts, mortgage loans, car loans, cell phone accounts, utility 
accounts, and savings accounts. Therefore, even if a business is not a financial services 
entity, management should determine whether the entity is a creditor under the Red Flag 
Rules.  
 
To comply with the Red Flag Rules, financial institutions and creditors with covered 
accounts must implement written identity theft prevention programs that are tailored to each 
entity’s size, complexity, and nature. These organizations must also adopt “reasonable 
policies and procedures” that:  
• Identify relevant red flags for covered accounts and incorporate them into the 
prevention program. 
Financial Institution Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.948                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• Detect red flags that have been incorporated into the prevention program. 
• Respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity 
theft. 
• Ensure the prevention program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to 
customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from 
identity theft. 
 
The Red Flag Rules also provides 26 examples of possible red flags that financial institutions 
and creditors should consider when implementing their programs. The examples are listed 
below:   
1. A fraud alert  
2. Notice of a credit freeze  
3. Notice of an address discrepancy. 
4. Unusual credit activity 
5. Identification documents appear altered or forged. 
6. ID photograph and customer appearance appear inconsistent 
7. Information presented by customer and information on ID are inconsistent 
8. Information on ID is inconsistent with information on file 
9. Application appears forged or altered 
10. Personal information on ID is inconsistent with external information sources  
11. Lack of correlation between Social Security number range and date of birth. 
12. Personal identifying information is associated with known fraud activity. 
13. Suspicious addresses supplied 
14. Provided Social Security number matches number submitted by another person  
15. Address or phone number matches that supplied by other customers 
16. In response to notice that application is incomplete, customer is unable to supply 
identifying information  
17. Personal information inconsistent with information already on file  
18. Customer unable to answer challenge questions 
19. Shortly after change of address, creditor receives request for the addition of authorized 
account users 
20. Most of available credit used for cash advances, jewelry, or electronics, or customer fails 
to make first payment 
21. Inconsistent activity patterns 
22. Previously inactive accounts suddenly becoming active

23. Mail sent to customer repeatedly returned as undeliverable even though transactions 
continue on active account 
24. Notice that customer is not receiving paper account statements
