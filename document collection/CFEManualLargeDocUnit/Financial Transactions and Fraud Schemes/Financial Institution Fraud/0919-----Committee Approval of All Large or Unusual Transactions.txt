Committee Approval of All Large or Unusual Transactions 
If a loan committee or a board-of-directors committee is responsible for approving loans 
and other large or unusual transactions, then insiders will have a more difficult time 
perpetrating large fraud and the transactions submitted by external fraudsters will be subject 
to another layer of independent review.
