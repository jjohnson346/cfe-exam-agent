Determining “Value”  
Value is comprised of four elements: utility, scarcity, demand, and transferability. Real estate 
appraisals assign three types of values to property. They are: 
 
FAIR MARKET VALUE 
This is the price the property would bring if freely offered on the open market with both a 
willing seller and a willing buyer. (Estimated) 
 
SALES PRICE 
Sales price is the price paid for the property. It might be higher or lower than fair market 
value. (Actual) 
 
LOAN VALUE 
Loan value is the percentage of a property’s va lue (fair market value or sales price) a lender 
can or might loan a borrower.
