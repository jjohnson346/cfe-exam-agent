High Turnover in Tenant Mix 
If the tenant mix in a commercial project (such as a retail center or an office building) is 
suddenly undergoing a major change, there might be some problem with the management of 
the project or with the method of allocating the pass-through expenses, such as utilities or 
maintenance. In addition, a decline in the tenant mix might be an indication that the deferred 
maintenance for the project is not being properly attended to.
