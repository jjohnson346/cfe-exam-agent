Prevention 
Financial institutions, like other organizations, should have standard internal control 
measures to assist in the detection and deterrence of fraud. In addition to normal 
procedures, such as segregation of duties and budget and actual comparisons, listed below 
are some specific control measures that might enhance the detection and deterrence  
of fraud. 
 
Loan Origination, Underwriting, Closing, Disbursement, and Servicing Segregation 
By separating all of the functions relating to loans, a lending institution reduces the 
opportunity for an individual (insider) to perpetrate loan fraud. Additionally, the segregation 
provides for at least one, if not several, levels of independent review to reduce its external 
loan fraud exposure. 
 
Committee Approval of All Large or Unusual Transactions 
If a loan committee or a board-of-directors committee is responsible for approving loans 
and other large or unusual transactions, then insiders will have a more difficult time 
perpetrating large fraud and the transactions submitted by external fraudsters will be subject 
to another layer of independent review.

Transfer Journal Entries and Orders Review 
Regularly review all transfer journal entries and orders. As with an expense review, if a 
routine but unscheduled review occurs from time to time, then the fraudster loses the 
vehicle for concealment. 
 
Independent Review of Loans 
An independent review of loans provides a nonpartisan approach to all loan transactions. 
Either the internal or external auditors (or other consultants) can perform this independent 
review that allows for a “second opinion” on loan transactions. The reviews should be 
consistent and performed on a regular basis to help establish loan loss reserves. Typically, 
this loan review is established for loans for more than a certain dollar amount, such as 
$25,000 or $100,000. 
 
Management Review of Write-Offs 
Excessive write-offs are a form of concealment for phantom loans, conflicts of interest, and 
embezzlement. Therefore, if all write-offs are subject to management review before they are 
written off, then management reduces the potential environment for fraud.  
 
Routine Examination of Officers’ Accounts 
Routine examination of officers’ accounts might prevent fraud schemes such as wire transfer 
fraud, embezzlement, withdrawals from dormant accounts, conflicts of interest, and so on. 
This review can be performed when the officer is on mandatory vacation.  
 
Proper Lending Policies 
Employees should be trained in the proper (and regulated) lending policies of the institution. 
Any deviations from the policies will be red flags and will help to prevent loan fraud from 
both internal and external perpetrators. 
 
Document Requirements for Standard Transactions 
Deviations from normal or proscribed documentation should be an automatic red flag. Who 
better to recognize a potential fraud than the employees routinely handling the 
documentation? Therefore, employees should be well-educated in proper documentation for 
the transactions they are handling.

Information Verification (For Example, Loan Applications) 
Fraud potential could be eliminated or at the very least detected before companies suffer 
damages if the employee knows how to verify information. For example, if the loan officer 
advises a potential borrower that the information submitted on financial statements will be 
verified, the borrower will be less likely to submit false or fraudulent financial statements. 
Additionally, if a teller advises a depositor that the deposit will be verified before cash is paid 
out, then the incidence of split deposits can be reduced.  
 
Employee Training 
Fellow employees are generally the first people to recognize unusual transactions or behavior 
changes of other employees. These might be early indicators that a fraud has or will soon 
begin. Employees and managers should be properly trained to recognize these symptoms. 
For example, bank tellers should be adequately schooled in split deposit schemes; new 
account officers in new account schemes and so on. 
 
Standardized Procedures 
An institution can provide a low fraud environment by standardizing procedures in sensitive 
areas, as detailed below: 
• Loan application processing 
• Information required for loan approval 
• Credit report requests 
• Appraisals accepted from pre-approved list of vendors 
• Inspection reports on construction draw loans 
• Conflict of interest disclosure statements 
• Routine confirmation calls for 
? Wire transfers 
? Construction vendors 
• Confirmation of registered securities with registrar or transfer agent 
• Periodic physical inventory of securities
