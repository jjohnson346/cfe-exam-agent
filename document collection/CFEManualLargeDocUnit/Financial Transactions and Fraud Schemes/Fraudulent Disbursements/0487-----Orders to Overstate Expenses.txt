Orders to Overstate Expenses  
Finally, some employees knowingly falsify their own reports, but do so at the direction of 
their supervisors. The employees may be threatened with loss of their jobs if they do not go 
along with the scheme. Sometimes the supervisor splits the proceeds of the fraud with his 
subordinates. In other cases, the excess money goes into a slush fund or is used for some 
other business purpose that is not in the company budget. The supervisors who engage in 
these schemes often believe they are really acting in the best interests of their companies.  
 
EXAMPLE 
A sales executive instructed his salesmen to inflate their expenses in order to generate cash 
for a slush fund. This fund was used to pay bribes and to provide improper forms of 
entertainment for clients and customers.
