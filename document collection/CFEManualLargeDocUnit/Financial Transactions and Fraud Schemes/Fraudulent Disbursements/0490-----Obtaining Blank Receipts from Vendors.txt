Obtaining Blank Receipts from Vendors 
If the perpetrator does not create receipts, they can be obtained from legitimate suppliers in 
a number of ways. Some employees request blank receipts from waiters, bartenders, taxi cab 
drivers, etc. These persons fill in the blank receipts to “create” business expenses. A 
fraudster might also have a friend, spouse, relative, etc. who can provide receipts for 
“business expenses” that never really occur.  
 
EXAMPLE 
An employee’s girlfriend worked at a restaurant near the victim organization. This 
girlfriend validated credit card receipts and gave them to the fraudster so that he could 
submit them with his expense reports.  
 
In some cases a fraudster will steal an entire stack of blank receipts from a hotel, restaurant, 
etc., then fill them in and, over time, use them to verify fictitious business expenses.
