Fictitious Refunds or Voided Sales 
Fictitious refunds or voided sales can often be detected when closely examining the 
documentation submitted with the cash receipts.  
• One detection method is to evaluate the refunds or discounts given by each cashier or 
salesperson. This analysis may point out that a single employee or group of employees 
has a higher incidence of refunds or discounts than others. Further examination is then 
necessary to determine if the refunds are appropriate and properly documented. 
• Signs in the register area asking customers to ask for and examine their receipts employ 
the customer as part of the internal control system. This helps ensure that the cashier or 
salesperson is properly accounting for the sale and prevents employees from using 
customer receipts as support for false void or refunds.

• Random service calls to customers who have returned merchandise or voided sales can 
be used to verify the legitimacy of transactions.
