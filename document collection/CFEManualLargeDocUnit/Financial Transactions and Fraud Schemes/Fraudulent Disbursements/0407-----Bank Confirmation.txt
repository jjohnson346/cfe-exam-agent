Bank Confirmation  
Another method related to the cut-off statement is the bank confirmation request. Unlike 
the cut-off statement, this detection method is merely a report of the balance in the account 
as of the date requested. This balance should be requested to confirm the statement balance 
as well as any other necessary balance date. If fraud is occurring at the bank reconciliation 
stage, this independent confirmation may prove to be very helpful.
