Purchases of Services Rather than Goods   
Most shell company schemes involve the purchase of services rather than goods. The 
primary reason for this is that services are not tangible. If an employee sets up a shell 
company to make fictitious sales of goods to his employer, these goods will obviously never 
arrive. By comparing its purchases to its inventory levels, the victim organization might 
detect the fraud. It is much more difficult, on the other hand, for the victim organization to 
verify that the services were never rendered. For this reason, many employees involved in 
shell company schemes bill their employers for things like “consulting services.”
