Bogus Supporting Documents 
While some perpetrators attempt to wipe out all traces of their fraudulent disbursements by 
destroying the checks, forcing the bank reconciliation and so on, others opt to justify their 
checks by manufacturing fake support for them. These persons prepare false payment 
vouchers, including false invoices, purchase orders, and/or receiving reports to create an 
appearance of authenticity. This concealment strategy is only practical when the employee 
writes checks payable to someone other than himself (such as an accomplice or a shell 
company). A check made payable to an employee may raise suspicions regardless of any 
supporting documents that he manufactures.
