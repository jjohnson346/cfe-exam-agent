Chapter 13 — Adjustments of Debts 
Chapter 13 provides another type of bankruptcy that allows a debtor pay off his debts over 
time in accordance with a court approved plan. Under this type of case, the debtor may keep 
certain property that he would not be allowed to retain in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Because 
of changes to the bankruptcy law in 2005, many people are no longer eligible to file for 
bankruptcy under Chapter 7; some have their Chapter 7 case converted to a Chapter 13 case, 
but Chapter 13 is not granted if the debtor received a discharge under Chapters 7, 11, or 12 
within the previous 4 years, or a discharge under Chapter 13 in the previous 2 years. 
 
Also, the court many not grant a Chapter 13 discharge unless the debtor has completed an 
education course in personal financial management.
