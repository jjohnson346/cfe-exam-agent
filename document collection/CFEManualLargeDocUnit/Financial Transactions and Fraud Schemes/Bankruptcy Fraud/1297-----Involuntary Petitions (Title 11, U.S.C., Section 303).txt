Involuntary Petitions (Title 11, U.S.C., Section 303)  
Most bankruptcy cases are voluntary (i.e., voluntarily filed by the debtor). As we have 
described above, debtors have specific reasons for filing bankruptcy. Individuals,

partnerships, and corporations have the statutory right to file bankruptcy as a protection 
from their creditors. In exchange for exercising their privilege of filing bankruptcy, debtors 
give up their right to financial privacy and must do other things required under the code. 
 
Most creditors, however, do not want their de btors to file for bankruptcy because it might 
make recovering a claim more difficult, and it might diminish the amount they receive on 
their claim.  
 
To collect amounts owed to them or to obtain a judgment against the debtor, some creditors 
might sue the debtor in state court before any bankruptcy petition is filed. Numerous 
collection actions can be brought against the debtor, which might lead to an increase in 
competition for the debtor’s remaining assets. When this occurs, the debtor normally files 
bankruptcy to prevent these creditors from seizing its assets. In some rare instances, 
however, the creditors might involuntary petition the debtor into bankruptcy, although 
doing so runs contrary to their normal inclination to do everything they can to keep debtors 
out of bankruptcy. 
 
That being said, involuntary petitions serve very important purposes; they can be used to 
stop the financial hemorrhaging that usually takes place in fraudulently operated businesses, 
and they allow the creditors to control the debtor and protect the value of the business while 
investigating the financial affairs of the debtor.  
 
An involuntary petition can only be filed under Chapters 7 and 11. Creditors who have not 
been paid by the debtor can file a petition forcing the company into bankruptcy. Generally, 
the creditors must be able to demonstrate in court that the debtor is not paying debts as they 
mature. 
 
To commence the filing of an involuntary proceeding, creditors must satisfy the following 
criteria: 
• The debts must not be subject to a bona fide dispute and must be noncontingent. 
• The creditor(s) must be owed at least $14,425 more than the value of the lien or 
collateral. 
• If there are 12 or more creditors, then three creditors are needed to file. 
• If there are fewer than 12 creditors, only one creditor is needed to file.

After the involuntary petition is filed, a court hearing is held. The court might dismiss the 
petition or enter an order for relief. But if the court deems it necessary, an interim trustee 
might be appointed to preserve the property of the estate. At the hearing on the involuntary 
petition, the creditors are required to demonstrate, through direct testimony, that the alleged 
debtor is not paying debts as they come due. 
 
Creditors must be careful when filing an involuntary petition. If the creditors are not 
successful in court and the judge dismisses the petition, they might be sued by the debtor. 
Damages for lost profits and goodwill could be assessed against the creditors who filed the 
involuntary petition. Occasionally, in egregious circumstances, courts have awarded punitive 
damages against creditors who filed an involuntary petition.
