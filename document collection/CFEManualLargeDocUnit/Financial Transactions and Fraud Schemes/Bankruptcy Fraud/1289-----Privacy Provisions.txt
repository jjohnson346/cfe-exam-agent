Privacy Provisions 
Under the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, the bankruptcy 
court is permitted to honor the privacy policies of business debtors. The Act creates a 
consumer privacy ombudsman to protect personal privacy in bankruptcy proceedings. 
Measures may be implemented to prevent identity theft and to guide what information is 
readily accessible to the public. Debtors are permitted to request that courts protect sensitive 
information before it is placed in public records.
