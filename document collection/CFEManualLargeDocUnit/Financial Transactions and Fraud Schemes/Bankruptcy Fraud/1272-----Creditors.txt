Creditors 
A creditor is defined by the code as one who holds a claim. Creditors can be either secured or 
unsecured.  
 
SECURED CREDITORS  
A secured creditor  holds a claim for which there is a properly perfected security interest. It will 
be considered a secured claim to the extent of the value of the property. When the debt is 
undersecured (amount of note is greater than the value of the security interest), the debt will 
be considered both unsecured and secured. For example, if a note for $500 is secured by 
property having a value of $400, there will be a secured claim for $400 and an unsecured 
claim for $100. If the debtor and the credit or cannot agree on the value of the collateral, 
there will be a hearing under section 506 of the Bankruptcy Code and the court will 
determine the value of the collateral. The bankruptcy court will rely on state law where the 
property is located to determine if a secured claim exists. A security interest generally is 
obtained in personal property by a UCC filing and in real property by filing a lien with the 
county clerk in the county where the property is located. 
 
At the time of the filing of the bankruptcy petition, an automatic stay precludes the creditor 
from taking any action to repossess the property, unless relief from the stay is granted. In a 
Chapter 11 case, the court generally will grant relief only if it can be shown that there is no 
equity in the property and that the property is not needed for reorganizing the business. The 
stay also might be removed if the property is declining in value and the debtor fails to 
compensate the creditor for this decline (referred to as “adequate protection payments”). If

the stay is removed, the creditor then can proceed under state law to obtain possession of 
the property (often through a foreclosure) to satisfy the claim. 
 
Holders of secured claims have priority over unsecured creditors and normally get paid first 
in the distributions to creditors made by the trustee or debtor-in-possession. In the 
development of a Chapter 11 plan, the rights of holders of secured claims normally are 
provided for before the unsecured claim holders will receive material consideration.  
 
UNSECURED CREDITORS  
Unsecured creditors  are those that have a claim against the debtor that arose before the 
bankruptcy petition was filed and do not have a perfected security interest. Title 11, U.S.C., 
section 507 gives some of the holders of unsecured claims priority over other unsecured 
claim holders. Among those claims that have priority are administrative expenses (costs 
associated with the operation of the business and professional fees while the business or 
individual is in bankruptcy), selected pre-petition unpaid wages, pre-petition contributions 
required but not made to employees benefit plans, pre-petition unpaid alimony and support 
payments, and selected pre-petition tax claims.
