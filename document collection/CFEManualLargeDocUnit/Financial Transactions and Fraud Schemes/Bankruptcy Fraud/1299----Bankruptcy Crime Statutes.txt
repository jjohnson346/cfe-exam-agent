Bankruptcy Crime Statutes 
Bankruptcy crimes that are committed during the course of a bankruptcy proceeding, or in 
contemplation of a bankruptcy proceeding, are contained in federal statutes. They are carried 
out through the filing of a bankruptcy petition either to accomplish the purpose of the crime 
or to cover up another crime that has already been perpetrated.  
 
Although the Bankruptcy Code is contained within Title 11, U.S. Code, bankruptcy crimes 
appear within Title 18, U.S. Code, sections 151 through 155. Section 152 is the most 
comprehensive of the individual bankruptcy crime statutes. To constitute and be proved as a 
federal crime, bankruptcy crimes must have been committed during the pendency of a bankruptcy 
proceeding, with the defendant’s knowledge, and with a fraudulent intent to defeat the bankruptcy laws. 
The FBI investigates bankruptcy crimes and the U.S. Attorney’s office prosecutes them.  
 
Financial Transactions  Bankruptcy Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1315 
It is no defense to these crimes that the creditors have actual knowledge of concealed assets 
or that the concealment was not from all creditors, and it is no defense that the defendant 
returned the estate’s assets, though such facts might mitigate damages. 
 
Generally, the penalty for each bankruptcy offense is a fine (of up to $500,000 in the case of 
bankruptcy fraud committed by an organization) or imprisonment for not more than five 
years, or both. The statute of limitations does not run until the fraud is detected or the 
debtor receives a discharge or is denied a discharge pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code.  
 
The following sections set out the bankruptcy crime statutes as well as related criminal 
statutes that frequently arise in bankruptcy cases.  
 
Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 151 
This section contains the definition of the term debtor, a party who has filed a petition under 
Title 11 of the U.S. Code. 
 
Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 152  
This is the most comprehensive criminal bankruptcy fraud statute; it serves as the primary 
bankruptcy crime statute for prosecuting bankruptcy fraud. Under section 158, the FBI and 
the US Attorneys are charged with enforcement of section 152. There are nine paragraphs in 
section 152 that define various offenses against the bankruptcy laws. The following is a brief 
overview of each of the nine offenses.  
 
Paragraph 1 — Concealment of Property  
 
A person who knowingly and fraudulently conceals from a custodian, trustee, marshal, or other 
officer of the court charged with the control or custody of property, or, in connection with a case 
under Title 11, from creditors or  the United States Trustee, any property belonging to the estate 
of a debtor; 
 
For purposes of this paragraph, estate property consists of assets, records, and anything  
of value.  
 
Paragraph 2 — False Oath or Account  
False oaths apply to oral testimony that might be given in 341(a) examinations, 2004 
examinations (depositions), and testimony provided at hearings and trials.  
Bankruptcy Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1316                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
A person who knowingly and fraudulently makes a false oath or account in or in relation to 
any case under Title 11. 
 
Paragraph 3 — False Declarations 
 
A person who knowingly and fraudulently makes a false declaration, certificate, verification or 
statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of Title 28, in or in relation 
to any case under Title 11.  
 
Written documents filed with the court under penalty of perjury consist of the debtor’s 
petition, schedules and statements of financial affairs, interim statements and operating 
reports, as well as declarations filed with the court. Declarations are made in petitions, 
schedules and in other court filings (motions). This section gives the same weight to 
unsworn declarations as to those sworn under penalty of perjury.  
 
Paragraph 4 — False Claims 
 
A person who knowingly and fraudulently presents any false claim for proof against the estate of 
a debtor, or uses any such claim in any case under  Title 11, in a personal capacity or as or 
through an agent, proxy, or attorney. 
 
This paragraph is designed to prevent fictitious or inflated claims from being filed by 
creditors or others in a bankruptcy case. 
 
Paragraph 5 — Fraudulent Receipt of Property 
 
A person who knowingly and fraudulently receiv es any material amount of property from a 
debtor after the filing of a case under Title 11 with intent to defeat the provisions of Title 11 
 
This paragraph relates back to paragraph 1, above, and it implicates those who work in 
concert with the debtor. This could be a creditor or any other interested party. 
 
  
Financial Transactions  Bankruptcy Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1317 
Paragraph 6 — Extortion and Bribery 
 
A person who knowingly and fraudulently gives, offers, receives or attempts to obtain any 
money or property, remuneration, compensation, reward, advantage, or promise thereof, for 
acting or forbearing to act in any case under Title 11. 
  
This paragraph covers bribery, which also is spelled out in Title 18, principally sections 210 
and 1503. Both Sections discuss the attempt to bribe judicial officers and to unlawfully 
corrupt or influence any officer of the court. Section 1503 also covers threats intended to 
influence, intimidate, or impede an officer in the performance of his duties. 
 
Paragraph 7 — Fraudulent Transfer or Concealment 
 
A person who in a personal capacity or as agent or officer of any person or corporation, in 
contemplation of a case under Title 11 by or against him or any other person or corporation, 
or with intent to defeat the provisions of Title 11, knowingly and fraudulently transfers or 
conceals any of his property or the property of such other person or corporation.  
 
This paragraph is the only paragraph under section 152 that deals with pre-bankruptcy 
conduct. The section addresses situations where a bankruptcy petition filing is imminent. It 
is intended to cover actions by individuals who transfer property rightfully belonging to the 
creditors of the prospective bankruptcy estate. 
 
Paragraph 8 — Fraudulent Destruction or Alteration of Documents 
 
A person who, after the filing of a case under Title 11 or in contemplation thereof, knowingly 
and fraudulently conceals, destroys, mutilates, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any recorded 
information (including books, documents, records, and papers) relating to the property or 
financial affairs of a debtor. 
 
Paragraph 9 — Fraudulent Withholding of Documents 
 
A person who, after the filing of a case under Title 11, knowingly and fraudulently withholds 
from a custodian, trustee, marshal, or other officer of the court or a United States Trustee 
entitled to its possession, any recorded information (including books, documents, records, and 
papers) relating to the property or financial affairs of a debtor. 
Bankruptcy Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1318                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
This section is particularly useful in cases where the debtor does not turn over estate records 
after being compelled to do so by the court, and the records are later discovered by federal 
authorities during the execution of search warrants. 
 
Embezzlement Against the Estate, Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 153 
  
 (a) Offense. A person described in subsection (b) who knowingly and fraudulently appropriates to the 
person’s own use, embezzles, spends, or transfers any property or secretes or destroys any document 
belonging to the estate of a debtor. 
 
 (b) Person to Whom Section Applies. A person described in this subsection is one who has access to 
property or documents belonging to an estate by virtue of the person’s participation in the administration 
of the estate as a trustee, custodian, marshal, attorney, or other officer of the court or as an agent, 
employee, or other person engaged by such an officer to perform a service with respect to the estate.  
  
This statute deals with all property and the records or documents that the court officer 
receives during the tenure of the trustee or officer.  
 
Adverse Interest and Conduct of Officers, Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 154 
 
A person who, being a custodian, trustee,  marshal, or other officer of the court — 
(1)  knowingly purc hases, directly or indirectly, any property of the estate of which the person is such 
an officer in a case under Title 11;  
 
(2)  knowingly refuses to permit a reasonable opportunity for the inspection by parties in interest of 
the documents and accounts relating to the affairs of estates in the person’s charge by parties 
when directed by the court to do so; or  
(3)  knowingly refuses to permit a reasonable opport unity for the inspection by the United States 
Trustee of the documents and accounts relating to the affairs of any estate in the person’s  
charge. 
 
Bankruptcy trustees are in a position of trust and, therefore, should be held to a higher 
standard of conduct than other interested parties. But one critical aspect is the sale of estate 
property. Trustees can influence the sale of property and can make significant profits if they 
directly or indirectly purchase assets of the estate. It would be similar to insider trading by 
individuals in the securities industry. This statute is unlike the others listed above in that a 
Financial Transactions  Bankruptcy Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1319 
violation of this statute is only a misdemeanor, whereas all of the above are felonies. 
Conviction under this Section carries a fine, as well as forfeiture of the person’s office. 
 
Knowing Disregard of Bankruptcy Law or Rule, Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 156 
 
(a)  Definitions. In this section — 
(1) the term “bankruptcy petition preparer” means a person, other than the debtor’s attorney or an 
employee of such an attorney, who prepares for compensation a document for filing, and 
 
(2) the term “document for filing” means a petition or any other document prepared for filing by a 
debtor in a United States bankruptcy court or a United States district court in connection with a case 
under Title 11. 
 
(b) Offense. If a bankruptcy case or related proceeding is dismissed because of a knowing attempt by a 
bankruptcy petition preparer in any manner to disregard the requirements of Title 11, United States 
Code, or the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. 
 
This section is the criminal version of the Title 11, U.S.C., section 110, which deals with 
“petition mills” and petition preparers who de liberately disregard the Bankruptcy Code or 
any of its rules and procedures. Petition mills and preparers who fall under this section might 
file false documents for debtors with deliberately wrong Social Security numbers or other 
incorrect information. In some cases, debtors might not even be aware they are filing 
bankruptcy or the effect of a bankruptcy on their credit rating. 
 
Bankruptcy Fraud, Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 157  
 
A perso n who, having devised or in tending to devise a scheme or artifice to defraud and for the purpose 
of executing or concealing such a scheme or artifice or attempting to do so — 
 
(1) files a petition under Title 11, including a fraudulent involuntary bankruptcy petition under 
section 303 of such title;  
 
(2) files a document in a proceeding under Title 11, including a fraudulent  involuntary bankruptcy 
petition under section 303 of such title; or  
 
Bankruptcy Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1320                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
(3) makes a false or fraudulent re presentation, claim, or promise concerning or in relation to a 
proceeding under Title 11, including a fraudulent in voluntary bankruptcy petition under section 303 of 
such title, at any time before or after the filing of  the petition, or in relation to a proceeding falsely 
asserted to be pending under such Title. 
 
This section is very similar to mail and wire fraud statutes both in wording and in concept. 
This section applies to insiders who perpetrate bustout schemes, as well as those who 
attempt to obtain credit immediately prior to filing bankruptcy. Under section 158, the FBI 
and the U.S. Attorneys are charged with enforcement of section 157. 
 
Falsifying, Altering, or Destroying Documents, Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1519 
 
Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in 
any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the 
investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency 
of the United States or any case filed under Title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such 
matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. 
 
This section was added as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002. It specifically provides 
that altering, falsifying, or destroying documents filed under Title 11 (the Bankruptcy Code) 
is a criminal violation subject to imprisonment of up to 20 years. 
 
Bankruptcy-Related Violations  
Although bankruptcy crimes are the focus of this section, there are other crimes that are 
usually perpetrated prior to the filing of a bankruptcy petition. In some cases, the bankruptcy 
process is the culmination of a pattern of prior criminal activity. There are many other crimes 
frequently associated with bankruptcy including mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, interstate 
transportation of stolen goods or property, aiding or abetting, false statements, conspiracy, tax 
evasion, and money laundering. Bankruptcy fraud is also a predicate offense under RICO. For 
more information on these offenses, see the “Law Related to Fraud” chapter in the Law 
section of the Fraud Examiners Manual. 
 
Although the criminal aspects of bankruptcy crimes are heard in District Court, the 
underlying facts dealing with a debtor’s misc onduct also are heard in the form of civil 
proceedings before the United States Bankruptcy Court. Parallel proceedings occur in cases 
where bankruptcy fraud allegations have been made. Several examples of civil proceedings 
Financial Transactions  Bankruptcy Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1321 
that ensue as a result of fraud allegations against the debtor are motions for the appointment 
of trustees and examiners, lawsuits for recovery of fraudulently transferred property, and 
objections to the debtor’s discharge.
