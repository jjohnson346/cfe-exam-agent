The Bankruptcy Case 
A bankruptcy case begins with the filing of a bankruptcy petition, but to be eligible to file a 
bankruptcy petition, an individual debtor must have received credit counseling from an 
approved counseling agency within 180 days before filing. 
 
When a petition is filed, the debtor must file the following documents:  
• A list of creditors 
• A schedule of assets and liabilities 
• A schedule of current income and current expenditures 
• A statement of the debtor’s financial affairs 
• Evidence of payment from employers, if any, received 60 days before the filing date 
• An itemized statement of monthly net income 
• A statement disclosing any reasonably anticipated increase in income or expenditures for 
the 12 months after the filing 
• A record of any interest in an qualified state tuition program or an education individual 
retirement account 
• A certificate of credit counseling from the approved counseling agency (if the petitioner 
is an individual) 
• A statement of the debtor’s intention with respect to his property that secured debt (if 
the petitioner is an individual) 
• A copy of the debtor’s tax return for the most recent tax year 
 
Generally, if an individual debtor in a Chapter 7 case fails to file the documents within 45 
days of the original filing date, the case is automatically dismissed. 
 
Once the bankruptcy case has been commenced, the debtor is protected by an automatic 
stay, which prevents creditors from continuing attempts to collect debts from the petitioner. 
There are, however, exceptions where the automatic stay does not apply (e.g., prosecution of 
criminal cases, paternity cases, domestic support obligation cases, child custody cases, etc.). 
Also, if the bankruptcy petition was filed as part of a scheme to delay, hinder, or defraud 
creditors, a creditor whose claim is securted by a real property interest is entitled to relief 
from the stay.  
 
Additionally, after filing, the debtor will be appointed a trustee who will oversee the case. In 
a Chapter 7 case, the trustee is responsible for collecting, selling, and reduceing the estate’s 
assets to cash; temporarily continuing to operate the debtor’s business; making a final report;

and filing a final account. In a Chapter 11 case, however, the debtor remains in possession of 
his assets and generally retains the same authority as the trustee, except for the duty to 
investigate the debtor and the right to compensation. A trustee is appointed in a Chapter 13 
case, but the trustee’s duties generally involve in vestigating the debtor’s financial affairs.
