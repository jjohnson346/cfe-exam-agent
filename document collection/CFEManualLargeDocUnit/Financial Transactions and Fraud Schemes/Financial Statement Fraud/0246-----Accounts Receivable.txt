Accounts Receivable  
Accounts receivable are subject to manipulation in the same manner as sales and inventory, 
and in many cases, the schemes are conducted together. The two most common schemes 
involving accounts receivable are fictitious receivables and failure to write off accounts 
receivable as bad debts (or failure to establish an adequate allowance for bad debts). 
Fictitious receivables commonly arise from fictitious revenues, which were discussed earlier. 
Accounts receivable should be reported at net realizable value, that is, the amount of the 
receivable less the amount expected not to be collected.

FICTITIOUS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  
Fictitious accounts receivable are common among companies with financial problems, as 
well as with managers who receive a commission based on sales. The typical entry under 
fictitious accounts receivable is to debit (increase) accounts receivable and credit (increase) 
sales. Of course, these schemes are more common around the end of the accounting period, 
since accounts receivable are expected to be paid in cash within a reasonable time. 
Fraudsters commonly attempt to conceal fictitious accounts receivable by providing false 
confirmations of balances to auditors. They get the audit confirmations because the mailing 
address they provide for the phony customers is typically either a mailbox under their 
control, a home address, or the business address of a coconspirator. Such schemes can be 
detected by using business credit reports, public records, or even the telephone book, to 
identify significant customers with no physical existence or no apparent business need for 
the product sold to them. 
 
FAILURE TO WRITE DOWN 
Companies are required to accrue losses on uncollectible receivables when the criteria in 
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, are met. 
Companies struggling for profits and income may be tempted to omit the recognition of 
such losses because of their negative impact on income.
