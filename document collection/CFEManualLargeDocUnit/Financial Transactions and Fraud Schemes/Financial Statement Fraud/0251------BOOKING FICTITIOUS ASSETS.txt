BOOKING FICTITIOUS ASSETS 
One of the easiest methods of asset misrepresentation is the recording of fictitious assets. 
This false creation of assets affects account totals on a company’s balance sheet. The 
corresponding account commonly used is the owners’ equity account. Because company 
assets are often physically found in many different locations, this fraud can sometimes be 
easily overlooked. One of the most common fictitious asset schemes is to simply create 
fictitious documents. In other instances, the equipment is leased, not owned, and this fact is 
not disclosed during the audit of fixed assets. Bogus fixed assets can sometimes be detected 
because the fixed asset addition makes no business sense.
