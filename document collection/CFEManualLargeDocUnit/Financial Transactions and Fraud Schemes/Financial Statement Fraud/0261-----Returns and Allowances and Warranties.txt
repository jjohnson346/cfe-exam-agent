Returns and Allowances and Warranties   
Improper recording of sales returns and allowances occurs when a company fails to properly 
record or present the expense associated with sales returns and customer allowances 
stemming from customer dissatisfaction. It is inevitable that a certain percentage of products 
sold will, for one reason or another, be returned. When this happens, management must 
record the related expense as a contra-sales account, which reduces the amount of net sales 
presented on the company’s income statement.  
 
Likewise, when a company offers a warranty on product sales, it must estimate the amount 
of warranty expense it reasonably expects to incur over the warranty period and accrue a 
liability for that amount. In warranty liability fraud, the warranty liability is usually either 
omitted altogether or substantially understated. Another similar area is the liability resulting 
from defective products (product liability).
