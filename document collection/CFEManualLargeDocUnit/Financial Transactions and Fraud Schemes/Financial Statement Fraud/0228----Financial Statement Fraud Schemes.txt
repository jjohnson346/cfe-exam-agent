Financial Statement Fraud

Financial Statement Fraud Schemes 
Fraud in financial statements typically takes the form of: 
• Overstated assets or revenue 
• Understated liabilities and expenses 
 
Overstating assets and revenues falsely reflects a financially stronger company by inclusion 
of fictitious asset costs or artificial revenues. Understated liabilities and expenses are shown 
through exclusion of costs or financial obligations. Both methods result in increased equity 
and net worth for the company. This manipulation results in increased earnings per share or 
partnership profit interests, or a more stable picture of the company’s true situation.  
 
However, in government contracts, just the opposite may be true: 
• Assets and revenues are understated. 
• Liabilities and expenses are overstated. 
 
Why? As explained by government auditors, entities may rely on understated revenues or 
overstated expenses to get more money for a project or contract. However, such schemes 
are by far the minority of financial statement fraud cases. 
 
To demonstrate the over- and understatements typically used to fraudulently enhance the 
financial statements, the schemes have been divided into five classes. Because the maintenance 
of financial records involves a double-entry system, fraudulent accounting entries always affect 
at least two accounts and, therefore, at least two categories on the financial statements. While 
the areas described below reflect their financial statement classifications, keep in mind that the 
other side of the fraudulent transaction exists elsewhere. It is common for schemes to involve 
a combination of several methods. The five classifications of financial statement schemes are: 
• Fictitious revenues 
• Timing differences  
• Improper asset valuations 
• Concealed liabilities and expenses 
• Improper disclosures

Fictitious Revenues  
Fictitious or fabricated revenues involve the recording of sales of goods or services that did 
not occur. Fictitious sales most often involve fake or phantom customers, but can also 
involve legitimate customers. For example, a fictitious invoice can be prepared (but not 
mailed) for a legitimate customer although the goods are not delivered or the services are not 
rendered. At the beginning of the next accounting period, the sale might be reversed to help 
conceal the fraud, but this may lead to a revenue shortfall in the new period, creating the 
need for more fictitious sales. Another method is to use legitimate customers and artificially 
inflate or alter invoices reflecting higher amounts or quantities than are actually sold.  
 
Generally speaking, revenue is recognized when it is (1) realized or realizable, and (2) earned. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 
Topic 13, Revenue Recognition (now codified in FASB ASC 605-10-S99), to provide additional 
guidance on revenue recognition criteria and to rein in some of the inappropriate practices 
that had been observed. FASB ASC 605-10-S99 states that revenue is typically considered 
realized or realizable, and earned when all of the following criteria are met: 
• Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 
• Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 
• The seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and 
• Collectibility is reasonably assured. 
 
EXAMPLE OF FICTITIOUS REVENUES 
In one case, a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. company recorded several large fictitious sales to 
a series of companies. They invoiced the sa les but did not collect any of the accounts 
receivable, which became severely past due. The manager of the foreign subsidiary arranged 
for false confirmations of  the accounts receivable for audit purposes and even hired actors to 
pretend to be the customers during a visit fr om U.S. management. Background checks on 
the customers would have revealed that some of the companies were fictitious while others 
either were undisclosed related parties or operated in industries that would have no need for 
the goods supposedly supplied. An investigation  revealed that the manager of the foreign 
subsidiary directed the scheme to record fictitious revenues in order to meet unrealistic 
revenue goals set by U.S. management.  
 
In some cases, companies go to great lengths to conceal fictitious sales. A sample journal 
entry from such a case is detailed below. A fictional entry is made to record a purported 
Financial Transactions  Financial Statement Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.311 
purchase of fixed assets. This entry debits fixed assets for the amount of the alleged 
purchase and the credit is to cash for the payment: 
 
Date Description Ref. Debit Credit 
12/01/X1 Fixed Assets 104 350,000  
 Cash 101  350,000 
 
A fictitious sales entry is then made for the same amount as the false purchase, debiting 
accounts receivable and crediting the sales account. The cash outflow that supposedly paid 
for the fixed assets is “returned” as payment on the receivable account, though in practice 
the cash might never have moved if the fraudsters didn’t bother to falsify that extra 
documentary support. 
 
Date Description Ref. Debit Credit 
12/01/X1 Accounts Rec 120 350,000  
 Sales 400  350,000 
12/15/X1 Cash 101 350,000  
 Accounts Rec 120  350,000 
 
The result of this completely fabricated sequence of events is an increase in both fixed assets 
and revenue. The debit could alternatively have been directed to other accounts, such as 
inventory or accounts payable, or simply left in accounts receivable if the fraud were 
committed close to the year’s end and the receivable could be left outstanding without 
attracting undue attention. 
 
Sales with Conditions  
Sales with conditions are those that have terms that have not been completed and the rights 
and risks of ownership have not passed to the purchaser. They do not qualify for recording 
as revenue. These types of sales are similar to schemes involving the recognition of revenue 
in improper periods, since the conditions for sale may become satisfied in the future, at 
which point revenue recognition would become appropriate. The recognition of revenue in 
improper periods is discussed further in the next section.  
 
What Red Flags Are Associated with Fictitious Revenues? 
The following red flags are associated with fictitious revenues:  
• Rapid growth or unusual profitability, especially compared to that of other companies in 
the same industry.  
Financial Statement Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.312                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• Recurring negative cash flows from operations or an inability to generate positive cash 
flows from operations while reporting earnings and earnings growth.  
• Significant transactions with related parties or special purpose entities not in the ordinary 
course of business or where those entities are not audited or are audited by a separate 
firm.  
• Significant, unusual, or highly complex transactions, especially those close to the period’s 
end that pose difficult “substance over form” questions. 
• Unusual growth in the days’ sales in receivables ratio (receivables/average daily sales). 
• A significant volume of sales to entities whose substance and ownership is not known. 
• An unusual surge in sales by a minority of units within a company, or in sales recorded 
by corporate headquarters. 
 
Timing Differences (Including Premature Revenue Recognition)  
Financial statement fraud might also involve timing differences, that is, the recording of 
revenues or expenses in improper periods. This can be done to shift revenues or expenses 
between one period and the next, increasing or decreasing earnings as desired. 
 
Premature Revenue Recognition 
As previously mentioned, revenue should be recognized in the accounting records when the 
following four criteria as set out in FASB ASC 605-10-S99 have been satisfied: 
• Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 
• Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 
• The seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and 
• Collectibility is reasonably assured. 
 
One or more of these criteria is typically  not met when managers recognize revenues 
prematurely. Examples of common problems with premature revenue recognition are set 
out below. 
 
PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT DOES NOT EXIST 
• No written or verbal agreement exists. 
• A verbal agreement exists but a written agreement is customary. 
• A written order exists but is conditional upon sale to end users (such as a consignment 
sale). 
• A written order exists but contains a right of return. 
• A written order exists but a side letter alters the terms in ways that eliminate the required 
Financial Transactions  Financial Statement Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.313 
elements for an agreement. 
• The transaction is with a related party, which has not been disclosed. 
 
DELIVERY HAS NOT OCCURRED OR SERVICES HAVE NOT BEEN RENDERED 
• Shipment has not been made and the criteria for recognizing revenue on “bill-and-hold” 
transactions set out in FASB ASC 605-10-S99 have not been met. 
• Shipment has been made not to the customer but to the seller’s agent, an installer, or to a 
public warehouse. 
• Some, but not all, of the components required for operation were shipped. 
• Items of the wrong specification were shipped. 
• Delivery is not complete until installation, customer testing, and customer acceptance 
has occurred. 
• Services have not been provided at all. 
• Services are being performed over an extended period and only a portion of the service 
revenues should have been recognized in the current period. 
• The mix of goods and services in a contract has been misstated in order to improperly 
accelerate revenue recognition. 
 
THE SELLER’S PRICE TO THE BUYER IS NOT FIXED OR DETERMINABLE 
• The price is contingent upon some future events. 
• A service or membership fee is subject to unpredictable cancellation during the contract 
period. 
• The transaction includes an option to exchange the product for others. 
• Payment terms are extended for a substantial period and additional discounts or 
upgrades may be required to induce continued use and payment instead of switching to 
alternative products. 
 
COLLECTIBILITY IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED 
• Collection is contingent upon a future event, such as resale of the product, receipt of 
additional funding, or litigation. 
• The customer does not have the ability to pay; for example, it is financially troubled, it 
has purchased far more than it can afford, or it is a shell company with minimal assets. 
 
EXAMPLE 
ABC, Inc. sells products that require engineering and adapting work before they are 
acceptable to customers. However, the company records sales revenue before completing the 
Financial Statement Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.314                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
engineering, testing, evaluation, and customer acceptance stages of production. In some cases, 
sales do not take place for weeks or months.  In other cases, the sales are specifically 
contingent upon the customer’s trial and acceptance of the product.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Another company is engaged in the design, development, manufacture, marketing, and 
servicing of computer peripheral subsystems. The company recognized revenue prior to a time 
when collection of the sales price was reasonably assured and at  a time prior to completion 
of the underlying sales transaction. 
 
It was the company’s policy to recognize revenue  when the products we re shipped. However, 
the sales were not complete as of the time of shipment because customers were not obligated 
to pay for the equipment until it had been installed; the company had substantial 
obligations to the customers for installation  and adjustments; and there remained major 
uncertainties concerning the customers’ true willingness to complete the transaction because 
of the volatile nature of the high-tech product. 
 
Long-Term Contracts 
Long-term contracts pose special problems for revenue recognition. Long-term construction 
contracts, for example, use either the completed-contract method or the percentage-of-completion 
method, depending partly on the circumstances. The completed-contract 
method does not record revenue until the project is 100 percent complete. Construction 
costs are held in an inventory account until completion of the project. The percentage-of-completion 
method recognizes revenues and expenses as measurable progress on a project is 
made, but this method is particularly vulnerable to manipulation. Managers can often easily 
manipulate the percentage-of-completion and the estimated costs to complete a construction 
project in order to recognize revenues prematurely and conceal contract overruns.  
 
Multiple Deliverables 
Product and service sales sometimes involve multiple deliverables (or multiple-element 
arrangements). For example, a cell phone company provides a discounted or free cell phone 
to a customer who signs up for a two-year service agreement; in this situation, the 
deliverables include both the product (cell phone) and the service, which spans two years. In 
multiple-element arrangements, the seller completes the earnings process—and thus must 
recognize revenue—over a period of time.  
 
Financial Transactions  Financial Statement Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.315 
Under FASB ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition—Multiple-Element Arrangements, companies are 
required to estimate the price of the individual components in a multiple-element sale. 
Companies must then recognize the revenue related to each of the components as they are 
delivered. The inherent inexact nature of the estimates involved in this process leaves this 
revenue recognition method vulnerable to fraud as managers can manipulate the estimated 
price of the individual components in order to delay or accelerate revenue recognition. 
 
Channel-Stuffing 
A challenging area of revenue recognition that has attracted the attention of the SEC is 
known as “channel-stuffing.” Channel-stuffing refers to the sale of an unusually large 
quantity of a product to distributors who are encouraged to overbuy through the use of deep 
discounts or extended payment terms. This practice is especially attractive to industries with 
high gross margins, such as tobacco, pharmaceuticals, perfume, soda concentrate, and 
branded consumer goods, because it can increase short-term earnings. On the downside, 
however, stealing from future periods’ sales makes it harder to achieve sales goals in those 
future periods. The pressure to meet sales goals can, in turn, lead to increasingly disruptive 
levels of channel-stuffing and, ultimately, to a restatement. Although orders are received, the 
terms of the order might raise questions about the collectibility of the accounts receivable, 
and any existing side agreements that grant a right of return may, effectively, turn the sales 
into consignment sales. Also, there might be a greater risk of returns for certain products if 
they cannot be sold before their shelf life ends.  
 
In recent years, the SEC has brought enforcement actions or charges related to channel-stuffing 
against a number of major U.S. corporations, including McAfee, Inc. and The Coca-Cola 
Company. In 2006, the SEC released a press release stating that McAfee agreed to settle 
the proceedings and pay a $50 million penalty after being charged by the SEC with 
accounting fraud (http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2006-3.htm). According to the press 
release, the accounting fraud charges included allegations that “McAfee used a variety of 
undisclosed ploys during [the years 1998 throug h 2000] to aggressively oversell its products 
to distributors in amounts that far exceeded the public’s demand for the products.” The 
SEC alleged that, as part of this channel-stuffing scheme, McAfee: 
• Improperly recorded the sales to distributors as revenue; 
• Offered its distributors lucrative sales incentives, including deep price discounts and 
rebates, in an effort to persuade the distributors to continue to buy and stockpile 
McAfee products; 
• Secretly paid distributors millions of dollars to hold the excess inventory rather than 
Financial Statement Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.316                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
return it to McAfee for a refund and consequent reduction in McAfee’s revenues; 
• Used an undisclosed, wholly-owned subsidiary, Net Tools, Inc. to repurchase inventory 
that McAfee had oversold to its distributors; and, 
• Took action to conceal the fraud from investors by, among other things, wrongly 
recording in its books the payments and discounts that it offered to distributors, and 
improperly manipulating reserve accounts to increase inadequate sales reserves and cover 
the costs of the distributor payments. 
 
In 2005, the SEC issued a press release announcing an enforcement action against The 
Coca-Cola Company relating to its channel-stuffing practice in Japan known as “gallon 
pushing” ( http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2005-58.htm). According to the press release, 
the SEC found that, from 1997 through 1999, Coca-Cola failed to disclose certain end-of-
 quarter sales practices used to meet earnings expectations. Specifically, Coca-Cola was 
alleged by the SEC to have offered extended credit to Japanese bottlers to induce them to 
purchase quantities of beverage concentrate the bottlers otherwise would not have 
purchased until a following period. Although Coca-Cola’s accounting treatment for sales 
made in connection with gallon pushing was found to be without issue, the SEC did find 
that Coca-Cola’s failure to disclose the impact of gallon pushing on current and future 
earnings, as well as related false statements and omissions within a pertinent Form 8-K, 
violated the antifraud and periodic reporting requirements of the federal securities laws.  
 
Recording Expenses in the Wrong Period 
The timely recording of expenses is often compromised due to pressures to meet budget 
projections and goals, or due to lack of proper accounting controls. As the expensing of 
certain costs is pushed into periods other than the ones in which they actually occur, they are 
not properly matched against the income that they help produce. For example, revenue may 
be recognized on the sale of certain items, but the cost of goods and services that went into 
the items sold might intentionally not be recorded in the accounting system until the 
subsequent period. This might make the sales revenue from the transaction almost pure 
profit, inflating earnings. In the next period, earnings would be depressed by a similar 
amount. 
 
What Red Flags Are Associated with Timing Differences (Including Premature Revenue Recognition)? 
• Rapid growth or unusual profitability, especially compared to that of other companies in 
the same industry.  
Financial Transactions  Financial Statement Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.317 
• Recurring negative cash flows from operations or an inability to generate positive cash 
flows from operations while reporting earnings and earnings growth.  
• Significant, unusual, or highly complex transactions, especially those close to the period’s 
end that pose difficult “substance over form” questions. 
• Unusual increase in gross margin or gross margin in excess of industry peers. 
• Unusual growth in the days’ sales in receivables ratio (receivables/average daily sales). 
• Unusual decline in the days’ purchases in accounts payable ratio (accounts 
payable/average daily purchases). 
 
Improper Asset Valuation 
Under the “lower of cost or market value” ru le, where an asset’s  cost exceeds its current 
market value (as happens often with obsolete technology), the asset must be written down to 
market value. With the exception of certain securities, asset values are generally not increased 
to reflect current market value. It is often necessary to use estimates in accounting. For 
example, estimates are used in determining the residual value and the useful life of a 
depreciable asset, the uncollectible portion of accounts receivable, or the excess or obsolete 
portion of inventory. Whenever estimates are used, there is an additional opportunity for 
fraud by manipulating those estimates.  
 
Many schemes are used to inflate current assets  at the expense of long-term assets. The net 
effect is seen in the current ratio. The misclassification of long-term assets as current assets 
can be of critical concern to lending institutions that often require the maintenance of 
certain financial ratios. This is of particular consequence when the loan covenants are on 
unsecured or under-secured lines of credit and other short-term borrowings. Sometimes 
these misclassifications are referred to as “window dressing.” 
 
Most improper asset valuations involve the fraudulent overstatement of inventory or 
receivables. Other improper asset valuations include manipulation of the allocation of the 
purchase price of an acquired business in order to inflate future earnings, misclassification of 
fixed and other assets, or improper capitalization of inventory or start-up costs.  
 
Improper asset valuations usually take the form of one of the following classifications:  
• Inventory valuation 
• Accounts receivable 
• Business combinations 
• Fixed assets 
Financial Statement Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.318                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Inventory Valuation 
Inventory should be recorded at the lower of cost or market value. This means that 
inventory must be valued at its acquisition cost, except when the cost is determined to be 
higher than the current market value, in which case it should be written down to its current 
value, or written off altogether if it has no value. Failing to write down inventory results in 
overstated assets and the mismatching of cost of goods sold with revenues. Other methods 
by which inventory can be improperly stated include manipulation of the physical inventory 
count, inflation of the unit costs used to price out inventory, and failure to relieve inventory 
for the costs of goods sold. Fictitious inventory schemes usually involve the creation of fake 
documents, such as inventory count sheets and receiving reports. Companies have even 
programmed special computer reports of inventory for auditors that incorrectly added up 
the line item values so as to inflate the overall inventory balance. Computer-assisted audit 
techniques can significantly help auditors to detect many of these inventory fraud 
techniques. 
 
In some instances, friendly coconspirators claim to be holding inventory for companies in 
question. Other times, companies falsely report large values of inventory in transit (perhaps 
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean), knowing that the auditors will have a difficult time 
observing it. “Bill and hold” items that have already been recorded as sales might be 
included in the physical inventory count, as might goods owned by third parties but held by 
companies on consignment or for storage. Companies have even made up pallets of 
inventory with hollow centers, placed bricks in sealed boxes instead of high value products, 
and shuttled inventory overnight between locations being observed by auditors on different 
days so as to double count the inventory. Finally, it is also common for companies to insert 
phony count sheets during the inventory observation or change the quantities on the  
count sheets. 
 
Accounts Receivable  
Accounts receivable are subject to manipulation in the same manner as sales and inventory, 
and in many cases, the schemes are conducted together. The two most common schemes 
involving accounts receivable are fictitious receivables and failure to write off accounts 
receivable as bad debts (or failure to establish an adequate allowance for bad debts). 
Fictitious receivables commonly arise from fictitious revenues, which were discussed earlier. 
Accounts receivable should be reported at net realizable value, that is, the amount of the 
receivable less the amount expected not to be collected.  
 
Financial Transactions  Financial Statement Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.319 
FICTITIOUS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  
Fictitious accounts receivable are common among companies with financial problems, as 
well as with managers who receive a commission based on sales. The typical entry under 
fictitious accounts receivable is to debit (increase) accounts receivable and credit (increase) 
sales. Of course, these schemes are more common around the end of the accounting period, 
since accounts receivable are expected to be paid in cash within a reasonable time. 
Fraudsters commonly attempt to conceal fictitious accounts receivable by providing false 
confirmations of balances to auditors. They get the audit confirmations because the mailing 
address they provide for the phony customers is typically either a mailbox under their 
control, a home address, or the business address of a coconspirator. Such schemes can be 
detected by using business credit reports, public records, or even the telephone book, to 
identify significant customers with no physical existence or no apparent business need for 
the product sold to them. 
 
FAILURE TO WRITE DOWN 
Companies are required to accrue losses on uncollectible receivables when the criteria in 
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, are met. 
Companies struggling for profits and income may be tempted to omit the recognition of 
such losses because of their negative impact on income.  
 
Business Combinations 
Companies are required to allocate the purchase price they have paid to acquire another 
business to the tangible and intangible assets of that business. Any excess of the purchase 
price over the value of the acquired assets is treated as goodwill. Current standards 
governing goodwill accounting have decreased the incentive for companies to minimize the 
amount allocated to goodwill that previously was required to be amortized against future 
earnings. However, companies may still be tempted to over-allocate the purchase price to in-
 process research and development assets, in order to then write them off immediately. Or 
they may establish excessive reserves for various expenses at the time of acquisition, 
intending to quietly release those excess reserves into earnings at a future date.  
 
Fixed Assets  
Bogus fixed assets can be created by a variety of methods. They are subject to manipulation 
through several different schemes. Some of the more common schemes are booking 
fictitious assets, misrepresenting asset valuation, and capitalizing non-asset costs. 
 
Financial Statement Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.320                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
BOOKING FICTITIOUS ASSETS 
One of the easiest methods of asset misrepresentation is the recording of fictitious assets. 
This false creation of assets affects account totals on a company’s balance sheet. The 
corresponding account commonly used is the owners’ equity account. Because company 
assets are often physically found in many different locations, this fraud can sometimes be 
easily overlooked. One of the most common fictitious asset schemes is to simply create 
fictitious documents. In other instances, the equipment is leased, not owned, and this fact is 
not disclosed during the audit of fixed assets. Bogus fixed assets can sometimes be detected 
because the fixed asset addition makes no business sense. 
 
MISREPRESENTING THE VALUE OF FIXED ASSETS 
Fixed assets should be recorded at cost. Although assets may appreciate in value, this 
increase in value should not be recognized on company financial statements. Many financial 
statement frauds have involved the reporting of fixed assets at market values instead of the 
lower acquisition costs, or at even higher inflated values with phony valuations to support 
them. Further, companies may falsely inflate the value of fixed assets by failing to record 
impairments of long-lived assets (as required by FASB ASC 350-30-35) and of goodwill (as 
required by FASB ASC 350-20-35). Misrepresentat ion of asset values frequently goes hand 
in hand with other schemes.  
 
EXAMPLE 
In October 2002, the SEC filed a civil enforcement action against former Enron CFO 
Andrew S. Fastow, who also faced criminal charges, relating to an alleged self-enriching 
scheme to defraud Enron’s security holders through the use of  certain off-balance-sheet 
entities. One of the six transactions in the SEC’s complaint against Andrew Fastow 
involved Raptor I and Avici. According to the complaint, Enron and the Fastow-
 controlled partnership LJM2 engaged in complex transactions with an entity called Raptor 
I. Raptor I was used to manipulate Enron’s balance sheet and income statement and to 
generate profits for LJM2 and Fastow at Enron’s expense. In September 2000, Fastow 
and others used Raptor I to effectuate a fraudulent hedging transact ion and thus avoid a 
decrease in the value of Enron’s investment in  the stock of a public company called Avici 
Systems Inc. Specifically, Fastow and others back-dated documents to make it appear that 
Enron had locked in the value of its investment in Avici in August of 2000, when Avici’s 
stock was trading at its all time high price. 
 
Financial Transactions  Financial Statement Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.321 
CAPITALIZING NON-ASSET COSTS 
Excluded from the cost of a purchased asset are interest and finance charges incurred in the 
purchase. For example, when a company finances a capital equipment purchase, monthly 
payments include both principal liability reduction and interest payments. On initial 
purchase, only the original cost of the asset should be capitalized. The subsequent interest 
payments should be charged to interest expense and not to the asset. Without a reason for 
intensive review, fraud of this type can go unchecked.  
 
Understating Assets 
In some cases, as with some government-related or -regulated companies, it is advantageous 
to understate assets. Additional funding is often based on asset amounts. This 
understatement can be done directly or through improper depreciation. 
 
Misclassifying Assets 
In order to meet budget requirements, and for various other reasons, assets are sometimes 
misclassified into general ledger accounts in which they don’t belong. For example, fixed 
assets may be fraudulently reclassified as current assets. The manipulation can skew financial 
ratios and help the company comply with loan covenants or other borrowing requirements.  
 
What Red Flags Are Associated with Improper Asset Valuation? 
• Recurring negative cash flows from operations or an inability to generate positive cash 
flows from operations while reporting earnings and earnings growth. 
• Significant declines in customer demand and increasing business failures in either the 
industry or the overall economy. 
• Assets, liabilities, revenues, or expenses based on significant estimates that involve 
subjective judgments or uncertainties that are difficult to support. 
• Non-financial management’s excessive part icipation in or preoccupation with the 
selection of accounting principles or the determination of significant estimates.  
• Unusual increase in gross margin or margin in excess of industry peers. 
• Unusual growth in the number of days’ sales in receivables ratio. 
• Unusual growth in the number of days’ purchases in inventory ratio. 
• Reduction in allowances for bad debts, excess inventory, obsolete inventory, etc., 
especially if relevant ratios are out of line with those of industry peers. 
• Unusual change in the relationship between fixed assets and depreciation. 
• Adding to assets while competitors are reducing capital tied up in assets.

Concealed Liabilities and Expenses 
Understating liabilities and expenses is one of the ways financial statements can be 
manipulated to make a company appear more profitable than it actually is. Because pre-tax 
income will increase by the full amount of the expense or liability not recorded, this financial 
statement fraud method can have a significant impact on reported earnings with relatively 
little effort by the fraudster. It is much easier to commit than falsifying sales transactions. 
Missing transactions can also be harder for auditors to detect than improperly recorded ones 
since the missing transactions leave no audit trail. 
 
There are three common methods for concealing liabilities and expenses:  
• Liability/expense omissions 
• Capitalized expenses 
• Failure to disclose warranty costs and liabilities 
 
Liability/Expense Omissions  
The preferred and easiest method of concealing liabilities or expenses is to simply fail to 
record them. Multi-million-dollar judgments ag ainst a company from a recent court decision 
might be conveniently ignored. Vendor invoices might be thrown away or stuffed into 
drawers rather than posted into the accounts payable system, thereby increasing reported 
earnings by the full amount of the invoices. In a retail environment, debit memos might be 
created for chargebacks to vendors, supposedly to claim permitted rebates or allowances but 
sometimes solely to create additional income. Whether or not these items are properly 
recorded in a subsequent accounting period does not change the fraudulent nature of the 
current financial statements. 
 
Often, perpetrators of liability and expense omissions believe they can conceal their frauds in 
future periods. They frequently plan to compensate for their omitted liabilities with visions 
of other income sources such as profits from future price increases. 
 
Just as they are easy to conceal, omitted lia bilities are probably one of the most difficult 
schemes to uncover. A thorough review of all post-financial-statement-date transactions, 
such as accounts payable increases and decreases, can aid in the discovery of omitted 
liabilities in financial statements, as can a computerized analysis of expense records. 
Additionally, if the auditor requested and was granted unrestricted access to the client’s files, 
a physical search could turn up concealed invoices and unposted liabilities. Probing

interviews of accounts payable and other personnel can reveal unrecorded or delayed items 
too.  
 
EXAMPLE 
In July 2002, the SEC filed suit in the United States Dis trict Court for the Southern 
District of New York, charging major cable television producer Adelphia Communications 
Corporation (“the Company” or “Adelphia”); its founder John J. Rigas; his three sons, 
Timothy J. Rigas, Michael J. Rigas, and James P. Rigas; and two senior executives at 
Adelphia, James R. Brown and Michael C. Mulcahey, in one of the most extensive 
financial frauds ever to take place at a public company. The SEC charged that Adelphia, 
at the direction of the individual defendants (1) fraudulently excluded over $2.3 billion in 
liabilities from its consolidated financial statements by hiding them in off balance sheet 
affiliates; (2) falsified operations statistics and inflated Adelphia’s earnings to meet Wall 
Street’s expectations; and (3) concealed rampant self-dealing by the Rigas Family, 
including the undisclosed use of corporate fu nds for Rigas Family stock purchases and the 
acquisition of luxury condominiums in New York and elsewhere. 
 
With respect to the concealed liabilities, the complaint alleged that between mid-1999 and 
the end of 2001, John J. Rigas, Timothy J. Ri gas, Michael J. Rigas, James P. Rigas, and 
James R. Brown, with the assistance of Michael C. Mulcahey, caused Adelphia to 
fraudulently exclude from the Company’s a nnual and quarterly consolidated financial 
statements over $2.3 billion in bank debt by deliberately shifting those liabilities onto the 
books of Adelphia’s off balance sheet, unconsolidated affiliates. Failure to record this debt 
violated GAAP requirements and precipitated a series of misrepresentations about those 
liabilities by Adelphia and the defendants, including the creation of (1) sham transactions 
backed by fictitious documents to give the false appearance that Adelphia had actually 
repaid debts when, in truth, it had simply shi fted them to unconsoli dated Rigas-controlled 
entities, and (2) misleading financial statements  by giving the false impression through the 
use of footnotes that liabilities listed in the Company’s financials included all outstanding 
bank debt. 
 
In November 2002, in exchange for his testimony against the Rigas men, James Brown 
was released from prosecution by  consenting to an entry of a permanent injunction against 
him for federal securities law violations. Additionally, Brown has been permanently barred 
from becoming an officer or director of a public corporation.

1.324                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
In July 2004, after a three-month trial, a federal jury convicted John and Timothy Rigas of 
conspiracy, securities fraud, and bank fraud. John Rigas received a 15-year prison sentence 
and was fined $2,300, and Timothy Rigas was sentenced to 20 years in prison. James 
Rigas was never criminally charged by the Court. In November 2005, Michael Rigas 
pleaded guilty to a charge of making a false entry in a financial record. 
 
In April 2005, the SEC filed permanent injunctions against John, Timothy, Michael, 
and James Rigas, as well as James Brown, Michael Mulcahey, and Adelphia 
Communications Corporation. The defendants were charged with violating anti-fraud, 
periodic reporting, record keep ing, and internal control provisions of federal securities laws. 
In addition, the Rigas family members were barred from ever holding officer or director 
positions in a public company.  
 
Capitalized Expenses  
Capitalizing expenses is another way to increase income and assets because capitalized items 
are depreciated or amortized over a period of years rather than expensed immediately. If 
expenditures are capitalized as assets and not expensed during the current period, income 
will be overstated. As the assets are depreciated, income in subsequent periods will be 
understated.  
 
EXAMPLE 
In November 2002, the SEC filed an am ended complaint against WorldCom, Inc., 
broadening its charges to allege that WorldCom  misled investors from at least as early as 
1999 through the first quarter of 2002. The complaint stated that the company had 
acknowledged that during that period Worl dCom materially overstated the income it 
reported on its financial statements by approx imately $9 billion, main ly using two methods. 
First, WorldCom reduced its operating expenses  by improperly releasing as a credit to 
operating expenses certain provisions previously established for line costs and for taxes. 
Second, the company improperly reduced its operating expenses by recharacterizing certain 
expenses as capital assets. Much  of the $9 billion related to  improper accounting for “line 
costs,” which were among WorldCom’s major operating expenses. The SEC complaint 
alleges that, in a scheme directed and approved by members of senior management, 
WorldCom concealed the true extent of its “l ine costs.” By improperly reducing provisions 
held against “line costs” and by transferring  certain “line costs” to its capital asset 
accounts, WorldCom falsely portrayed itself as a profitable business when it was not and 
concealed large losses. These improp er accounting practices were designed to and did inflate 
Financial Transactions  Financial Statement Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.325 
income to correspond with estimates by Wall Street analysts and to support the price of 
WorldCom’s stock. 
 
In March 2005, former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers was convicted of one count of 
conspiracy, one count of securities fraud, and seven counts of false regulatory filing, and was 
later sentenced to 25 years in prison. He also agreed to forfeit nearly all of his personal 
assets to settle a civil suit filed by aggrieved WorldCom investors.  
 
Scott Sullivan, the former CFO under Ebbers and “the architect” behind the fraud 
scheme, pled guilty to fraud charges and agreed to testify against Ebbers. Due to his 
cooperation during the investigation, he was sentenced to only five years in prison. He also 
agreed to forfeit the proceeds from the sale of his $10 million home, along with his 401(k) 
holdings, to settle the civil suit brought by shareholders.  
 
Former WorldCom Controller David F. Myers and former Director of General 
Accounting Buford “Buddy” Yates, Jr., pled gu ilty to criminal charges prosecuted by the 
U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. Myers received a sentence  
of one year and one day in prison. Yates was also sentenced to one year and one day in 
prison and ordered to pay a $5,000 fine. Additionally, each man was permanently 
enjoined from acting as an officer or director  of any public company and was suspended from 
practicing before the SEC as an accountan t, under Rule 102(2) of the Commission’s 
Rules of Practice.  
 
The SEC also brought civil actions against former members of the WorldCom General 
Accounting Department, Betty L. Vinson, CPA and Troy M. Normand. Both were 
permanently enjoined from securities violation s. Vinson was suspended from appearing or 
practicing before the SEC as an accountant. In addition, she pled guilty to one count of 
securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and was sentenced to 
five months in prison and five  months of house arrest. Norm and pled guilty to similar 
charges and received three years of probation for his role in the fraud.  
 
EXPENSING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 
Just as capitalizing expenses is improper, so is expensing costs that should be capitalized. 
The organization may want to minimize its net income due to tax considerations, or to 
increase earnings in future periods. Expensing an item that should be depreciated over a 
period of time helps to accomplish just that—net income is lower and, therefore, so are 
taxes.

1.326                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Returns and Allowances and Warranties   
Improper recording of sales returns and allowances occurs when a company fails to properly 
record or present the expense associated with sales returns and customer allowances 
stemming from customer dissatisfaction. It is inevitable that a certain percentage of products 
sold will, for one reason or another, be returned. When this happens, management must 
record the related expense as a contra-sales account, which reduces the amount of net sales 
presented on the company’s income statement.  
 
Likewise, when a company offers a warranty on product sales, it must estimate the amount 
of warranty expense it reasonably expects to incur over the warranty period and accrue a 
liability for that amount. In warranty liability fraud, the warranty liability is usually either 
omitted altogether or substantially understated. Another similar area is the liability resulting 
from defective products (product liability). 
 
What Red Flags Are Associated with Concealed Liabilities and Expenses? 
• Recurring negative cash flows from operations or an inability to generate positive cash 
flows from operations while reporting earnings and earnings growth. 
• Assets, liabilities, revenues, or expenses based on significant estimates that involve 
subjective judgments or uncertainties that are difficult to support. 
• Non-financial management’s excessive part icipation in or preoccupation with the 
selection of accounting principles or the determination of significant estimates. 
• Unusual increase in gross margin or margin in excess of industry peers. 
• Allowances for sales returns, warranty claims, etc., that are shrinking in percentage terms 
or are otherwise out of line with industry peers. 
• Unusual reduction in the number of days’ purchases in accounts payable ratio. 
• Reducing accounts payable while competitors are stretching out payments to vendors. 
 
Improper Disclosures 
Accounting principles require that financial statements include all the information necessary 
to prevent a reasonably discerning user of the financial statements from being misled. The 
notes should include narrative disclosures, supporting schedules, and any other information 
required to avoid misleading potential investors, creditors, or any other users of the financial 
statements.  
 
Management has an obligation to disclose all significant information appropriately in the 
financial statements and in management’s discussion and analysis. In addition, the disclosed 
Financial Transactions  Financial Statement Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.327 
information must not be misleading. Improper disclosures relating to financial statement 
fraud usually involve the following: 
• Liability omissions 
• Subsequent events 
• Management fraud 
• Related-party transactions 
• Accounting changes 
 
Liability Omissions 
Typical omissions include the failure to disclose loan covenants or contingent liabilities. 
Loan covenants are agreements, in addition to or as part of a financing arrangement, that a 
borrower has promised to keep as long as the financing is in place. The agreements can 
contain various types of covenants, including certain financial ratio limits and restrictions on 
other major financing arrangements. Contingent liabilities are potential obligations that will 
materialize only if certain events occur in the future. A corporate guarantee of personal loans 
taken out by an officer or a private company controlled by an officer is an example of a 
contingent liability. The company’s potential lia bility, if material, must be disclosed.  
 
Subsequent Events 
Events occurring or becoming known after the close of the period may have a significant 
effect on the financial statements and should be disclosed. Fraudsters typically avoid 
disclosing court judgments and regulatory decisions that undermine the reported values of 
assets, that indicate unrecorded liabilities, or that adversely reflect upon management 
integrity. Public record searches can reveal this information.  
 
Management Fraud 
Management has an obligation to disclose to the shareholders significant frauds committed 
by officers, executives, and others in positions of trust. Withholding such information from 
auditors would likely also involve lying to auditors, an illegal act in itself.  
 
Related-Party Transactions 
Related-party transactions occur when a company does business with another entity whose 
management or operating policies can be controlled or significantly influenced by the 
company or by some other party in common. There is nothing inherently wrong with 
related-party transactions, as long as they are fully disclosed. If the transactions are not 
conducted on an arm’s-length basis, the company may suffer economic harm, injuring 
Financial Statement Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.328                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
stockholders. The financial interest that a company official might have may not be readily 
apparent. For example, common directors of two companies that do business with each 
other, any corporate general partner and the partnerships with which it does business, and 
any controlling shareholder of the corporation with which he/she/it does business may be 
related-parties. Family relationships can also be considered related parties, such as all lineal 
descendants and ancestors, without regard to financial interests. Related-party transactions 
are sometimes referred to as “self-dealing.” While these transactions are sometimes 
conducted at arm’s length, often they are not.  
 
EXAMPLE 
In September 2002, the SEC charged former top executives of Tyco International Ltd., 
including former CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski, with violating the federal securities laws by 
failing to disclose to shareholders hundreds of millions of dollars of low-interest and interest-free 
loans they took from the company, and in some cases, never repaid. The SEC 
complaint, which also charged former Tyc o CFO Mark H. Swartz and Chief Legal 
Officer Mark A. Belnick, alleges that the three former executives also sold shares of Tyco 
stock valued at millions of dollars while their self-dealing remained undisclosed. The 
complaint alleges numerous improper transact ions, including Kozlowski’s use of $242 
million of loans for impermissible and una uthorized purposes, including funding an 
extravagant lifestyle. With these undisclosed loans, Kozlowski allegedly amassed millions of 
dollars in fine art, yachts, and estate jewelry, as well as a $31 million Park Avenue 
apartment and a palatial estate in Nantucket.  Kozlowski and Swartz allegedly engaged in 
undisclosed non-arm’s-length real estate transactions with Tyco or its subsidiaries and 
received undisclosed compensation and perqui sites, including forgiveness of multi-million- 
dollar loans, rent-free use of large New York apartments, and use of corporate aircraft for 
personal purposes at little or no cost. 
 
In July 2004, Belnick was acquitted of all the charges brought against him. In a separate 
trial, Kozlowski and Swartz were each found gu ilty of 22 charges, in cluding grand larceny, 
falsifying business records, cons piracy, and securities fraud, and were sentenced to eight and 
one-third to 25 years in prison. 
 
Accounting Changes 
In general, three types of accounting changes must be disclosed to avoid misleading the user 
of financial statements: accounting principles, estimates, and reporting entities. Although the 
required treatment for each type of change is different, they are all susceptible to 
Financial Transactions  Financial Statement Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.329 
manipulation by a determined fraudster. For example, fraudsters may fail to properly 
retroactively restate financial statements for a change in accounting principle if the change 
causes the company’s financial statements to appear weaker. Likewise, they may fail to 
disclose significant changes in estimates such as the useful lives and estimated salvage values 
of depreciable assets, or the estimates underlying the determination of warranty or other 
liabilities. They may even secretly change the reporting entity, by adding entities owned 
privately by management or by excluding certain company-owned units, in order to improve 
reported results.  
 
Backdating Stock Options 
As a supplement to salary, companies frequently offer employees stock options, which grant 
the recipient the privilege to purchase a share of the company’s stock at a future date for a 
specific price called the strike price. A strike price is the value of a share at a particular date. 
Generally, the strike price is set at the price of the underlying stock on the day the option is 
granted; therefore, the option becomes valuable only with future increases in the stock price.  
In this way, companies grant stock options as an incentive for employees to boost company 
performance and thus raise the stock price. The practice of backdating stock options, 
however, gives the employee a chance to profit by purchasing stock at past low prices, 
providing an immediate payoff. Backdating stock options occurs when a company alters the 
date of the grant to a time when the stock was trading at a lower price in the interest of 
making the option instantly valuable and further increasing the employee’s gain if the stock 
price continues to rise.  
 
EXAMPLE 
On June 1, 20X1, Company XYZ grants its CEO a stock option that provides the 
executive the right to purchase 100 shares of XYZ stock on January 1, 20X2 for the 
strike price. Per its usual policy, the strike price is set at the price of the company stock on 
the date of the option grant. On June 1, 2008  (the grant date), XYZ stock was trading at 
$40 per share. Therefore, if the stock price increases to $45 per share by January 1, 
20X2, the CEO could exercise the option and purchase the shares for $40 per share, then 
sell them immediately on the market for $45 per share, resulting in a gain of $5 per share. 
However, the company has recently experienced a dramatic increase in its share price. On 
May 24, 20X1, the stock was trading for $15 per share. To provide the CEO with an 
opportunity to exploit this increase in share price, the company chooses to backdate the 
stock options to make it appear that they  were granted on May 24, 20X1. Because the 
strike price is set at the price of the stock on the option grant date, the strike price is 
Financial Statement Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.330                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
effectively changed to $15 per share. As a result, the CEO now has the option to buy 100 
shares of XYZ stock on January 1, 20X2 for $15 per share. Thus, the CEO has 
immediately gained $25 per share (the difference  between the stock price on the actual grant 
date of June 1 and the stated grant date of May 24) based solely on the manipulation of 
the grant date used.  
 
Backdating stock options came to the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) when academic research revealed a pattern of stock prices descending 
just prior to many reported dates of option grants, then ascending immediately afterwards. 
Backdating is not necessarily illegal, but can be if not handled appropriately. In order to be 
legal, the practice must be explicitly reported to shareholders and the government. Failure to 
do so may constitute securities fraud.  
 
In August of 2002, certain provisions laid out under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act took effect, 
requiring companies to report stock option grants within two business days after the grants. 
The rules greatly reduced the time companies had to choose a favorable grant date; 
companies were previously allowed weeks or months before they were required to report 
stock option grants. Consequently, the apparent pattern of backdating nearly disappeared 
around the time the rules were enacted. However, reports of actual practices in stock options 
and the recorded data remain inconsistent in many cases because not all companies adhere 
to Sarbanes-Oxley. Additionally, the revelation of the prevalence of backdating has caused 
concern that companies may not have recorded and disclosed the option grants on the 
financial statements in an accurate manner. In response to this issue, the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued a practice alert to prepare auditors for the 
possibility of financial misstatements due to backdating of stock options. To keep a tight 
rope on the possibility of this type of illegal activity, auditors should assess the information 
obtained from the audit to determine if there is a need for further audit procedures. 
 
What Red Flags Are Associated with Improper Disclosures? 
• Domination of management by a single person or small group (in a nonowner-managed 
business) without compensating controls. 
• Ineffective board of directors or audit committee oversight over the financial reporting 
process and internal control. 
• Ineffective communication, implementation, support, or enforcement of the entity’s 
values or ethical standards by management or the communication of inappropriate 
values or ethical standards. 
Financial Transactions  Financial Statement Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.331 
• Rapid growth or unusual profitability, especially compared to that of other companies in 
the same industry. 
• Significant, unusual, or highly complex transactions, especially those close to a period’s 
end that pose difficult “substance over form” questions. 
• Significant related-party transactions not in the ordinary course of business or with 
related entities either not audited or audited by a different firm. 
• Significant bank accounts or subsidiary or branch operations in tax-haven jurisdictions 
for which there appears to be no clear business justification. 
• Overly complex organizational structure invo lving unusual legal entities or managerial 
lines of authority. 
• Known history of violations of securities la ws or other laws and regulations, or claims 
against the entity, its senior management, or board members alleging fraud or violations 
of laws and regulations. 
• Recurring attempts by management to justify marginal or inappropriate accounting on 
the basis of materiality. 
• Formal or informal restrictions on the auditor that inappropriately limit access to people 
or information, or limit the ability of the auditor to communicate effectively with the 
board of directors or audit committee.
