AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS INVENTORY IS IN STOCK  
The average number of days inventory is in stock ratio is a 
restatement of the inventory turnover ratio expressed in days. This rate is important for 
several reasons. An increase in the number of days inventory stays in stock causes additional 
expenses, including storage costs, risk of inventory obsolescence, and market price 
reductions, as well as interest and other expenses incurred due to tying up funds in inventory 
stock. Inconsistency or significant variance in this ratio is a red flag for fraud investigators. 
Examiners may use this ratio to examine inventory accounts for possible larceny schemes. 
Purchasing and receiving inventory schemes can affect the ratio. As well, understating the 
cost of goods sold will result in an increase in the ratio. Significant changes in the inventory 
turnover ratio are good indicators of possible fraudulent inventory activity.
