Related-Party Transactions 
Related-party transactions occur when a company does business with another entity whose 
management or operating policies can be controlled or significantly influenced by the 
company or by some other party in common. There is nothing inherently wrong with 
related-party transactions, as long as they are fully disclosed. If the transactions are not 
conducted on an arm’s-length basis, the company may suffer economic harm, injuring

stockholders. The financial interest that a company official might have may not be readily 
apparent. For example, common directors of two companies that do business with each 
other, any corporate general partner and the partnerships with which it does business, and 
any controlling shareholder of the corporation with which he/she/it does business may be 
related-parties. Family relationships can also be considered related parties, such as all lineal 
descendants and ancestors, without regard to financial interests. Related-party transactions 
are sometimes referred to as “self-dealing.” While these transactions are sometimes 
conducted at arm’s length, often they are not.  
 
EXAMPLE 
In September 2002, the SEC charged former top executives of Tyco International Ltd., 
including former CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski, with violating the federal securities laws by 
failing to disclose to shareholders hundreds of millions of dollars of low-interest and interest-free 
loans they took from the company, and in some cases, never repaid. The SEC 
complaint, which also charged former Tyc o CFO Mark H. Swartz and Chief Legal 
Officer Mark A. Belnick, alleges that the three former executives also sold shares of Tyco 
stock valued at millions of dollars while their self-dealing remained undisclosed. The 
complaint alleges numerous improper transact ions, including Kozlowski’s use of $242 
million of loans for impermissible and una uthorized purposes, including funding an 
extravagant lifestyle. With these undisclosed loans, Kozlowski allegedly amassed millions of 
dollars in fine art, yachts, and estate jewelry, as well as a $31 million Park Avenue 
apartment and a palatial estate in Nantucket.  Kozlowski and Swartz allegedly engaged in 
undisclosed non-arm’s-length real estate transactions with Tyco or its subsidiaries and 
received undisclosed compensation and perqui sites, including forgiveness of multi-million- 
dollar loans, rent-free use of large New York apartments, and use of corporate aircraft for 
personal purposes at little or no cost. 
 
In July 2004, Belnick was acquitted of all the charges brought against him. In a separate 
trial, Kozlowski and Swartz were each found gu ilty of 22 charges, in cluding grand larceny, 
falsifying business records, cons piracy, and securities fraud, and were sentenced to eight and 
one-third to 25 years in prison.
