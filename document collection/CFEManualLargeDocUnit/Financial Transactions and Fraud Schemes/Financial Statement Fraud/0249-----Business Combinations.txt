Business Combinations 
Companies are required to allocate the purchase price they have paid to acquire another 
business to the tangible and intangible assets of that business. Any excess of the purchase 
price over the value of the acquired assets is treated as goodwill. Current standards 
governing goodwill accounting have decreased the incentive for companies to minimize the 
amount allocated to goodwill that previously was required to be amortized against future 
earnings. However, companies may still be tempted to over-allocate the purchase price to in-
 process research and development assets, in order to then write them off immediately. Or 
they may establish excessive reserves for various expenses at the time of acquisition, 
intending to quietly release those excess reserves into earnings at a future date.
