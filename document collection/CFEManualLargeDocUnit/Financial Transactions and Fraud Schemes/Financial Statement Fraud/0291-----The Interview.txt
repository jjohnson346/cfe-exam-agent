The Interview 
Fraud examiners and auditors should ask questions designed to elicit the most specific 
information possible in a professional manner.  
 
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
Generally, the CEO should be interviewed first in any proactive or reactive fraud situation. 
There are several good reasons for this approach. First of all, the auditor or fraud examiner 
must have a thorough understanding with management as to what his responsibilities in this 
area are. Second, it is unwise to conduct sensitive inquiries within any organization without 
first advising the CEO. If he learns from some other source that you are making discreet 
fraud-related inquiries without telling him, he is more likely to misunderstand your objectives 
and take the inquiry as a personal affront. Third, if there is any significant cooking of the 
books, the CEO is almost always involved. The fraud-related questions you should ask in 
connection with a regular audit should include, at a minimum, the following. Note how the 
questions are for “set up” purposes. 
 
1. Mr. CEO, as you know, we are required to assess the risk that material fraud exists in every company, 
not just yours. This is sort of a sensitive area for everyone, but our professional responsibilities dictate 
that we address this area. Do you understand? (Wait for an affirmative response before proceeding). 
 
2. Do you have any reason to believe that material fraud is being committed at any level within the 
organization? 
 
Financial Transactions  Financial Statement Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.345 
3. Mr. CEO, one trend in fraud is that small frauds  are committed by employees with little authority, 
which means that the largest ones are usually committed with the knowledge of upper management. Do 
you understand that? (Wait for an affirmative response before proceeding.) 
 
4. Because of that, we are required to at least look at the possibility that all CEOs, including you, might 
commit significant fraud against customers, investors,  or shareholders. Do you understand our situation? 
(Wait for an affirmative response.) 
 
5. So during this audit (examination) we need to ask direct questions ab out this subject to you and your 
staff. As a matter of fact, we will at least discuss the possibility of fraud with every employee we talk with 
in connection with this audit (exa mination). Do you have any problem with that? (Wait for a negative 
response. If the CEO protests, satisfy his objections. If he cannot be satisfied, assess the risk of whether 
the CEO is attempting to obstruct the audit or examination.) 
 
6. First, let’s look at your CFO. Can you think of a reason he might have to get back at you or the 
company by committing fraud? 
 
7. Has the CFO ever asked you to approve any financial transaction  you thought might be improper or 
illegal?   
 
8. Do you know whether the CFO has any outside business interests that might conflict with his duties 
here? 
 
9. Does the CFO employ any friends or relatives in the company? (Look for possible conflicts or sweetheart 
deals.) 
 
10.  What information do you have about the CFO’s lifestyle? (Look for expensive homes, cars, toys, and 
habits.) 
 
11.  What is your general impression of how the CFO gets along with his staff? (Look for abuses of 
authority, etc., that would motivate employees di rectly below the CFO to participate in fraud.) 
 
12.  How do you think fraud in your company compares with others in the same industry? 
 
13.  Of course, Mr. CEO, I must ask you many of the same questions about yourself. Is there any reason 
that anyone below you might claim you are committing fraud against the company? 
Financial Statement Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.346                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
14.  I must also ask you some personal financial quest ions. Do you have any problem with this? (Wait for 
negative response.) 
 
15.  Please give me a current estimate of your personal asset s, liabilities, income, and expenses. (List) What 
percentage of your net worth is tied directly to this  company? (Look for highly leveraged individuals whose 
company holdings are a significant portion of their net worth.) 
 
16.  Are you currently experiencing any personal financial problems? (Look for lawsuits, liens, judgments, or 
other indicators.)    
 
17.  Do you have friends or relatives working for this  company? (Look for conflicts of interest.) 
 
18.  Do you have friends or relatives working for major suppliers or vendors to this company? (Look for 
conflicts of interest.) 
 
19.  Do you own any portion of a company that does business  with this organization? (Look for conflicts of 
interest.) 
 
20.  Hypothetically, if you wanted to pump up your company’s profits, what would be the easiest way to do it? 
 
21.  As I said, we will be required to ask many questions of your staff. Is there any reason why someone who 
works for you would say you are at  risk to commit significant fraud against the company or its 
shareholders? 
 
22.  Mr. CEO, this is the last question, and it should be obvious why I have to ask it. Have you committed 
fraud or other illegal acts against the company? (Do not apologize for asking the question; it’s your job.)     
 
THE CEO’S TOP STAFF 
CEOs of corporations, large and small, are busy individuals. Because they tend to be “big 
picture” people by nature, they rely heavily on their staffs—principally their personal 
assistants—to take care of details. But personal assistants do not usually become closely tied 
to the boss without a demonstrated history of loyalty and discretion. In short, if you make 
the boss’s assistant mad, your fraud-related questions are going to be interpreted in the worst 
possible light, thereby making your job much more difficult. 
 
Financial Transactions  Financial Statement Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.347 
So the key to interviewing the CEO’s top sta ff is to approach the interviewing process 
correctly from the outset. This means laying a great deal of groundwork before asking 
sensitive questions. Start with procedural matters or some other non-sensitive topic, and ask 
the fraud-related questions toward the end of your conversation. 
 
1. Mr. Assistant, part of my job as an auditor (fraud examiner) is to assess the risk that the company’s 
books are not materially correct as a result of fraud by employees or management. I have already talked 
about these issues with your boss. He understands their importance and he is aware that, as part of the 
audit, I will be talking to everyone about the subject to some extent. Do you have any problem with this? 
(Wait for negative response.) 
 
2. Do you think fraud is a problem for bu siness in general? (Icebreaker.) 
 
3. How do you think this company stacks up to others in terms of honesty of its employees and managers? 
 
4. Have you ever heard rumors in the company that someone is committing fraud, especially someone high 
up in the organization? 
 
5. Is the company in any kind of financial trouble that would motivate management to misstate the 
company’s profits? 
 
6. Do you think your coworkers are essentially honest?  
 
7. Has anyone you work with ever asked you to do something you felt was not legal or ethical? 
 
8. How would you handle such a situation? (Solic it information on fraud reporting program.) 
 
9. If someone in a position of authority in the company wanted to commit fraud, what would be the easiest 
way to do it? 
 
10.  As your auditor, may I ask you to report any instances in the future of anyone asking you to do anything 
to the books and records that you feel is not right? (Solicit future cooperation.)

THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER 
In the vast majority of cases the CFO is an integral part of any financial statement fraud, as 
illustrated previously. As a result, the interview with the CFO should concentrate not only 
on possible motivations to commit fraud, but also on the opportunity to do so. Since most 
CFOs are accountants, they should more readily  understand your fraud-related mission. This 
can be good or bad; good if the CFO is hone st, and bad if he isn’t. Among all financial 
personnel, the CFO is in the best position to know how to cook the books and keep it from 
being uncovered. As if that weren’t enough, many CFOs are hired directly from the firms 
that audit the company. Is there any other person more likely to be at the center of the 
fraud?  
 
1. Mr. CFO, you now know that audit standards require us to actively assess the risk that material fraud 
could be affecting the financial statements. We have ta lked with the CEO, and he  is fully aware that we 
will be asking most everyone we  speak with about the possibility of fraud or irregularities. You 
understand this, don’t you? (Wait for affirmative response.) 
 
2. Of the accounts on the company’s books, which do  you suspect might be the most vulnerable to 
manipulation, and why? 
 
3. What kind of history does the company have with fraud in general, including defalcations and employee 
thefts? (Look for signs of a weak corporate culture.) 
 
4. We know that fraud usually exists to some extent—even if it is small—in most companies. How do you 
think your company compares to others? 
 
5. What is your overall impression of the company’s ethics and corporate culture? 
 
6. During our assessment of risk of fraud in your company, are there any specific ar eas you’d like to discuss 
with us? 
 
7. Is there any reason that anyone in  the company might say that management had a motive to misstate the 
financials? 
 
8. Has anyone you work with ever asked you to do  anything with the books that you thought was 
questionable, unethical, or illegal?  
 
Financial Transactions  Financial Statement Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.349 
9. Are you involved in the personal finances of the CEO?  If so, is there anything about them that might 
make you think he is under personal financial pressure? 
 
10. Do either the CEO’s lifestyle or habits give you any reason to think he may be living beyond his means? 
 
11. Has anyone in a position of authority ever asked that you withhold in formation from the auditors, alter 
documents, or make fictitious en tries in the books and records? 
 
12.  Is there anything about your own background or finances that would cause someone to suspect that you 
had a motive for committing fraud? 
 
13.  Because of your importance as CF O, I must ask you one final question: Have you, yourself, committed 
fraud or illegal acts against this company? (Remember—don’t apologize.) 
 
THE ACCOUNTING STAFF 
If a financial statement fraud has been ordered by the CFO, he will either do the actual dirty 
work himself or get his staff to do it. In some cases, the staff will understand the big picture, 
but in most situations, the employee is told only what he needs to know. It is uncommon for 
a CFO to share with a lower staff person the fact that he is cooking the books.  
 
As a result, the examiner generally must complete his audit work before beginning the 
interviews of the accounting staff. This will allow specific transactions to be discussed with 
the people who actually entered them into the company’s records. For example, all thorough 
audits will examine the major journal entries. Frequently, these journal entries will be ordered 
by the CFO, but actually entered by a staff member. There would generally be no record of 
the CFO requesting the entry, so this fact must be established through interviews.  
 
Interviews of the accounting staff will allow sufficient examination of procedures and 
controls over assets. After these questions are answered, you can generally pursue the line of 
inquiry suggested above for the CEO’s assistant. 
 
It should be noted that there are similarities and differences in the questions asked of the 
CEO, the CFO, and their staffs. In the case of the CEO and the CFO, both were specifically 
asked if they had committed fraud against the company, albeit in a nice way. The staffers 
were not asked that specific question.  
 
Financial Statement Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.350                         2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
The reasoning is this: significant financial statement fraud, as we have stated, generally 
originates with one or both of these two executives. Staffers have less motivation to engage 
in financial statement fraud, and are, therefore, at less risk to do so. They are also less likely 
to have the financial authority to enter transactions into the books without higher approval.  
 
So absent any specific information to the contrary, asking the employees point blank if they 
have committed fraud is less likely to produce information and more likely to offend them. 
But with the CFO and the CEO, asking the direct question will add measurably to the 
prevention of fraud. There are few defenses to not asking the question, other than the 
specter of embarrassing the executives you are auditing. That will, of course, sound pretty 
weak in a court of law where you are fighting for your professional life.

the reason is thi signific financi statement fraud as we have state gener
origin with on or both of these two execut staffer have less motiv to engag

to have the financi author to enter transact into the book without higher approv
so absent ani specif inform to the contrari ask the employe point blank if thei
have commit fraud is less like to produc inform and more like to offend them
but with the cfo and the ceo ask the direct question will add measur to the
