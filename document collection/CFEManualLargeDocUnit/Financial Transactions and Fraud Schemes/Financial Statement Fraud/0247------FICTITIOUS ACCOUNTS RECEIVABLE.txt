FICTITIOUS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  
Fictitious accounts receivable are common among companies with financial problems, as 
well as with managers who receive a commission based on sales. The typical entry under 
fictitious accounts receivable is to debit (increase) accounts receivable and credit (increase) 
sales. Of course, these schemes are more common around the end of the accounting period, 
since accounts receivable are expected to be paid in cash within a reasonable time. 
Fraudsters commonly attempt to conceal fictitious accounts receivable by providing false 
confirmations of balances to auditors. They get the audit confirmations because the mailing 
address they provide for the phony customers is typically either a mailbox under their 
control, a home address, or the business address of a coconspirator. Such schemes can be 
detected by using business credit reports, public records, or even the telephone book, to 
identify significant customers with no physical existence or no apparent business need for 
the product sold to them.
