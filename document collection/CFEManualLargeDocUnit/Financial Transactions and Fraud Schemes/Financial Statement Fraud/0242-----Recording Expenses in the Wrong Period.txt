Recording Expenses in the Wrong Period 
The timely recording of expenses is often compromised due to pressures to meet budget 
projections and goals, or due to lack of proper accounting controls. As the expensing of 
certain costs is pushed into periods other than the ones in which they actually occur, they are 
not properly matched against the income that they help produce. For example, revenue may 
be recognized on the sale of certain items, but the cost of goods and services that went into 
the items sold might intentionally not be recorded in the accounting system until the 
subsequent period. This might make the sales revenue from the transaction almost pure 
profit, inflating earnings. In the next period, earnings would be depressed by a similar 
amount.
