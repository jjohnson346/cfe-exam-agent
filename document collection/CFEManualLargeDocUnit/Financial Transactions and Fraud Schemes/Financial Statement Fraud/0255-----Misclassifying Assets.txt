Misclassifying Assets 
In order to meet budget requirements, and for various other reasons, assets are sometimes 
misclassified into general ledger accounts in which they don’t belong. For example, fixed 
assets may be fraudulently reclassified as current assets. The manipulation can skew financial 
ratios and help the company comply with loan covenants or other borrowing requirements.
