Check and Credit Card Fraud

Scanning 
Scanning requires a scanner and a legitimate check. Scanners can be purchased for less than 
$200 and checks are readily available without having to actually steal the check. Checks can 
then be manufactured by scanning a corporate logo from a business card onto a simple 
business-sized check.
