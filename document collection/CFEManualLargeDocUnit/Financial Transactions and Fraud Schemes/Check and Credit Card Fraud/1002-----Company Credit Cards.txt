Company Credit Cards 
Company credit cards are provided to employees for convenience in conduction of company 
business. No personal expenses may be charged on the company credit card except as 
specifically authorized by company procedures. The employee must pay any charged 
personal expenses promptly. Company credit cards should not be used to avoid preparing 
documentation for direct payment to vendors. Where allowed by local law, charges on 
company credit cards for which a properly approved expense report has not been received at 
the time of an employee’s termination of employment may be deducted from the employee’s 
last paycheck. The company will pursue repayment by the employee of any amounts it has to 
pay on the employee’s behalf.
