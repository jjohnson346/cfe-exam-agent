Third-Party Bill Paying Services 
The checks produced by these third-party bill paying service providers do not include the 
payor signature. Instead, the signature line reflects something such as “signature on file.” 
Unauthorized checks produced by third-party payment services are not usually detected until 
the customer reviews the monthly bank statement. By the time the customer identifies the 
unauthorized check, it is often too late to recover the funds, since the “24-hour window” 
(actually until midnight of the next banking day) for the timely return of checks has long 
since passed. These checks usually sail right through the check sorting operation, since they 
include good account information and sometimes even include good serial numbers. Too 
often, both business and individual account holders seem unaware of how their account 
information, given too freely to a requesting party, can be used for fraudulent purposes.
