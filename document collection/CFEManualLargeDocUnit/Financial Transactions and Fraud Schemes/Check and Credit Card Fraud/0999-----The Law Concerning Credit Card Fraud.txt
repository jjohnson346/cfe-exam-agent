The Law Concerning Credit Card Fraud 
Federal law deals with legal principles surrounding losses from the fraudulent use of credit 
cards. Unlike check fraud, which is primarily governed by state law, credit card fraud is 
governed by federal law. Even so, the federal laws and regulations governing credit cards, 
however, pertain only to the relationship between the card issuer and the cardholder. Thus, 
contract law and the contractual agreement between the merchant and the merchant’s bank, 
as well as the merchant’s bank and the issuing bank, are typically what regulates the outcome 
of fraudulent credit card usage.  
 
The most important legal principles concerning the allocation of losses between credit card 
issuers and credit card holders come from Regulation Z of the Federal Reserve System, 
which was promulgated pursuant to the federal Truth-In-Lending Act (TILA).  
 
Congress designed TILA to protect consumers; therefore, its provisions generally do not 
apply to creditors that extend credit primarily for business, agricultural, or commercial 
purposes. TILA, however, defers to any state la w that gives greater protection and benefit to 
consumers, so state law that provides consumer cardholders more rights than federal law will 
prevail where there is a conflict.  
 
The provisions of Regulation Z that are most re levant to credit card fraud place limitations 
on a cardholder’s liability for unauthorized use. Under TILA, the term “cardholder” includes 
any person or organization to which a card is issued for any purpose—including a business, 
agricultural, or commercial purpose. This constitutes an exception to the general rule that 
most TILA provisions do not apply to credit card transactions for business, agricultural, or 
commercial purposes. 
 
The basic liability rule provides that the cardholder is not liable for unauthorized use of the 
card. The card issuer can shift from unauthorized use back to the cardholder only if: 
• The card is an “accepted” credit card (i.e., one that the cardholder has requested and

signed, used, or has authorized another person to use). 
• The cardholder’s liability is not more than $50. 
• The card issuer has given notice to the cardholder of the potential liability. 
• The card issuer has provided the cardholder with a description of the means by which 
the card issuer may be notified of loss or theft of the card, either on the periodic 
statement that the issuer sends to the consumer or on a separate notice that accompanies 
that statement. 
• The unauthorized use occurs before the card issuer has been notified that an 
unauthorized use of the credit card. 
• The card issuer has provided a method by which the user of the card can be identified as 
the person authorized to use it. 
 
The Federal Reserve Board staff has interpreted Regulation Z to impose the $50 limit to a 
“series of unauthorized uses.” Assume, for instance, that a thief steals a credit card and, 
within a relatively short period of time, uses the credit card to make separate $100 purchases 
at three different stores. The consumer may maintain that, under the Federal Reserve Board 
staff interpretation, the card issuer may only impose one $50 charge because the transactions 
were all part of the same series.
