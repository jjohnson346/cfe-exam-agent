Consumer Initiation 
Notice that the definition of electronic fund transfer applies literally only to consumer 
transactions. One might speculate that if the consumer does not actually use the terminal, 
the transaction is not an electronic fund transfer. If, for instance, a consumer desires to 
purchase goods and hands the merchant a debit card to pay for the transaction, one might 
argue that the consumer has not initiated the transaction. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve 
Board has construed the definition to apply to a POS terminal that captures data 
electronically in order to debit or credit a consumer’s bank account. This definition is broad 
enough to include the situation in which a merchant physically swipes or inserts the 
consumer’s debit card through the terminal, but does so at the direction of the consumer. In 
any event, the transaction would constitute an electronic fund transfer under the part of the 
definition that includes transfer “initiated through computer.” 
 
Even though a telephone is not itself an electronic terminal, transfers that the consumer 
initiates by telephone may be considered electronic transfer funds. Telephone transfers 
(which likely include fax transmissions) fall within the EFTA if made pursuant to a 
prearranged plan or agreement that is entered into between the consumer and the financial 
institution making the transfer and that contemplates periodic or recurring transfers. If an 
effective agreement exists, a transfer that the consumer initiates by telephone falls within the 
EFTA, even though an employee of the bank completes the transfer, or the consumer 
initiates the transfer through a facsimile machine, or the consumer initiates the transfer 
through the bank’s audio- or voice-response telephone system.
