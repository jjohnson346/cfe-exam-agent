Organized Crime Rings 
Nigerian rings are especially notorious for stealing credit card and bank information from 
the mail. These articles are used to generate false identification documents, such as driver’s 
licenses and Social Security cards. The credit cards themselves are duplicated and distributed 
to members of the rings. The false IDs are then displayed during purchases made with the

stolen cards. Members of the ring go on spending sprees, ending only when the credit has 
dried up or the legitimate owner reports their card as stolen. Often, counterfeit and stolen 
cards are express-mailed to members of the ring in other parts of the country.
