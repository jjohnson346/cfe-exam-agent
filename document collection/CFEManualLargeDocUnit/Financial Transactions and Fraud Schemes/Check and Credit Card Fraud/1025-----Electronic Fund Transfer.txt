Electronic Fund Transfer Fraud Protection: Identity Theft to Wire Transfer Fraud.” There 
is relatively low processing and customer service costs for billers, while customers can 
reduce time and costs in making payments. With some EBPP systems, some customers may 
even be able to manage their funds more effectively. Electronic bill payment has received 
faster acceptance than bill presentment, though acceptance appears to be dependent on the 
prices of these services. As the EBPP method of payment continues to increase, it is 
important to be prepared to combat fraud that may surface in this area.  
 
Electronic Fund Trans fer 
The Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) is intended to protect the rights of consumers. 
Unlike the state law that governs checks or wholesale wire transfers, the law concerning 
electronic fund transfers initiated from consumer accounts is federal law.  
 
As defined in the EFTA, an “electronic fund transfer” is any transfer of funds, other than 
one originated by a check or similar paper instrument, that is initiated through an electronic 
terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer or magnetic tape that orders or purports to 
authorize a financial institution to debit or credit an account. Each of the following would 
constitute an electronic fund transfer for purposes of federal law: 
• A customer’s withdrawal of funds from the customer’s own account by use of an ATM. 
• A customer’s transfer of funds from the c ustomer’s checking account to the customer’s 
savings account at the same financial institution initiated by the customer through his 
personal computer.  
• A customer’s transfer of funds from the customer’s checking account to the customer’s 
savings account at the same financial institution initiated by the customer through the 
bank’s automated telephone service. 
• A customer’s use of a debit card to purchase goods from a merchant who swipes the 
customer’s card through a point-of-sale (POS) device to authorize deduction of the 
amount of the sale from the customer’s checking account. 
• A customer’s transfer of funds from his bank account to a third-party initiated by the 
customer through his personal computer. 
• An employer’s instruction, initiated by computer or through a magnetic tape, to a 
financial institution to deposit funds representing an employee’s pay into the  
employee’s account. 
• A noncustomer’s instruction, initiated by computer or through a magnetic tape, to a 
financial institution to withdraw funds from the checking account of a customer and 
transfer the funds of a noncustomer’s bank account.

The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated a series of regulations, known as Regulation E, 
which informs banks of how they must implement the EFTA. Banks must be aware of their 
obligations under these laws and regulations in order both to minimize their exposure to 
electronic fund transfer fraud and to know how to deal with their customers when such 
fraud occurs. Under these laws and regulations, EBPP and P2P systems will usually qualify 
as electronic fund transfers. Other transactions that are initiated by the consumer through 
computer or telephonic instruments without the intervention of bank personnel, including 
transactions involving debit cards and automated teller machine (ATM) transactions, may 
also qualify as electronic fund transfers.
