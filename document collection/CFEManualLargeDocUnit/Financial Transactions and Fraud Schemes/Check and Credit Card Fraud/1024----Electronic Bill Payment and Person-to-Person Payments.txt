Electronic Bill Payment and Person-to-Person Payments 
Increasingly, consumers are using electronic funds transfers, rather than actual currency or 
paper, to pay bills or make online purchases. Through online services offered by many 
financial institutions, an individual can make banking transactions using a system called 
electronic bill payment and presentment, or EBPP. Individuals can pay each other for goods or 
services through this same electronic form, which is known as the person-to-person, or P2P, 
system.  
 
Although these systems are still young, some experts suggest that they will play an important 
part in the way payments are made, according to the Sheshunoff and A.S. Pratt’s publication, 
Financial Transactions  Check and Credit Card Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1035 
“Electronic Fund Transfer Fraud Protection: Identity Theft to Wire Transfer Fraud.” There 
is relatively low processing and customer service costs for billers, while customers can 
reduce time and costs in making payments. With some EBPP systems, some customers may 
even be able to manage their funds more effectively. Electronic bill payment has received 
faster acceptance than bill presentment, though acceptance appears to be dependent on the 
prices of these services. As the EBPP method of payment continues to increase, it is 
important to be prepared to combat fraud that may surface in this area.  
 
Electronic Fund Trans fer 
The Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) is intended to protect the rights of consumers. 
Unlike the state law that governs checks or wholesale wire transfers, the law concerning 
electronic fund transfers initiated from consumer accounts is federal law.  
 
As defined in the EFTA, an “electronic fund transfer” is any transfer of funds, other than 
one originated by a check or similar paper instrument, that is initiated through an electronic 
terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer or magnetic tape that orders or purports to 
authorize a financial institution to debit or credit an account. Each of the following would 
constitute an electronic fund transfer for purposes of federal law: 
• A customer’s withdrawal of funds from the customer’s own account by use of an ATM. 
• A customer’s transfer of funds from the c ustomer’s checking account to the customer’s 
savings account at the same financial institution initiated by the customer through his 
personal computer.  
• A customer’s transfer of funds from the customer’s checking account to the customer’s 
savings account at the same financial institution initiated by the customer through the 
bank’s automated telephone service. 
• A customer’s use of a debit card to purchase goods from a merchant who swipes the 
customer’s card through a point-of-sale (POS) device to authorize deduction of the 
amount of the sale from the customer’s checking account. 
• A customer’s transfer of funds from his bank account to a third-party initiated by the 
customer through his personal computer. 
• An employer’s instruction, initiated by computer or through a magnetic tape, to a 
financial institution to deposit funds representing an employee’s pay into the  
employee’s account. 
• A noncustomer’s instruction, initiated by computer or through a magnetic tape, to a 
financial institution to withdraw funds from the checking account of a customer and 
transfer the funds of a noncustomer’s bank account.

The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated a series of regulations, known as Regulation E, 
which informs banks of how they must implement the EFTA. Banks must be aware of their 
obligations under these laws and regulations in order both to minimize their exposure to 
electronic fund transfer fraud and to know how to deal with their customers when such 
fraud occurs. Under these laws and regulations, EBPP and P2P systems will usually qualify 
as electronic fund transfers. Other transactions that are initiated by the consumer through 
computer or telephonic instruments without the intervention of bank personnel, including 
transactions involving debit cards and automated teller machine (ATM) transactions, may 
also qualify as electronic fund transfers.  
 
Access Device 
An “access device” includes a card, code, or other means of access to a customer’s account 
for the purpose of initiating electronic fund transfers. These include debit cards, personal 
identification numbers (PINs), telephone transfer and bill payment codes, and other means 
that a consumer may use to initiate an electronic fund transfer from his account. A 
consumer’s account is considered an asset account, such as a demand deposit or savings 
account, established for personal, family, or household purposes. A credit card is not 
considered an access device since it provides access to a credit line rather than to a 
consumer’s account. The term “access device” does not include a check or draft used to 
capture to MICR encoding to initiate a one-time ACH debit. For example, if a customer 
authorizes a single ACH debit from his account by giving a check to the merchant so they 
can capture the routing, account, and serial numbers to initiate the debit, the check is not an 
access device. If the customer, however, provides a payee with a check, or with information 
from a check that is physically retained by the consumer, in order to allow the payee to 
capture routing, account, and serial number information, the result transfer does constitute 
an electronic fund transfer.  
 
When an access devise is necessary to instruct a financial institution to perform a transfer, 
the financial institution will be able to claim that it was authorized to debit or credit a 
consumer’s account only if the transfer was initiated through use of an “accepted” access 
device. An access device will qualify for this status only if the devise was issued to a person: 
• Who requested and received it. 
• Who signed and used it. 
• Who authorized another to use the access device. 
• For the purpose of transferring money between accounts or obtaining money, property, 
labor, or services. 
Financial Transactions  Check and Credit Card Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1037 
If a consumer uses an accepted access device to initiate a transfer, the EFTA will cover the 
transaction, even though a bank employee has intervened to complete the transaction. 
Assume, for instance, that Smith wishes to transfer $100 from her checking account to her 
savings account. She asks the teller at her bank to perform the transaction. The teller 
requests that Smith enter her PIN into a card-reading device at the teller’s station. If the PIN 
is used to initiate the transfer, the transaction is an electronic fund transfer. 
 
Consumer Initiation 
Notice that the definition of electronic fund transfer applies literally only to consumer 
transactions. One might speculate that if the consumer does not actually use the terminal, 
the transaction is not an electronic fund transfer. If, for instance, a consumer desires to 
purchase goods and hands the merchant a debit card to pay for the transaction, one might 
argue that the consumer has not initiated the transaction. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve 
Board has construed the definition to apply to a POS terminal that captures data 
electronically in order to debit or credit a consumer’s bank account. This definition is broad 
enough to include the situation in which a merchant physically swipes or inserts the 
consumer’s debit card through the terminal, but does so at the direction of the consumer. In 
any event, the transaction would constitute an electronic fund transfer under the part of the 
definition that includes transfer “initiated through computer.” 
 
Even though a telephone is not itself an electronic terminal, transfers that the consumer 
initiates by telephone may be considered electronic transfer funds. Telephone transfers 
(which likely include fax transmissions) fall within the EFTA if made pursuant to a 
prearranged plan or agreement that is entered into between the consumer and the financial 
institution making the transfer and that contemplates periodic or recurring transfers. If an 
effective agreement exists, a transfer that the consumer initiates by telephone falls within the 
EFTA, even though an employee of the bank completes the transfer, or the consumer 
initiates the transfer through a facsimile machine, or the consumer initiates the transfer 
through the bank’s audio- or voice-response telephone system.  
 
Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment 
Electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) involves the presentment of bills from one 
or more sellers of goods, or providers of services, to a consumer through electronic means 
and the payment of that bill by the consumer, also through electronic means. Some experts 
expect EBPP to become one of the fastest growing applications of electronic fund transfers. 
 
Check and Credit Card Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1038                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
At present, EBPP systems vary in organization and complexity. They may involve a 
transaction between a single merchant and a customer, or the consolidation of multiple bills 
from different billers or of multiple payments from different customers. Initially, EBPP 
systems were offered by proprietary providers. More recently, however, banks have begun to 
enter the field, often by contracting out implementation of the system to proprietary 
providers. Banks may have an advantage in marketing these systems because consumers who 
are likely to use these systems often have existing relationships with their banks. Bank 
customers, therefore, may be more willing to trust those institutions to handle their accounts 
than to entrust funds to a new entity with whom they have no previous or tangible 
relationship. 
 
Biller Direct Systems 
Existing EBPP systems usually fall within one of two categories: biller direct systems and 
consolidation/aggregations systems. In a biller direct system, merchants deal with each 
customer individually. In a typical transaction, the customer will enter an Internet site that 
the biller has created. There, the customer who wishes to pay his telephone bill online will 
simply log on to the telephone company’s web site, enter a username and password that 
allows the customer to pull up a copy of his bill, review it, and instruct the biller to obtain 
payment from the customer’s bank account. Prior to this time, the customer will have 
entered into an agreement with the biller to receive and to pay his bills electronically. The 
customer will have created the username and password (which qualifies as an access device 
under EFTA) and will have provided the biller with information about the customer and the 
customer’s account at the financial institut ion from which the biller may collect payment. 
Typically, this will include the customer’s e-mail address, the routing number of the 
customer’s bank, and the customer’s account number at the bank. In some systems, the 
biller will send an e-mail to the customer indicating that a bill is outstanding and directing 
the customer to the biller’s website. 
 
After the customer views the information posted by the biller, the customer may approve 
the information and authorize payment. The biller will then initiate payment by contacting a 
payment provider that has agreed to collect payments on behalf of the biller. The payment 
provider will contact the financial institution that holds the customer’s account and request 
the institution to debit the customer’s a ccount and remit the proceeds to the payment 
provider. The payment provider will then credit the proceeds, minus any fees, to the biller. 
These payments may be transferred through an ACH transfer or through a paper transfer 
Financial Transactions  Check and Credit Card Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1039 
such as a cashier’s check when the recipient is not able to receive payments in an electronic 
form.  
 
Person to Person (P2P) Payment Systems 
Personal online payment systems, often called P2P or person-to-person payment systems, 
have become popular ways for making relatively small payments between individuals or 
between an individual and a business. These payments have become popular in the online 
auction market, where winning bids may be too small to justify the use of a credit card or the 
seller is an individual who does not accept credit card payments. In 2002, eBay, the online 
auction site, acquired PayPal, the dominant provider of P2P services. PayPal currently has 
more than 164 million accounts worldwide, and is available in 190 markets and 17 different 
currencies. The success of proprietary systems like PayPal has induced conventional banks to 
consider entering the P2P arena. Many banks have begun to offer similar services. 
 
One restriction of most current P2P systems is that they will only complete transfers to 
persons who are also subscribers to the service. While this restriction may help a system to 
gain a customer base and reduce fraud by obtaining information about recipients, it also 
limits the scope of potential users.  
 
A Model of P2P: PayPal 
There is a significant opportunity for change and growth in implementation since P2P 
systems are still in their beginning stages. PayPal is dominant in the market at this point, so 
we will use it as the model of the P2P system for illustrative purposes. Potential users of the 
system must log in to the provider’s websi te and submit registration information including 
their name, mailing and e-mail addresses, and phone number. An e-mail is sent from PayPal 
to the user’s provided e-mail address with the user’s password. Before initiating any 
transfers, the user must send that password from the e-mail account that the user indicated 
at the time of registration. This permits the provider to verify information about the user 
and reduce the probability that the user is engaged in fraudulent activity or has established an 
account in the name of a fictitious person.  
 
In order to make a payment, the user enters his username and password along with the e-
 mail address and payment information for the recipient. Users may authorize the provider to 
withdraw funds from any of three sources. First, the user may maintain an account directly 
with the provider. The user may authorize the provider to withdraw funds from the user’s 
account at another financial institution. If the user registers his bank account as a source of 
Check and Credit Card Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1040                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
payment, the provider will verify the user’s control of the account by making two small 
deposits to the account in an undisclosed amount and requiring the user to confirm the 
amount of the deposits. Third, the user may authorize the provider to charge his credit card 
with the amount of the payment.  
 
Transfers initiated by the user from his account registered with the provider will constitute 
electronic fund transfers. This is true even if the provider is not a bank. (Proprietary 
providers such as PayPal probably do not qualify as “banks” because they do not make 
loans. They may, however, qualify as money transmitters and may require state licenses for 
that purpose.) The EFTA defines an electronic fund transfer as a transfer of funds “initiated 
through an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer so as to order a 
financial institution to debit or credit an account.” But a “financial institution” is defined 
with sufficient breadth to include institutions that do not qualify as banks. A “financial 
institution” for purposes of EFTA is “any person who, directly, or indirectly, holds an 
account belonging to a consumer,” and an “account” is any “asset account established 
primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.” Therefore, electronic transfers 
initiated by a consumer to transfer funds from an asset account held by a proprietary P2P 
provider would be governed by EFTA and Regulation E.  
 
Types of Fraud 
There are several ways in which fraud may be perpetrated through EBPP and P2P systems 
since passwords that allow access into customer bank accounts must be made available to 
third parties. Also, bills that contain significant information about customers must be passed 
through multiple parties. Potential sources of fraud include the following: 
• A biller may send a bill for services not rendered or for goods never sent. 
• A person who has obtained information about another person’s bank account may  
instruct a biller to obtain payment from the other person’s account. 
• A hacker could obtain passwords and usernames from an aggregator and use that  
information to direct transfers from a consumer’s bank account. 
• An employee at the site providing EBPP services that has been provided a consumer’s 
usernames and passwords for screen scraping purposes could use that information to 
direct transfers from the consumer’s bank account. 
• A bank employee may use customer information to direct transfers from a  
customer’s account. 
 
Financial Transactions  Check and Credit Card Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1041 
Unfortunately, the financial institution that offers electronic fund transfers to its customers 
will have difficulty determining the source of any leak of customer information necessary to 
initiate a transfer. Therefore, in order to maintain good relations with its customer and to 
avoid further liability, a bank may accept responsibility for them. Thus, the best strategy for 
the bank will be to take measures that reduce the probability that fraud will materialize in the 
first place.  
 
Detection and Deterrence of Electronic Transfer Fraud 
Considering the limited capacity of banks to shift losses from unauthorized electronic fund 
transfers to their customers, banks should make efforts to minimize the incidence of fraud. 
The very justification for limiting consumer liability may be that banks are in a superior 
position to learn of and counteract fraudulent schemes that are employed to effect 
unauthorized transactions. Banks can take certain initiatives to secure access devices and 
computers from interference. Banks can also follow “know your customer” rules in order to 
prevent the issuance of access devices to individuals who are likely to use them fraudulently.  
 
The following sections provide specific safeguards that banks can perform to reduce the risk 
that they or their customers can become victimized by unauthorized electronic fund 
transfers. 
 
Issuance and Use of Access Devices 
Electronic fund transfer fraud often involves individuals who use information to obtain 
access to the accounts of others. As a result, bank personnel can prevent fraud by exercising 
care in the initial decision to allow an individual to access the bank’s computerized services. 
Banks offering EBPP or P2P systems to customers should: 
• Confirm phone and mailing addresses on the application to ensure that they are  
consistent with information about the applicant that is available from other sources and, 
with respect to existing customers, consistent with current records about these  
customers. This may involve obtaining credit reports about the applicant or obtaining 
copies of utility bills that show the applicant’s address. 
• Make sure that the area code on the applicant’s telephone number matches the  
geographical area for the applicant’s address. 
• Send a “welcome” letter to the address on the application with the bank’s return address 
so that the letter will be returned if the applicant is not living at that address. 
• Verify by telephone or additional mailings any change of address requests in the same 
way that you would verify a new account application. 
Check and Credit Card Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1042                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• If a customer reports the loss or theft of an access device, cancel the existing card, PIN, 
or other form of access and issue a new one. 
• If a customer reports that a person previously authorized to use access device reports no 
longer has that authority, cancel all cards, PINs, or other access devices and issue new 
ones to the customer. 
• Always mail PINs separately from other information, such as usernames, with which 
they are associated. 
• Separate the responsibility of bank employees who have custody of information relating 
to access devices from those who have responsibility for issuance, verification, or 
reissuance of PINs. 
• Ensure that any communication concerning usernames or passwords is sent in a secure 
encrypted format. 
• Customers who register for EBPP or P2P systems should be required to provide 
information indicating that they are authorized to use the bank account or credit card 
from which payments will be made. 
 
Use of ACH Network 
When non-customers of the bank are able to attain access to information about an actual 
customer, fraud may occur. To limit this possibility, banks should perform strict user 
authentication standards. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) requires 
banks within its jurisdiction to uphold a commercially reasonable method to authenticate the 
identity of a customer. Banks that use the ACH are also subject to National Automated 
Clearing House Association (NACHA) rules that require originating banks to take certain 
measures to ensure that the correct customer has authorized the transaction. 
 
NACHA has implemented specific rules for Internet-initiated entries. A specific standard 
entry class (SEC) code must be used for Internet-initiated entries. That code, WEB, must be 
used to identify an ACH debit entry to a consumer account that a receiver authorizes 
through the Internet. The rules apply to both single-entry and recurring debits and require 
ODFIs that transmit WEB entries to warrant that their originators have complied with 
certain standards that protect the security of the ACH network and consumer financial 
information. 
Originators of WEB entries are required to: 
• Obtain consumer authorization prior to initiating a WEB entry. The authorization must 
provide evidence of the consumer’s identity and asset to the authorization. 
• Employ commercially reasonable fraudulent transaction detection systems to screen 
Financial Transactions  Check and Credit Card Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1043 
entries in order to maintain the risk of fraud. Different transactions may require different 
levels of authentication, depending on the risk level of the transaction. 
• Use commercially reasonable fraudulent transaction detection systems to screen entries 
in order to minimize the risk of fraud. Different transactions may require different levels 
of authentication, depending on the risk level of the transaction. 
• Establish a secure Internet session with each customer using a commercially reasonable 
security technology. That session must be in place from the time consumers enter their 
banking information through the time of the transmission to the originator, including 
any transmission to a service provider such as an aggregator. 
• Conduct an annual security audit to ensure that financial information obtained from 
consumers is protected by security practices and procedures that include adequate levels 
of (1) physical security to protect against theft, tampering, or damage; (2) personnel and 
access controls to protect against unauthorized access and use; and (3) network security 
to ensure capture, storage, and distribution of financial information. 
 
Operation of Payment Systems 
Banks that participate in EBPP or P2P systems can take steps to detect fraudulent 
transactions, either by providing information to customers or by analyzing transactions that 
have characteristics associated with fraud. These measures include the following: 
• Send customers e-mail alerts when a new bill arrives or a payment is sent. The e-mail 
should advise the customer to contact the bank immediately if the bill was not expected 
or the payment was not authorized. 
• Refuse or scrutinize any transactions from a payer or recipient who has been the subject 
of a notice from a credit card issuer indicating that the person was involved in an 
unauthorized credit card transaction or unauthorized transfer to or from a bank account. 
• Ensure that the name on the bank account associated with the P2P account matches the 
name on the P2P account itself. 
• Track and verify payments of similar amounts to the same recipient. 
• Since P2P systems are frequently used to make payments for online activities, be aware 
of activities that are typically associated with fraud and scrutinize transactions with 
customers who engage in such activities. These activities include pyramid schemes, 
online auctions, and sale of items that have a delayed delivery date. 
 
Protection of Internet Addresses 
Banks or their customers may become victims of fraud, especially identity theft, if they do 
not carefully monitor the use of their name on the Internet. Fraudulent actors may create 
Check and Credit Card Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1044                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
false domain names to attract the bank’s customers and get them to provide information that 
will then be used for illicit purposes. This activity, known as cybercloning, involves the creation 
of a “spoof” site, complete with a domain name close to the domain name of a legitimate 
bank and containing the real bank’s logo. An e-mail may be sent asking customers and 
potential customers to log on to the false domain name. Those who respond may be asked 
for information such as account numbers and credit card numbers. Alternately, individuals 
may register domain names close to the domain name of actual banks and use those sites to 
market goods or services with which the bank would not want to be associated. For instance, 
Citigroup had a battle with an individual who registered the name citicard.com and directed 
users who logged in to this site to an online gambling site.  
 
Prevention of EFT Fraud in Other Companies 
The Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) recommends several 
steps for prevention of EFT fraud in companies. The following is a brief overview: 
• Define the EFT process and controls points  
• Define EFT policies and procedures 
• Ensure physical security surrounding all EFT components 
• Implement effective EFT application security 
• Implement effective network operating system security 
• Implement effective security surrounding EFT data 
• Implement effective system logging that establishes a baseline that can be used to 
measure unusual activity. 
• Conduct reconciliations to allow for the determination of whether data have been 
modified during any stage of the EFT process.
