International Anti-Money Laundering Efforts 
In the 1980s, the mounting global drug crisis led to the birth of international anti-money 
laundering (AML) efforts. As a result, international organizations began taking on initiatives 
to fight money laundering while others were created for that same purpose. The principal 
organizations include the United Nations (UN), the Financial Action Task Force on Money 
Laundering (FATF), and the Egmont Group. Fo llowing the events of September 11, 2001, 
however, the international community’s AML focus shifted from anti-drugs to anti-terrorism 
and many international organizations revised the AML framework to not only examine 
funds from illegal sources but to also examine funds whose purposes were illegitimate. 
 
The United Nations 
In 1988, the UN adopted the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and 
Psychotropic Substances, a mandate to bring an end to money laundering. In response, the 
UN established the Global Programme against Money-Laundering (GPML), which provides 
member states with assistance in complying with international AML standards. In addition, 
the GPML, in participation with other international organizations, maintains the 
International Money Laundering Information Ne twork (IMoLIN), a website that provides 
the international community with information and tools concerning AML.   
 
The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) 
In 1989, the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial nations established the Financial 
Action Task Force (FATF), a multilateral policy-making and standard-setting body designed 
to combat money laundering. The FATF developed a set of Forty Recommendations 
regarding the proper approach to combat money laundering through law enforcement

efforts, financial regulations, and international cooperation. In addition to observing the 
current FATF members carrying out these recommendations, the FATF also lobbies for 
other nations and territories to adopt them. The FATF also issues financial advisories that 
warn financial institutions against doing business in countries that seem to invite  
money laundering. 
 
The Egmont Group 
The Egmont Group is an informal international network of financial intelligence units 
(FIUs), national centers that collect information on suspicious or unusual financial activity, 
designed to fight money laundering by encouraging global cooperation and mutual exchange 
of information.
