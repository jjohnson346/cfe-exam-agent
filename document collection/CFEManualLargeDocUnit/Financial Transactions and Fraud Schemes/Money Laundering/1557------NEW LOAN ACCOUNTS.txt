NEW LOAN ACCOUNTS 
An institution should perform due diligence in establishing a new loan account because if the 
customer is engaged in money laundering, there is a risk of forfeiture of collateral pledged on 
the loans. Real or personal property that is traceable to drug sales or that is purchased with 
laundered funds is subject to seizure by the government. If the property seized is pledged as 
collateral, the financial institution must prove that it was an innocent lienholder of the 
property and had no knowledge of the illegal activity. 
 
Minimum standards regarding the information to be gathered should include: 
• Reliable identifying information similar to that required for new deposit accounts. 
• Reliable financial information such as financial statements, W-2s, and copies of tax 
returns. 
• The purpose of the loan. 
• Credit history and prior banking references. 
• Verifiable, legitimate means of repayment.

• Assurance that the loan amount is consistent with the purpose of the loan and the nature 
of the business.
