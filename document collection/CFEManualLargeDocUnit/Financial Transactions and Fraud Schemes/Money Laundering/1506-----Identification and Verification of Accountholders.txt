Identification and Verification of Accountholders 
Section 326 of the Act expands the Bank Secrecy Act (discussed below) by requiring 
financial institutions to implement Customer Identification Programs (CIPs). These CIPs are 
to be incorporated into financial institutions’ money laundering programs, and at a 
minimum, they must include reasonable procedures for: 
• Verifying the identity of any person seeking to open an account to the extent reasonable 
and practicable;  
• Maintaining records of the information used to verify a person’s identity, including 
name, address, and other identifying information; and  
• Consulting lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations to determine 
if the person seeking to open the account appears on any such list.
