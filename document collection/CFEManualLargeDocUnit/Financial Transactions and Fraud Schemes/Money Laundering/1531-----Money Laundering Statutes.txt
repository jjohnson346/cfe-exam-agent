Money Laundering Statutes, Title 18, U.S.C., § 1956 and §  1957 
TRANSACTIONAL MONEY LAUNDERING 
Section 1956(a)(1) provides that anyone who knows that property involved in a  
financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and conducts a 
financial transaction in any of the following ways:  
• With the intent to promote the carrying on of “specified unlawful activity” 
• With the intent to violate section 7201 (tax evasion) or 7206 (filing false return) of the 
Internal Revenue Code 
• Knowing that the transaction is designed to  conceal or disguise the nature, location, 
source, ownership, or control of the illegal proceeds 
• Knowing that the transaction is designed to avoid a reporting requirement 
 
Such individuals shall be fined up to $500,000 or twice the value of the monetary instrument 
or funds (whichever is greater) and/or imprisoned for not more than 20 years. “Specified 
unlawful activity” is defined in § 1956(c)(7) and includes a long list of federal crimes 
including RICO, fraud, embezzlement, theft, and false statements. Also, funds that are 
illegally transmitted in violation of this statute or any property traceable to those funds are 
subject to civil forfeiture under 18, U.S.C., § 981(a)(1)(A). 
 
INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORTATION AND LAUNDERING OF FUNDS 
Section 1956(a)(2) prohibits the transportation, transmission, or transfer of funds either into 
or out of the United States if the person knows the funds are the proceeds of unlawful 
activity and the transportation, transmission, or transfer is done with the intent to promote 
the carrying on of “specified unlawful conduct”; is done to conceal the nature, location, 
source, ownership, or control of the funds; or  is done to avoid reporting requirements. The 
penalties are the same as those set forth in subsection (a)(1). 
 
STING OPERATIONS 
Section 1956(a)(3) prohibits a person from engaging in financial transactions involving 
property the person believes  to be the proceeds of illegal activity. This is intended to cover 
“sting” operations in which a suspect engages in money laundering activity with funds he

believes to be illegally derived, even though the funds are actually supplied by government 
agents. The person can be imprisoned for up to 20 years and/or fined in accordance with 18, U.S.C., § 3571. 
 
ENGAGING IN MONETARY TRANSACTIONS WITH MONEY DERIVED FROM SPECIFIED UNLAWFUL ACTIVITY 
An offense occurs under section 1957 if a person knowingly engages or attempts to engage 
in a monetary transaction with criminally derived property that is greater than $10,000 and 
that is derived from “specified unlawful activity.” Section 1957 applies in situations where 
the offense takes place in the United States (or within its special maritime or territorial 
jurisdiction) or the offense takes place outside the U.S., but the defendant is a U.S. citizen or 
legal alien. 
 
Violations of this statute are punishable by a fine under 18, U.S.C., § 3571 and/or 10 years in 
prison. In addition, the illegally transmitted funds can be forfeited under 18, U.S.C., § 
981(a)(1)(A). 
 
CIVIL PENALTIES  
Section 1956(b) sets forth civil penalties for violations of sections 1956 and 1957. Under this 
section, those who violate either money laundering statute are liable to the United States for 
the value of the property, funds, or monetary instruments involved in the illegal transaction, 
or $10,000, whichever is greater.  
 
LONG-ARM JURISDICTION OVER FOREIGN MONEY LAUNDERERS 
Section 1956(b) also gives U.S. district courts jurisdiction over foreign persons or financial 
institutions when (1) the foreign person commits a money laundering offense under section 
1956(a) that occurs in whole or in part in the United States; (2) the foreign person converts 
to his own use property in which the United States has an ownership interest; or (3) the 
foreign financial institution maintains a bank account in the United States.  
 
Under section 1956(b)(3), a U.S. court can issue restraining orders to freeze the assets of 
foreign money launderers described above prior to trial to ensure that the defendant’s assets 
are available to satisfy a judgment. The court can also appoint a Federal Receiver to collect, 
marshal, and take control of the defendant’s assets to satisfy a civil or criminal judgment for 
money laundering, or a civil or criminal forfeiture judgment.
