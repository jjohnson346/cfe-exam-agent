ENGAGING IN MONETARY TRANSACTIONS WITH MONEY DERIVED FROM SPECIFIED UNLAWFUL ACTIVITY 
An offense occurs under section 1957 if a person knowingly engages or attempts to engage 
in a monetary transaction with criminally derived property that is greater than $10,000 and 
that is derived from “specified unlawful activity.” Section 1957 applies in situations where 
the offense takes place in the United States (or within its special maritime or territorial 
jurisdiction) or the offense takes place outside the U.S., but the defendant is a U.S. citizen or 
legal alien. 
 
Violations of this statute are punishable by a fine under 18, U.S.C., § 3571 and/or 10 years in 
prison. In addition, the illegally transmitted funds can be forfeited under 18, U.S.C., § 
981(a)(1)(A).
