Shell Companies 
Shell companies refer to non-publicly traded corporations, limited liability companies 
(LLCs), and trusts, which generally do not have any physical presence, other than a mailing 
address, and generate little to no independent economic value. In most situations, individuals 
and businesses form shell companies for legitimate reasons, such as holding the stock or 
intellectual property rights of another business entity, facilitating domestic and cross-border 
currency and asset transfers, or fostering domestic and cross-border currency corporate 
mergers. However, shell companies have become common tools for money laundering 
primarily because they have the ability to hide ownership and mask financial details and 
because money launderers can create them with minimal public disclosure of personal 
information regarding controlling interests and ownership. This lack of transparency 
prevents the discovery of suspicious transactions and impedes investigations and 
prosecutions.
