The Real Estate Industry 
Money launderers often use the real estate industry to launder illicitly obtained money. 
Generally, the real estate industry is attractive to money launderers for various reasons. For 
example, the vast array of financial transactions linked to real estate provides money 
launderers an exceptional range of options for abusing these procedures to launder and use 
illegally obtained funds. In addition, real estate transactions often involve multiple parties 
(such as brokers, agents, and appraisers), which can obscure the source of investment funds 
and the identity of the true owner. Finally, money launderers may earn additional profits 
from introducing illicit funds into the real estate industry, especially in vibrant real  
estate markets.   
 
Although there is a vast number of methods to launder money in the real estate industry, 
there are a few common schemes that warrant identification and discussion, including: 
• Loan-back schemes 
• Back-to-back loan schemes 
• Shell companies 
• Appraisal fraud

• Monetary instruments 
• Mortgage schemes 
• Indirect investments in the real estate industry 
 
LOAN-BACK SCHEMES 
Money launderers often use loan-back schemes to finance the purchase of properties directly 
or indirectly through purchasing shares in property investment funds. In a typical loan-back 
scheme, money launderers will deposit illicit funds in an overseas entity that they own and 
then the entity loans the funds back to the launderers. The purpose of the loan is to make 
the money source appear legitimate and to conceal the parties’ identities or the nature of the 
financial transactions associated with the loans.  
 
BACK-TO-BACK LOAN SCHEMES 
As with loan-back schemes, money launderers often use back-to-back loan schemes to 
purchase property. In a back-to-back loan scheme, a money launderer obtains a loan by 
presenting collateral, which originated from illicit funds, to a financial institution. Like the 
loan-back scheme, this technique gives the loaned money the appearance of a genuine loan.  
 
SHELL COMPANIES 
Money launderers often use shell companies, which are discussed in more detail below, to 
purchase real estate. Generally defined, shell companies are business entities, including 
limited liability companies, trusts, business trusts, and corporations, without active business 
or significant assets. Because there is a lack of transparency in the formation of shell 
companies, money launderers often use them to hide the identity of the true owner, the 
source of the money, or the destination of the money. 
 
APPRAISAL FRAUD 
Appraisal fraud is often associated with money laundering schemes. Money launderers may 
purchase properties to launder money or may use illicit funds to service the interest on the 
debts. Such schemes can conceal the true identity of the property owners and the true origin 
of the funds used in the transaction.  
 
Appraisal fraud occurs where appraisers fail to accurately evaluate the property, or when the 
appraiser deliberately becomes party to a scheme to defraud the lender, the borrower, or 
both. A common technique is the over- or under-valuation of property, which consists of 
buying/selling property at a price above/below its market value. In addition to manipulating

1.1608                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
appraisals, money launderers also over-value property through a series of subsequent sales, 
each time at a higher price, which tend to conceal the true purposes of the transactions. 
 
MONETARY INSTRUMENTS 
In many instances, money launderers purchase, build, or renovate property with cash, wire 
transfers, or other payable-through accounts. This allows the integration of large sums of 
illicit money into legal financial systems. Later, if sold, it is difficult to relate the transaction 
to any criminal activity and therefore, successfully conceals the true origin of the illicit funds 
and their ownership.   
 
MORTGAGE SCHEMES 
Often, money launderers will use illicit funds to pay the interest or repay the principal on 
mortgage loans, and in so doing, the illicit income is converted into seemingly legitimate 
profits when the property is sold. Mortgage schemes also involve under- and over-valuation 
of property. For example, in a common under-valuation scheme, a money launderer will 
under-value the purchase price of property, obtain a mortgage loan for the under-valued 
amount, use the loan to pay for the under-valued price, and pay the excess amount under the 
table with illicit funds.  
 
INDIRECT INVESTMENTS IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY 
Indirect investments, which are those in which the investor has no direct control over the 
assets or investment vehicle, in the real estate industry offer opportunities to conceal an 
investor’s identification and monetary sources primarily because multiple parties are involved 
with the process.
