Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)   
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
The BSA also requires financial institutions to monitor suspicious activity and file suspicious 
activity reports (SARs) to disclose known or suspected criminal offenses or transactions that 
involve money laundering or violate the Act. For years, suspicious transactions were 
reported on the Currency Transaction Report (CTR). However, such activity is now reported 
using the Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). 
 
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which charters, regulates, and 
supervises more than 2,500 national banks, adopted a requirement mandating that national 
banks file SARs with the appropriate federal law enforcement agencies and the Treasury 
Financial Transactions  Money Laundering 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1627 
Department, in accordance with the form’s instructions, by sending the reports to the 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). These reporting requirements are found 
in Title 12, Part 353 of the Code of Federal Regulations. This is an enormous improvement 
on the old reporting systems because it establishes a centralized reporting system that is 
shared throughout government agencies simultaneously. The DEA, for instance, can now 
access the same information as the IRS when working on a suspicious report. The reporting 
procedure has also been simplified for banks, making the information much easier for the 
Department of the Treasury to obtain.  
 
Financial institutions are also required to use SAR forms to report incidents of computer 
intrusion. The term “computer intrusion” is defined as gaining access to the computer 
system to remove, steal, or procure customers’  funds or other account information, or to 
access the institution’s computer system with the intention of damaging or disabling any 
critical computer systems. 
 
SARs are used to report a known or suspected criminal offense or a transaction that involves 
money laundering or violates the BSA. More specifically, a SAR must be filed with FinCEN 
in each of the following instances: 
• Any known or suspected criminal violation involving the financial institution when the 
institution has a substantial basis for identifying one of its directors, officers, employees, 
agents, or affiliated parties as having committed the act or aided in its commission. 
• Any known or suspected criminal violation involving the financial institution and 
aggregating $5,000 or more when the institution has a substantial basis for identifying a 
possible suspect or group of suspects. 
• Any known or suspected criminal violation involving the financial institution and 
aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of whether the institution has a substantial basis 
for identifying possible suspects. 
• Any transaction conducted or attempted to be conducted through the financial 
institution when the institution has reason to suspect that (1) the funds were derived 
from illegal activities, (2) the transaction is designed to evade any regulations under the 
Bank Secrecy Act, or (3) the transaction appears to have no business purposes or appears 
unusual in normal banking practice. 
 
When a financial institution reports a suspicious transaction to a government agency, the Act 
(18, U.S.C., § 5318(g)(2)) makes it illegal for the financial institution to notify any person 
involved in the suspicious transaction that such a report has been made.  
Money Laundering  Financial Transactions   
1.1628                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Section 5318(g)(3) of the BSA also contains a safe harbor provision for financial institutions 
that report suspicious transactions or that make voluntary disclosures to a government 
agency of any other possible violation of a law or regulation. The Act provides that these 
financial institutions shall not be liable under any law, regulation, or contract to any person 
for making the report. Note that this safe harbor provision only applies to reports made to 
government agencies, not to self-regulatory organizations.  
 
A copy of the SAR report form is included at the end of this chapter. 
 
MONEY SERVICES BUSINESSES 
Even before the passage of the PATRIOT Act, the Treasury Department was in the process 
of expanding its reporting guidelines to include businesses that did not fall under the 
traditional definition of financial institutions but nevertheless perform a myriad of financial 
services. One of these categories included money services businesses (MSBs), which comprise 
various types of money transmitters, issuers of money orders and traveler’s checks, and 
check cashing businesses. MSBs have long been  required to file CTRs, but otherwise very 
little government regulation has been required.  
 
In August 1999, many of the reporting and registration obligations contained in the Bank 
Secrecy Act were extended to MS Bs. These businesses are now required to register with 
FinCEN under Chapter 31, C.F.R. part 103, subchapter D. Those that fail to register can 
incur substantial penalties.  
 
Under the rules (1) money transmitters, (2) issuers, sellers, and redeemers of money orders, 
(3) issuers, sellers, and redeemers of traveler’s checks, and (4) the U.S. Postal Service (except 
with regard to the sale of postage or philatelic products) are required to report certain classes 
of transactions that meet certain dollar thresholds to the Department of the Treasury after 
January 1, 2002.  
 
The reportable transactions include: 
• Transactions involving funds derived from illegal activity or intended or conducted in 
order to hide or disguise funds or assets derived from illegal activity; 
• Transactions designed, whether through structuring or other means, to evade the 
requirements of the BSA;  
• Transactions that appear to serve no business or apparent lawful purpose; and 
• Transactions that involve the use of a mutual fund to facilitate criminal activity. 
Financial Transactions  Money Laundering 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1629 
The rule includes two different dollar thresholds depending on the stage and type of 
transaction involved: 
• For transactions conducted or attempted by, at, or through a money service business or 
its agent, a threshold of $2,000 applies; 
• For transactions identified by issuers of money orders or traveler’s checks from a review 
of clearance records or other similar records of instruments that have been sold or 
processed, a threshold of $5,000 applies. 
 
MSBs are given 30 days after becoming aware of a suspicious transaction to complete a 
Suspicious Activity Report by Money Services  Business (SAR-MSB; Form 109) and file it 
with FinCEN; in situations involving violations that require immediate attention, such as 
ongoing money laundering schemes, the MSB or MSBs are to notify the appropriate law 
enforcement authority immediately, by telephone, in addition to filing the required form. 
Supporting documentation relating to each SAR-MSB is to be collected and maintained by 
the reporting MSB for review as needed by law enforcement and regulatory agencies. 
Although the SAR-MSB form is not formatted for joint filing, MSBs may be included as 
joint filers with other reporting financial institutions. 
 
CURRENCY EXCHANGES 
In a rule issued February 10, 2003, U.S. currency exchanges are required to file Suspicious 
Activity Reports under the same rule that applies to money services businesses. 
 
MUTUAL FUNDS 
As part of the PATRIOT Act, mutual funds are also required to establish anti-money 
laundering programs. In May 2003, the Department of Treasury and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a regulation requiring mutual funds to implement 
“reasonable measures” to establish customer identification procedures and to verify whether 
customers appear on lists of any known or suspected terrorists.  
 
In May 2006, the Treasury Department issued fi nal approval to regulations that require 
mutual funds to report suspicious activities to FinCEN. Under these regulations, mutual 
funds are required to report suspicious currency and non-currency transactions (or 
attempted transactions) of $5,000 or more. The report would be filed on the “SAR-SF” 
(Suspicious Activity for Securities and Futures Industries) Form 101.  
 
Money Laundering  Financial Transactions   
1.1630                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
The Rule states that four categories of transactions will require reporting. These are the same 
four categories that trigger reporting requirements for money service businesses and 
currency exchanges: 
• Transactions involving funds derived from criminal activity, or intended or conducted to 
hide or disguise funds from criminal activity; 
• Transactions designed to evade Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requirements; 
• Transactions appearing to serve no business or apparent lawful purpose; or 
• Transactions involving the use of the mutual fund to facilitate criminal activity. 
 
SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS 
In 2002, FinCEN announced a rule requiring brokers and dealers in securities to report 
suspicious activity via a Suspicious Activity Report by Securities and Futures Industries 
(SAR-SF; FinCEN Form 101). These firms are obligated to report suspicious transactions 
conducted or attempted by, at, or through a broker-dealer and involve or aggregate at least 
$5,000 in funds or assets. This requirement took effect December 31, 2002. 
 
Brokers and dealers in securities are required to report to FinCEN transactions that fall into 
one of the four categories below. Again, these categories are substantially similar to those 
that trigger reports by money service businesses and mutual funds (see above). 
• Transactions involving funds derived from illegal activity, or intended or conducted in 
order to hide or disguise funds derived from illegal activity; 
• Transactions designed, whether through structuring or other means, to evade the 
requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act; 
• Transactions that appear to serve no business or apparent lawful purpose or are not the 
sort of transactions in which the particular customer would be expected to engage, and 
for which the broker-dealer knows of no reasonable explanation after examining the 
available facts; or 
• Transactions that involve the use of the broker-dealer to facilitate criminal activity. 
 
Broker-dealers are also required to establish anti-money laundering programs that, among 
other things, are designed to detect suspicious transactions, under recently promulgated self-regulatory 
organization (SRO) rules. The SEC has the authority to examine broker-dealers 
for compliance with the rule, and it is expected that the SROs will also be reviewing 
compliance as part of the enforcement of their rules. 
 
A copy of SAR-SF is included at the end of the chapter.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1631 
CASINOS AND CARD CLUBS 
Effective March 25, 2003, casinos and card clubs with gross revenue over $1,000,000 must 
file suspicious activity reports on form SAR-C. Under the rule, casinos and card clubs must 
report suspicious activity if a transaction involves or aggregates at least $5,000 in funds and if 
it meets one of the four categories that generally trigger SARs. (See previous sections on 
Financial Institutions, Money Service Businesses, Mutual Funds, etc.) 
 
Some possible examples of suspicious activity, according to FinCEN, include: 
• Using wire transfers and cashier’s checks to deposit funds into casino accounts and using 
the money for little or no gaming activity before cashing out; and 
• Transferring chips to other individuals to cash out, or redeeming chips for casino checks 
that total “significantly more” than the amount deposited with “no apparent winnings to 
account for the excess amount.” 
 
Casinos are also required to file Currency Transaction Reports via FinCEN Form 102 or the 
Nevada state form (see above). 
 
INSURANCE COMPANIES 
Although insurance companies have always fallen under the definition of a “financial 
institution” under the BSA, the Treasury Department had never issued any rules pertaining 
to the industry. The PATRIOT Act, however, requires that all “financial institutions” 
establish anti-money laundering programs, and it gives the Secretary of the Treasury the 
discretion to determine which institutions would be required to file SARs. 
 
In November 2005, FinCEN published rules pertaining to insurance companies that sell 
certain types of insurance products. The rules apply only to companies that sell “covered 
products” that FinCEN deemed to be more at risk for money laundering activities than 
other types of insurance products. Companies that sell these covered products are required 
to file SARs and to implement anti-money laundering programs. The rules define “covered 
products” as any of the following: 
• A permanent life insurance policy (other than a group policy); 
• An annuity contract (other than a group annuity contract); or 
• Any other insurance product with cash value or investment features. 
 
Group insurance products, term life, property, casualty, health, and title insurance policies 
are not considered “covered products.” 
Money Laundering  Financial Transactions   
1.1632                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Also, insurance companies must report suspicious activities to FinCEN. FinCEN Form 
108—Suspicious Activity Report by Insurance Companies—has been proposed; however, 
until the Form is approved, insurance companies should use the Suspicious Activity 
Reporting Form used by the securities and futures industries (FinCEN Form 101) to report 
suspicious activities. 
 
DEALERS IN PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, OR JEWELS 
Persons who deal in jewels, precious metals, and precious stones are required to establish 
anti-money laundering programs. “Dealers” are defined as persons who have purchased at 
least $50,000 and  sold more than $50,000 worth of jewels, stones, or metals during the 
preceding year. Additionally, the person must also be in the business of selling significant 
amounts of such items; therefore, the rule wo uld not apply to occasional sellers or hobbyists. 
Dealers, however, are not required to file SARs. FinCEN is developing a set of final rules to 
address in more detail who is covered under the rule and what procedures will be required.
