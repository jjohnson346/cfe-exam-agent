LEGAL DOCUMENTS AND REGULATORY FILINGS 
Legal documents range from trade secrets to pe nding litigation to summaries of regulatory 
problems the company faces. Pending lawsuits often detail problems with the company’s 
products, services, or operations. 
 
Papers pertaining to mergers and acquisitions have obvious commercial value. The same 
goes for licensing and franchise agreements. Special management reports document myriad 
challenges the target faces. For example, a report may examine what is wrong with the 
company’s inventory control system or that the base of parts suppliers is inadequate.
