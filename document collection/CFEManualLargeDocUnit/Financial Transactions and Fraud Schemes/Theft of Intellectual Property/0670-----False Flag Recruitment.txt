False Flag Recruitment 
False flag recruitment is among the most common recruiting ploys. If a spy discovers that a 
subject has strong social or political feelings, he attempts to twist those feelings into an 
appeal to help the “cause.” The spy convinces the recruit that providing information will 
help save the environmental conditions in the Amazon, will further the interests of the 
recruit’s native country, or will provide some ot her worthwhile benefit. Of course, the actual 
intelligence product is used for corporate espionage, not to help the cause, but the recruit 
does not learn that until it’s too late. 
 
Another method that can be used to gain information from a recruit is romantic or sexual 
seduction. This is not as common as the use of social or political causes as a justification for 
misappropriating company secrets, but it does happen. The spy or an operative does not 
necessarily trade sexual favors for company secrets. Often all that is needed is for an 
operative of the opposite sex to show some interest in the subject.
