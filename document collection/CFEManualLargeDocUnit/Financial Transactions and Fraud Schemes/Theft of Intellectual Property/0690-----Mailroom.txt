Mailroom 
The mailroom is one of the corporate spy’s favorite places to snoop. A great deal of 
information can be obtained from the mailroom by making a simple phone call. The spy can 
learn where to ship and receive packages, how the target’s internal billing system works, 
where to locate employees of the target company, and even the company’s Federal Express 
account number. A spy can also walk into most mailrooms and, simply by acting like he is 
supposed to be there, walk away with cost center account numbers, telephone directories, 
copies of internal communications, and in some cases even correspondence and packages.
