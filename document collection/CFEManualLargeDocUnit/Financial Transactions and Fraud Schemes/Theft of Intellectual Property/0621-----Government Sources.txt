SEC FILINGS 
Publicly traded companies are required to make certain filings with the SEC. These 
documents can be extremely helpful to the spy seeking to build a financial profile on the 
target. Information such as annual and quarterly reports on publicly traded companies can be 
accessed for free through the SEC’s EDGAR system at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml. 
 
Through this avenue, the spy can obtain the target’s Form 10-K, which contains the 
company’s income statement and balance sheet, information on its debt structure, foreign 
ownership, properties owned, subsidiaries, industry descriptions, depreciation, dilution, and 
other key business information. If the target company has filed for bankruptcy, been the 
target of a shareholder lawsuit, or been sued for patent infringement, this may also show up 
in the 10-K. Most publicly traded companies must also file 10-Qs, which are statements of 
quarterly income, earnings per share, etc. Ot her forms that are available from the SEC

include proxy statements, which provide information on stockholder votes taken on key 
issues; and forms 13-D and 14-D, which indicate major movements in stock ownership that 
are pending. 
 
STATE CORPORATE FILINGS 
States require that companies that do business within their jurisdictions register each year 
with the state government, usually through the Secretary of State’s office. This requirement 
extends to all companies operating in the state, not just those that are publicly traded.  
 
Many Secretary of State websites have enhanced search capabilities for business 
organizations, including searching by entity name, and by name of the person listed as a 
registered agent, officer, or director of a corporation. This search capability allows an 
intelligence analyst to find all the companies within a state in which a person serves as an 
officer or as a director. A search can help the CI professional develop a family tree of the 
officer’s business interests. It becomes a useful tool for uncovering lesser-known or hidden 
connections between businesses. The financial strength of a targeted business often lies in its 
affiliates or subsidiaries, which rise to the surface in an officer/director search. 
 
INDUSTRIAL REPORTS AND STUDIES 
State and federal governments periodically issue industrial reports and studies on various 
industries ranging from appliance manufacturers to high technology companies. These 
studies provide statistical benchmarks useful to establish where a company stands in its 
industry. In addition, they help delineate the standards for evaluating successful companies 
in that industry. State industrial directories, special industry issues in magazines like Fortune 
and Forbes, and directories from trade associations serve the same function.
