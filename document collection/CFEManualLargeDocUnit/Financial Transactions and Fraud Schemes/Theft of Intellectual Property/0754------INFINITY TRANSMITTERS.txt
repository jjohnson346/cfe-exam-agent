INFINITY TRANSMITTERS 
Infinity transmitters are a special kind of device that can be activated from a remote location. 
Once an infinity transmitter has been inserted  in a phone, a spy can call that telephone from 
anywhere in the world and turn it into a listening device. Unknown to the parties present, 
the telephone becomes a hidden microphone.
