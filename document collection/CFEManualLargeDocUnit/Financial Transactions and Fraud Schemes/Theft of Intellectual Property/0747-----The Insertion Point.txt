The Insertion Point 
In identifying the insertion point, the spy not only has to choose an area where proprietary 
information is likely to be discussed or displayed on computer screens, but also where 
background noise and electronic interference remain minimal. Spies frequently choose areas 
with proximity to computers and telecommunications equipment carrying proprietary data as 
an insertion point.  
 
Spies may also target areas conducive to employee conversations. This can include any place, 
inside or outside the targeted company, where key personnel gather and chat. Examples

include smoking areas; recreational areas such as bars, lounges, and coffeehouses; employee 
cafeterias; relaxation areas; exercise rooms; and meeting rooms. To target particular 
operations such as information services, spies might wire the offices of key managers, which 
are likely to provide access to a large portion of human information flow.
