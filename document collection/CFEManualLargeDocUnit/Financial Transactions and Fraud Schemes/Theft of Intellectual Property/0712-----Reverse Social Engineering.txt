Reverse Social Engineering 
Reverse social engineering creates the impression in the target’s mind that the spy is 
someone who can help them. It is actually a form of false flag recruitment. The scam can be 
perpetrated by telephone, e-mail, or regular mail. In a typical scheme, the spy poses as a 
representative of some software company. He sends a message to the target indicating that a 
software product (Product X) that the target owns has a possible defect. The target is 
instructed to call the software company (the spy) with his user ID and password in order to 
receive the fix. When the target calls, the spy obtains his access codes and then pronounces 
that his edition of the product is okay. Now the spy has access to that software product (for 
instance, a sensitive database) to use at will.
