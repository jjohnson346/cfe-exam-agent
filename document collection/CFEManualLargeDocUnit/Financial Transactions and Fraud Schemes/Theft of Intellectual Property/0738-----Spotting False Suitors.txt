Spotting False Suitors 
A tactic sometimes utilized by business intelligence professionals is to initiate false 
negotiations for the purchase of services, product lines, or portions of the target company. 
During the course of the negotiations, the spy attempts to gain valuable information about 
the target, its cost structure, production schedule, manufacturing processes, etc. Other

similar tactics that have already been discussed include spies posing as headhunters, 
conducting false employment interviews to gather information, and posing as a potential 
customer through the use of bogus requests for proposal.  
 
Management and employees should be trained to spot these schemes. False inquiries by 
purchasers can be terminated quickly if organizations require interested parties to 
demonstrate financial qualifications before commencing with any high-level negotiations. 
Financial statements of the suitor should be verified. Similarly, before replying to any RFP, it 
goes without saying that an organization should verify the existence and interest of the 
company seeking proposals. This can be easily accomplished by simply looking up the 
company in the phone book or traveling to its physical address to verify that the company 
exists. A search of state and county records can also be conducted to determine if the 
company is legally registered. Another simple technique is to contact others in the relevant 
industry to see if they have heard of the suitor company. In cases where a spy is posing as a 
representative of an existing company, a phone call to this company to verify the 
information in the RFP will help ensure that the request is legitimate. If evidence suggests 
that the party or company is a false front, security can again take the opportunity to provide 
misleading information to the potential information thieves.  
 
If employees are approached by companies interested in hiring them, similar steps should be 
taken to ensure that these suitors are not actually corporate spies fishing for information. 
Employees should be trained to report suspicious offers by outsiders. Of course, it is 
unrealistic to expect employees to report every job offer they receive or every employment 
interview they take. What organizations can do is train their employees—particularly those in 
possession of key information—to be wary of the deception tactics spies use. It is a good 
idea to explain to key personnel how these schemes are generally initiated, and what 
information the spy will be trying to obtain. Hopefully, this will help employees spot phony 
suitors and report them before any meetings or bogus interviews are conducted. In the 
alternative, employees may at least be wary of suspicious questions during bogus interviews 
and know enough not to divulge sensitive information.  
 
In addition to training key employees to spot deception techniques, it may be advantageous 
to train these employees in some of the simple methods they can use to determine if a suitor 
is legitimate, such as verifying its phone number or address, contacting others in the 
industry, or simply calling the company’s number in the phone book (if one is listed) to 
verify the time of an interview. These are steps that employees can take without having to

tell their employer about outside job offers, and which might uncover a corporate espionage 
campaign.
