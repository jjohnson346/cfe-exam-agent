Security Measures for the Recruit 
Spies are instructed to not leave incriminating evidence at their home or at their company 
workspace. The goal is to eliminate any evidence trail that could lead back to them.

Furthermore, they do not want to give the target any indication that it is actually being 
infiltrated.  
 
Computer security measures for a spy can be of particular importance. Recruits are generally 
instructed not to save any documents — even for a short time — on a hard drive or external 
storage device without encryption. For added security, many corporate spies double-encrypt 
everything they steal with two different systems. The overriding goal is to leave no 
incriminating evidence of the intelligence campaign and to avoid detection at all costs. The 
longer the spy can continue his activities undetected, the more damage he can do.
