SATELLITE TRACKING SYSTEMS 
In most satellite tracking systems, a small transmitter is surreptitiously attached to the 
subject’s vehicle. Common hiding areas include the trunk, inside fenders, or under the rear 
bumper. The transmitter communicates with global positioning satellites (GPS) and converts 
the coordinates of the vehicle onto a map. The spy only needs access to the Internet and a 
password to enter a special, private home page where he can view maps that show the 
vehicle’s location and path. These systems are capable of generating event lists and plain-text 
histories of where the vehicle has traveled. A variation on this tracking design is that in some 
satellite tracking software the system creates a trail of electronic breadcrumbs on the map 
display. The map can be a powerful tool in tracking the movements of executives and key 
company employees.
