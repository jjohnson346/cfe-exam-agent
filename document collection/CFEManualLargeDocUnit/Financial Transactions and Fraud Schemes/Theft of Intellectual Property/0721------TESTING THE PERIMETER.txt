TESTING THE PERIMETER 
A security survey should begin at the perimeter of the organization. The security 
professional needs to visualize himself as a determined attacker. Do the alarm and video 
camera systems deter from entering the premises without authorization? How easy is it to 
bypass the access control systems? Can badges be obtained without much trouble through 
deception or theft? Are basic defenses (fences, lo cks, barriers, and security patrols) in place 
and in good repair?
