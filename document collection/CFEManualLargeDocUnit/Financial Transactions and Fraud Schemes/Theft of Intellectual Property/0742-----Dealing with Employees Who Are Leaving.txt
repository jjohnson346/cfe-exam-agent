Dealing with Employees Who Are Leaving 
Technical employees who give notice that they are leaving their jobs while working on highly 
sensitive projects should be transferred to non-sensitive projects until their termination date. 
All employees (as well as vendors, contractors, consultants, temporary help, etc.) should be 
required to sign nondisclosure agreements at the time of their hiring. When employees are 
leaving an organization, they should be reminded of their obligation to protect the 
organization’s secrets, even after their employment  ends. It is a good idea to have employees 
sign a statement at their exit interviews in which they affirm that they understand and will 
comply with the terms of the nondisclosure agreements they have signed.  
 
If reliable intelligence reveals that an employee intends to sell the organization’s proprietary 
information, placing misleading information in his hands may dilute some of the impact. 
Planting technical gossip in the company lunchroom, for example, may be an effective 
method for misinforming an employee.
