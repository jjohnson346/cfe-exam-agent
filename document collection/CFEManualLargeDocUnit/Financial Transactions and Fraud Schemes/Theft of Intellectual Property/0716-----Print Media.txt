Print Media 
Print sources should not consist of an unread mountain of journals on the manager’s desk. It 
is far more productive to subscribe to just a few professional publications that are read and 
indexed. Security Management, the National Asso ciation of Legal Investigators’ The Legal 
Investigator, and the Journal of Security Administration offer insight on the latest security 
and investigative trends. 
 
Local newspapers can provide an overview of general criminal activity relevant to the 
business, and area business journals are good sources for accounts of industrial espionage. 
The security team should also read employment ads for phony job interview schemes.
