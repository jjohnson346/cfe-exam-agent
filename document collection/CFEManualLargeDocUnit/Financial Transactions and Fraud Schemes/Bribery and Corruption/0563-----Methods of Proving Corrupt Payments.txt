Methods of Proving Corrupt Payments 
There are three basic ways to prove illegal payments: identify and trace them by audit steps, 
turn an inside witness, or secretly infiltrate or record ongoing transactions. An audit might 
focus on the point of suspected payment or receipt, or both. As a very general proposition, 
suspected on-book schemes are best approached from the point of payment, and off-book 
schemes are most easily identified at the suspected point of receipt, or through the use of an 
inside witness, or surveillance.
