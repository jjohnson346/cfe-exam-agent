Sources of Information for the Business Profile 
PRINCIPALS, EMPLOYEES, AND RECORDS OF SUSPECT BUSINESS 
People suspected of making illegal payments might submit to an interview, particularly if 
they are confident that the payments are well hidden. Interviews should also include other 
key employees (including the financial personnel) involved in the suspect transactions, 
particularly those who have since left the company. Use the Business Profile as a guide to 
questioning.  
 
CUSTOMERS AND COMPETITORS 
In a kickback case, the “customer” (agency) is the employer of the person taking payoffs, 
and is also the victim of the crime. Customers and competitors can provide valuable 
information about the payer’s business operation, particularly concerning the payer’s regular 
bank account, which can be identified through canceled checks. The customer might also 
have invoices and shipping documents that might lead to off-book funds. 
 
BANKS AND LENDING INSTITUTIONS 
The business’s banker might have credit applications, financial statements, loan files, and 
bank account information that might help the examiner. 
 
BUSINESS REPORTING COMPANIES 
Dun & Bradstreet and other commercial reporting companies disseminate basic information 
about the size, structure, sales, and employees of the business. Information about larger 
companies is found in Standard & Poors and other business directories. Other information 
on public record information is located in the “Sources of Information” chapter in the 
Investigation section of the Fraud Examiners  Manual.
