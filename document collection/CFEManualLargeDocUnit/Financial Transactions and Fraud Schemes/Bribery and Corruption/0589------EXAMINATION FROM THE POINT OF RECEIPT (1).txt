EXAMINATION FROM THE POINT OF RECEIPT 
Often, the only practical approach to identifying and tracing illegal payments is to focus on 
the suspected recipient, particularly if the person making the payments is unknown, one 
person is suspected of taking from many, the payments are in cash or from off-book funds, 
and so on. 
 
THE FINANCIAL/BEHAVIORAL PROFILE 
The Financial/Behavioral Profile is outlined in the “Tracing Illicit Transactions” chapter in 
the Investigation section of the Fraud Examiners Manual. The Financial Profile will identify 
most illicit funds deposited to accounts or expended in significant amounts. It will not reveal 
relatively small currency transactions, particularly if they were for concealed activities, 
consumables, or unusual one-time expenses, such as medical bills. The Financial Profile 
might give inaccurate or false negative readings unless such activities are identified. This is 
done through preparation of the Behavioral Profile. During the interview be alert and review 
documents for signs that the target has: 
• A drug and/or alcohol addiction 
• A gambling habit 
• Loan shark or other private debts 
• A girlfriend (or boyfriend) supported by the target 
• Extraordinary medical expenses 
• Significant, regular cash expenses for entertainment and/or travel 
 
The Behavioral Profile might also provide evidence of a possible motive of the crime, such 
as large debts, as well as additional evidence of illicit funds. For example, if the suspect spent 
significant amounts of cash, and had no corresponding cash withdrawals from disclosed 
bank accounts or no admitted sources of cash income, there must be other, undisclosed 
sources of income.
