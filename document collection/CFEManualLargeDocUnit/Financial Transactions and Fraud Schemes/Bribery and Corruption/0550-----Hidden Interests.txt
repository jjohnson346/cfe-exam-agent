Hidden Interests 
In the latter stages of sophisticated schemes, the payer might give a hidden interest in a joint 
venture or other profit-making enterprise. The recipient’s interest might be concealed 
through a straw nominee, hidden in a trust or other business entity, or merely included by an 
undocumented verbal agreement. Such arrangements are very difficult to detect, and even if 
identified, proof of corrupt intent might be difficult to demonstrate.
