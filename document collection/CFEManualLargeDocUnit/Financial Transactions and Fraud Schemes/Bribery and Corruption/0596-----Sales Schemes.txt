Sales Schemes 
There are two principal types of conflict schemes associated with sales of goods or services 
by the victim company. The first and most harmful is the underselling of goods or services. 
Just as a corrupt employee can cause his employer to overpay  for goods or services sold by a 
company in which he has a hidden interest, so too can he cause the employer to undersell to a 
company in which he maintains a hidden interest.
