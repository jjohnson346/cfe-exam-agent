Financial Disclosure 
Management has an obligation to disclose to the shareholders significant fraud committed by 
officers, executives, and others in positions of trust. Management does not have the 
responsibility of disclosing uncharged criminal conduct of its officers and executives. 
However, if and when officers, executives, or other persons in trusted positions become 
subjects of a criminal indictment, disclosure is required.

The inadequate disclosure of conflicts of interest is among the most serious of frauds.
