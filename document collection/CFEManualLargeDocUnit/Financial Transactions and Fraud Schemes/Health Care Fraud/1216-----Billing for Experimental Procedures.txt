Health Care Fraud

Billing for Experimental Procedures 
It is reported that one form of medical fraud that is little known, but apparently widespread, 
is the third-party billing for experiments with new medical devices that have not yet been 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Some hospitals are deliberately misleading 
third-party payers by getting them to pay for the manufacturer’s research. Many of the 
doctors involved are alleged to have stock in the manufacturing companies.
