Payment Inducements 
These schemes involve brokers furnishing group coverage to individuals who would not 
otherwise qualify for such policies by adding them to legitimate groups or establishing a 
fictitious group for the purpose of obtaining waivers and/or cheaper rates. The broker 
profits not only from the normal sales commission, but also from a “surcharge” or billing 
fee that is added to the published premium that is collected from the policy holder by the 
broker. In another scenario, a broker may charge a markup for adding employees to a 
legitimate group.
