Clinical Labs 
Clinical labs have devised fraudulent billing practices to encourage physicians to order 
unnecessary tests on patients. The schemes caused specific blood tests to be included in a 
panel of frequently ordered tests. The ordering physician pays nothing or a nominal fee for 
the extra tests. The tests are then unbundled and billed separately by the lab to government 
payers and insurance companies.
