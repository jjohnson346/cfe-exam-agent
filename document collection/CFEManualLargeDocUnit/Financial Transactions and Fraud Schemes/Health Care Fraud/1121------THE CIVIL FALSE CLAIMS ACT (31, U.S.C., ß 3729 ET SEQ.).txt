THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT (31, U.S.C., § 3729 ET SEQ.) 
The False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 through 3733) is a civil statute that generally 
provides liability for false statements and representations made to an officer or employee of 
the federal government. As the civil counterpart to the criminal False Claims Act, it provides 
a separate civil cause of action that may be taken in addition to a criminal prosecution. 
 
The Civil False Claims Act provides in part that a person who violates its provisions is liable 
to the government for any treble damages it sustains and a civil penalty of $5,000 to $10,000 
per false claim. 
 
The penalties for violation of the Act range from $5,000 to $10,000 plus up to three times 
the amount of the government’s damages. In  addition, violators may be suspended from 
participating in Medicaid programs.

In addition to allowing the government to recover penalties and damages for false claims, 
the Civil False Claims Act allows a private party to prosecute a civil action against the 
perpetrator(s) on behalf of the government. This is called a qui tam action and is discussed in 
further detail below. 
 
The most commonly prosecuted acts under the statute result from the following: 
• The receipt of false or fraudulent claims paid by the government 
• The use of false or fraudulent records or statements to avoid payment to the government 
 
To bring an action under the Civil False Claims Act stemming from Medicaid fraud, there 
must be a false statement or representation in connection with either of the following: 
• The wrongful disposal of Medicaid assets 
• Solicitation or payment of Medicaid claims 
 
Even if a state’s Medicaid program is admini stered exclusively by the state, because the 
program is subsidized with federal funds, all false or fraudulent claims submitted to the 
state’s Medicaid program fall within the guise of  the Civil False Claims Act as claims against 
the federal government. 
 
The following examples are typical violations under the Civil False Claims Act: 
• Physician billing for services provided by residents as if the services were performed by 
the physician 
• Billing for upcoded medical services covered by Medicaid 
• Marketing and selling bundles tests (necessa ry and unnecessary tests) to referring 
physicians, who then bill Medicaid at a higher rate than authorized 
• Misdiagnosing Medicaid beneficiaries as having medical conditions, and then billing for 
services that wouldn’t otherwise be covered
