Inflated Billings 
Health care billings can be inflated by providers as well as insureds. The following are some 
of the most common fraud schemes encountered by investigators and claims approvers: 
• Altering claims  
• Adding services 
• Code manipulation 
 
Altered Claims 
Altering valid claims can be accomplished using a pen; photocopier; or scanner, computer, 
and printer. Common alterations are:  
• Amounts changed 
• Date of service changed 
• Name of patient changed 
 
Financial Transactions  Health Care Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1225 
For example, a medical bill can be altered by placing an additional number in front of the 
amount charged. The date of service can be altered so that it becomes a covered expense 
rather than one that was incurred prior to being eligible for coverage. The individual 
submitting a claim can change the name on the bill from a noncovered family member to 
one who is covered under the contract. 
 
Detection 
Procedures can help identify altered claims include: 
• Analyzing charges and identifying any excessive claims for prescription or medical 
services above an acceptable level. 
• Looking for any alterations, erasures, changes of  ink, or white-outs on the original bill 
prior to paying the claim. This is important in today’s environment in which original 
bills, checks, and other documents are destroyed as soon as they are microfilmed to 
minimize storage space for record keeping.  
• Training adjusters to look for obvious alterations when processing claims. 
 
Added Services 
Some fraudsters add on services never rendered to dates of actual services. In these cases, 
the verification process is the same as the procedures listed under the alteration process. 
 
Code Manipulation 
Code manipulation is a problem that is faced by all health insurers. Each service is identified 
using the American Medical Association’s uniformly accepted coding system, called the 
Physicians’ Current Procedural Terminology (CPT). Medicare and most private insurers have 
developed fee schedules that use CPT codes and their accompanying narrative descriptions 
as the basis for paying providers.  
 
However, because the coding system is complicated, providers and insurers often have 
difficulty identifying the codes that most accurately describe the services provided. The 
coding system is difficult to use because it attempts to identify codes for all accepted medical 
procedures, including codes to describe minor procedures that are components of more 
comprehensive procedures. Payment policies add to the difficulty. For example, the fee for 
surgery often includes the cost of related services for the global service period, that is, for a 
set number of days before and after the surgery. To prevent overpayment in these cases, 
insurers need to identify when claims for surgery include codes that represent related 
services and reduce the payment accordingly.

It is difficult for providers and insurers to maintain proficiency in proper coding practices 
because a substantial number of the codes are changed each year. These complexities can 
inadvertently lead providers to submit improperly coded claims. They also make insurers 
vulnerable to abuse from providers or billing services that attempt to maximize 
reimbursements by intentionally submitting claims containing inappropriate combinations  
of codes. 
 
Unbundling Charges/Fragmentation 
Simple unbundling occurs when a provider charges a comprehensive code as well as one or 
more component codes. For instance, in the examples illustrated below, the provider would 
be overpaid because the fee for the total procedure already includes the value of its 
component parts.

Total Payment $1,997 
 
Unbundling can be detected through the use of a computer program that determines 
whether each code submitted is a component of one or more comprehensive codes. 
 
Mutually Exclusive Procedures 
A variation of unbundling, this scam involves billing for procedures that are  
either impossible to perform together or, by accepted standards, should not be  
performed together.

Global Service Period Violations 
Some dishonest providers will bill for a major procedure—such as a surgery—as well as 
related procedures, when the fee for the major procedure already includes the fee for related 
procedures during the predefined time period (the global service period). This type of fraud 
is possible because most surgery includes all related services for a set number of days before 
and after the surgery. Detecting these abuses can be difficult because the examiner must 
determine which services are related to the surgery and which are not. This difficulty is 
compounded by the fact that such services may be rendered by more than one provider. 
 
Upcoding 
Upcoding is billing for a higher level of service than was rendered. One common form of 
upcoding involves generic substitution—filling a prescription with a less expensive drug, 
while billing for the more expensive form of the drug.  
 
Misuse of New Patient Codes 
The CPT coding system includes special codes for new patient visits, which enable the 
physicians to be reimbursed for the additional work that new patient visits typically require. 
Consequently, physicians who want to pad their claims may bill for visits with established 
patients using new patient codes.
