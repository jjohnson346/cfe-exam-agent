False Claims and Statements 
Though there is a statute specifically designed to combat false claims in connection with 
health care benefits programs, the federal false claims statutes may be used to combat certain 
types of health care fraud. Some examples of false claims and statements include: 
• Falsified contractor qualifications 
• False certifications or assurances 
• False records or invoices 
• Invoices from nonexistent companies 
• Claims made in duplicate or altered invoices 
• Billing for fictitious employees 
• Billing for goods and services not provided 
• Inflated costs or substitution of cheaper goods 
 
Although these statutes are discussed in more detail in the Law section of the Fraud 
Examiners Manual, this discussion will provide a brief overview of the main false claims and 
statements statutes used to combat health care fraud, including: false statements under 
section 1001, the criminal False Claims Act, and the Civil False Claims Act. 
 
FALSE STATEMENTS (18, U.S.C., § 1001) 
Although there are a number of federal statutes that prohibit making false claims and 
statements to the federal government, the term false statement usually refers to the Federal 
False Statements statute laid out in Section 1001 of Title 18, United States Code. Briefly 
stated, the law prohibits a person from lying to or concealing information from a federal 
official. 
 
Under section 1001, a false statement can be oral, written, sworn or unsworn, signed or 
unsigned. The false statement, however, must be about a material fact, and it must be

capable of influencing the outcome of the agency action. The elements of a typical section 
1001 violation are set forth below: 
• The defendant made a false statement (or used a false document) 
• That was material 
• Regarding a matter within the jurisdiction of any agency of the United States 
• With knowledge of its falsity 
 
THE CRIMINAL FALSE CLAIMS ACT (18, U.S.C., § 287) 
This statute makes it illegal to present or make any false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim 
against any agency or department of the United States. The crime is complete when the 
claim is presented and payment of the claim is not an element of the offense.  
 
To establish violation of this statute, the government must establish all of the following 
elements:  
• The defendant made or presented  
• Any claim that was false, fictitious, or fraudulent 
• The defendant knew the claim was false, fictitious, or fraudulent 
 
Violators of this statute may be imprisoned not more than five years and subject to a fine of 
$250,000. 
 
THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT (31, U.S.C., § 3729 ET SEQ.) 
The False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 through 3733) is a civil statute that generally 
provides liability for false statements and representations made to an officer or employee of 
the federal government. As the civil counterpart to the criminal False Claims Act, it provides 
a separate civil cause of action that may be taken in addition to a criminal prosecution. 
 
The Civil False Claims Act provides in part that a person who violates its provisions is liable 
to the government for any treble damages it sustains and a civil penalty of $5,000 to $10,000 
per false claim. 
 
The penalties for violation of the Act range from $5,000 to $10,000 plus up to three times 
the amount of the government’s damages. In  addition, violators may be suspended from 
participating in Medicaid programs.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1207 
In addition to allowing the government to recover penalties and damages for false claims, 
the Civil False Claims Act allows a private party to prosecute a civil action against the 
perpetrator(s) on behalf of the government. This is called a qui tam action and is discussed in 
further detail below. 
 
The most commonly prosecuted acts under the statute result from the following: 
• The receipt of false or fraudulent claims paid by the government 
• The use of false or fraudulent records or statements to avoid payment to the government 
 
To bring an action under the Civil False Claims Act stemming from Medicaid fraud, there 
must be a false statement or representation in connection with either of the following: 
• The wrongful disposal of Medicaid assets 
• Solicitation or payment of Medicaid claims 
 
Even if a state’s Medicaid program is admini stered exclusively by the state, because the 
program is subsidized with federal funds, all false or fraudulent claims submitted to the 
state’s Medicaid program fall within the guise of  the Civil False Claims Act as claims against 
the federal government. 
 
The following examples are typical violations under the Civil False Claims Act: 
• Physician billing for services provided by residents as if the services were performed by 
the physician 
• Billing for upcoded medical services covered by Medicaid 
• Marketing and selling bundles tests (necessa ry and unnecessary tests) to referring 
physicians, who then bill Medicaid at a higher rate than authorized 
• Misdiagnosing Medicaid beneficiaries as having medical conditions, and then billing for 
services that wouldn’t otherwise be covered
