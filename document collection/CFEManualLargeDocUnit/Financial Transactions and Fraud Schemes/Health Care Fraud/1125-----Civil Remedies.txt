Civil Remedies 
There are many federal statutes that victims of health care fraud can use to obtain relief. The 
False Claims Act and RICO both provide for civil remedies in addition to criminal penalties.  
 
In addition, one of the most effective remedies is available under the Civil Monetary 
Penalties Law (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a). Under this  law, administrative actions can be invoked 
against providers who defraud any federally funded program by filing false claims or other 
improper billing practices. Any person (including an organization, agency, or other entity, 
but excluding a beneficiary) who violates the law is subject to civil monetary penalties. 
Violators can be fined up to $10,000 for each medical service that was fraudulently 
represented, and they may be excluded from participating in government programs.
