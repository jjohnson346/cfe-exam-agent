ERISA Fraud 
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act regulates all trust accounts held by an 
employer for the purpose of paying benefits such as retirement annuities or health and life 
policies. Under the Act, if an insurance company believes that a plan administrator is 
engaging in violations of the Act, it is required to report the matter to the U.S. Department 
of Labor. As an example, a corporation may use funds collected from employees through 
payroll deduction to finance daily operations of the company.
