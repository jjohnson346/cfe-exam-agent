Laws Relating to Health Care Fraud 
Numerous criminal and civil federal and state laws are available in the prosecution of health 
care fraud. In addition, regulatory agencies are also available for licensure action.  
 
Federal Criminal Laws 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
As part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, 
Congress made a number of changes to the federal criminal code. In fact, the promulgation 
of HIPAA was the first massive sweep to wipe out health care fraud.  
 
The Act established several criminal statutes related specifically to health care fraud.  Under 
HIPAA, there are five federal crimes directed at health care fraud. Specifically, HIPAA made 
it illegal for anyone to knowingly and willfully: 
• Carry out a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program (18, U.S.C., § 1347) 
• Steal or embezzle any funds, property, or money of a health care benefit program (18, U.S.C., § 669) 
• Make false statements relating to health care matters (18, U.S.C., § 1035) 
• Obstruct a criminal investigations of a health care offense (18, U.S.C., § 1518)

1.1202                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
More specifically, under section 1347, which establishes a federal offense of “health care 
fraud,” it is illegal for anyone to:  
• Knowingly and willfully  
• Executes, or attempts to execute  
• A scheme or artifice intended to 
? Defraud a health care benefit program, or 
? By false or fraudulent means, obtain money or property owned by, or under the 
custody or control of, any health care benefit program 
 
The term health care benefit program as used in these statutes is defined to mean “any public or 
private plan or contract, affecting commerce, under which any medical benefit, item, or 
service is provided to any individual, and includes any individual or entity who is providing a 
medical benefit, item, or service for which payment may be made under the plan  
or contract.” 
 
The Act also provides that a judge order a person convicted of a federal health care offense 
to forfeit any property that can be traced from the proceeds received from the offense. More 
information concerning these statutes is set out in the Law section. 
 
Moreover, pursuant to its purpose in providing funds to combat health care fraud, HIPAA 
launched the Fraud and Abuse Control Program, which: 
• Coordinates federal, state, and local law enforcement programs to control fraud and 
abuse as applicable to Medicaid programs;  
• Conducts investigations, audits, evaluations, and inspections as they relate to delivery and 
payment for Medicaid services;  
• Modifies and establishes Safe Harbor Provisions;  
• Issues advisory opinions and special fraud alerts; and  
• Provides reporting and disclosure requirements of adverse actions (under the Health 
Care Fraud and Abuse Data Collection Program).  
 
Furthermore, as part of the implementation of HIPAA, the Secretary of the Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS) was directed to create the Health Integrity and 
Protection Data Bank (HIPDB). The HIPDB is a reporting mechanism that allows users to 
access and review final adverse actions taken against practitioners, providers, and suppliers. 
Access to the data bank, however, is limited to federal and state government agencies and 
health plans.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1203 
The Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute (42, U.S.C., § 1320a-7b(b)) 
The Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute (also known as the Federal Healthcare 
Anti-kickback Act) may also be used to combat healthcare fraud. This statute prohibits an 
individual from making payments to induce the purchase of healthcare goods or services that 
will be paid for by a federal health care program. Specifically, the statute prohibits: 
• The knowing and willful 
• Payment or receipt of any form of remuneration (including kickbacks, bribes, and 
rebates)  
• To induce someone to recommend or to purchase, order, or recommend any service that 
may be paid for under a federal health care program 
 
The statute encompasses a very broad array of activities that can be classified as Medicaid 
fraud. It applies to all federally funded health care programs, not just Medicaid.  
 
The statute criminally penalizes individuals who actually receive, as well as those who merely 
solicit, Medicaid remuneration. So long as the defendant’s intent is knowing and willful, and 
his means of involvement includes the receipt or solicitation of the kickback, the crime is 
prosecutable. But generally, it is difficult to determine whether the defendant intended to act 
knowingly and willfully, and neither “knowingly” nor “willfully” is defined in the statute. 
Thus, their interpretations are left for the courts to decipher, and this has inherently led to 
discrepancies in determining a defendant’s intent. 
 
The following examples are types of activities that typically violate the Medicare and 
Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute: 
• Payments for Medicaid patient referrals 
• Payments from a self-referral joint venture to investors for Medicaid patient referrals 
• Involvement in a consignment agreement, whereby performance under the agreement is 
based upon a percentage-based compensation scheme 
• A physician who performs little or no services to Medicaid patients yet receives large 
amounts of money for referring those patients to hospitals under ostensible services 
contracts 
 
The Stark Law (Physician Self-Referrals) 
The Stark Law (also known as the physician self -referral law) attempts to limit the ability of 
physicians to profit from their referrals by prohibiting physicians from referring 
Medicare/Medicaid patients for designated health services (DHS) entities with which the 
Health Care Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1204                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
physician or his immediate family member has a financial relationship. The law was passed in 
two phases.   
 
Stark I was enacted as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989; it prohibited 
a physician from referring a patient to a clinical laboratory with which he (or an immediate 
family member) has a financial relationship. 
 
Stark II provided additional amendments and expanded the referral and billing prohibitions 
to additional “designated health services.” It strengthened Stark I’s prohibitions on physician 
referrals from certain designated health services (DHS) entities with which the physician or 
his immediate family member has a financial relationship. 
 
As related to Medicaid, Stark II prohibits a physician, in exchange for a payment of equity or 
reduction of debt, without an exception, to make: 
• A Medicaid referral;  
• A Medicaid claim; or  
• Compensation arrangement.  
 
In addition to these codified requirements, states often supplement the federal requirements 
with more stringent state requirements. For example, in Pennsylvania, physicians are 
prohibited from making any automatic referrals, whether they are enunciated in direct or 
indirect agreements with other health providers.  
 
Despite the general rule that physicians cannot profit from their referrals, there are several 
exceptions and safe harbor provisions to protect physicians from making certain referrals. In 
part, these exceptions include: referrals to and from physicians in the same group practice, 
same in-office ancillary services, prepaid plans, legitimate personal services arrangements, 
and physician recruitment. 
 
Although Stark II appears to mimic the Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute, the 
two laws are different. First, unlike the Anti-Kickback Act, which applies to all individuals, 
Stark II only applies to physicians and their family members. Second, where the Medicare 
and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute provides criminal penalties for its violations, Stark II is 
codified as a civil statute, and therefore only imposes monetary penalties, suspension, and 
termination. Finally, under Stark II, each Medi caid entity providing items or services for 
Financial Transactions  Health Care Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1205 
payment must comply with reporting requirements and disclose information relating to the 
entity’s ownership, investment, and compensation arrangements. 
 
Violations of Stark II may subject a defendant to  $15,000 for each service improperly billed 
or claimed, $100,000 for participation in a circumvention arrangement or scheme, exclusion 
from participating as a provider in Medicaid programs, and/or a penalty of $10,000 each day 
reporting is delinquent. 
 
False Claims and Statements 
Though there is a statute specifically designed to combat false claims in connection with 
health care benefits programs, the federal false claims statutes may be used to combat certain 
types of health care fraud. Some examples of false claims and statements include: 
• Falsified contractor qualifications 
• False certifications or assurances 
• False records or invoices 
• Invoices from nonexistent companies 
• Claims made in duplicate or altered invoices 
• Billing for fictitious employees 
• Billing for goods and services not provided 
• Inflated costs or substitution of cheaper goods 
 
Although these statutes are discussed in more detail in the Law section of the Fraud 
Examiners Manual, this discussion will provide a brief overview of the main false claims and 
statements statutes used to combat health care fraud, including: false statements under 
section 1001, the criminal False Claims Act, and the Civil False Claims Act. 
 
FALSE STATEMENTS (18, U.S.C., § 1001) 
Although there are a number of federal statutes that prohibit making false claims and 
statements to the federal government, the term false statement usually refers to the Federal 
False Statements statute laid out in Section 1001 of Title 18, United States Code. Briefly 
stated, the law prohibits a person from lying to or concealing information from a federal 
official. 
 
Under section 1001, a false statement can be oral, written, sworn or unsworn, signed or 
unsigned. The false statement, however, must be about a material fact, and it must be 
Health Care Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1206                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
capable of influencing the outcome of the agency action. The elements of a typical section 
1001 violation are set forth below: 
• The defendant made a false statement (or used a false document) 
• That was material 
• Regarding a matter within the jurisdiction of any agency of the United States 
• With knowledge of its falsity 
 
THE CRIMINAL FALSE CLAIMS ACT (18, U.S.C., § 287) 
This statute makes it illegal to present or make any false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim 
against any agency or department of the United States. The crime is complete when the 
claim is presented and payment of the claim is not an element of the offense.  
 
To establish violation of this statute, the government must establish all of the following 
elements:  
• The defendant made or presented  
• Any claim that was false, fictitious, or fraudulent 
• The defendant knew the claim was false, fictitious, or fraudulent 
 
Violators of this statute may be imprisoned not more than five years and subject to a fine of 
$250,000. 
 
THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT (31, U.S.C., § 3729 ET SEQ.) 
The False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 through 3733) is a civil statute that generally 
provides liability for false statements and representations made to an officer or employee of 
the federal government. As the civil counterpart to the criminal False Claims Act, it provides 
a separate civil cause of action that may be taken in addition to a criminal prosecution. 
 
The Civil False Claims Act provides in part that a person who violates its provisions is liable 
to the government for any treble damages it sustains and a civil penalty of $5,000 to $10,000 
per false claim. 
 
The penalties for violation of the Act range from $5,000 to $10,000 plus up to three times 
the amount of the government’s damages. In  addition, violators may be suspended from 
participating in Medicaid programs. 
 
Financial Transactions  Health Care Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1207 
In addition to allowing the government to recover penalties and damages for false claims, 
the Civil False Claims Act allows a private party to prosecute a civil action against the 
perpetrator(s) on behalf of the government. This is called a qui tam action and is discussed in 
further detail below. 
 
The most commonly prosecuted acts under the statute result from the following: 
• The receipt of false or fraudulent claims paid by the government 
• The use of false or fraudulent records or statements to avoid payment to the government 
 
To bring an action under the Civil False Claims Act stemming from Medicaid fraud, there 
must be a false statement or representation in connection with either of the following: 
• The wrongful disposal of Medicaid assets 
• Solicitation or payment of Medicaid claims 
 
Even if a state’s Medicaid program is admini stered exclusively by the state, because the 
program is subsidized with federal funds, all false or fraudulent claims submitted to the 
state’s Medicaid program fall within the guise of  the Civil False Claims Act as claims against 
the federal government. 
 
The following examples are typical violations under the Civil False Claims Act: 
• Physician billing for services provided by residents as if the services were performed by 
the physician 
• Billing for upcoded medical services covered by Medicaid 
• Marketing and selling bundles tests (necessa ry and unnecessary tests) to referring 
physicians, who then bill Medicaid at a higher rate than authorized 
• Misdiagnosing Medicaid beneficiaries as having medical conditions, and then billing for 
services that wouldn’t otherwise be covered 
 
Computer Fraud 
Section 1030 of Title 18, U.S. Code, may also be used to combat health care fraud schemes 
involving computers. Under this section, any scheme that uses a computer as the instrument 
or vehicle by which funds could be illegally transferred or uses a computer to obtain 
confidential information may be prosecuted.  
 
Health Care Fraud  Financial Transactions   
1.1208                           2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
EXAMPLE 
An insurance company employee generates a false claim in the company computer making a 
fraudulent payment to a friend who then  shares the bounty with the employee. 
 
Money Laundering 
The money laundering statutes may also be effective in deterring and punishing individuals 
who commit health care fraud. Section 1956 of Title 18, U.S. Code, criminalizes financial 
transactions involving proceeds of unlawful activity. Property qualifies as the proceeds of 
illegal activity if it is derived from a “specified unlawful activity,” which HIPAA amended to 
include health care offenses.  
 
Using the federal money laundering statutes is beneficial because they allow the government 
to seize property through civil forfeiture (i.e., the government may seize property before 
judgment to ensure it will be secure until a hearing can be held). 
 
The text of the money laundering statutes can be found in the Law section of the Fraud 
Examiners Manual. 
 
Other Federal Statutes 
The following federal laws are also commonly used in the prosecution of health care fraud 
cases. More detail on each of these statutes can be found in the “Law Related to Fraud” 
chapter in the Law section of the Fraud Examiners Manual. 
• Mail and Wire Fraud, Title 18, U.S.C., §§ 1341, 1343 : Mail and wire fraud makes it a crime 
to use the mails or wire communications to perpetrate a scheme to defraud a victim of 
money or property (e.g., present a false claim to Medicare, state health plan, or private 
insurer).  
• Conspiracy, Title 18, U.S.C., § 371, Title 18, U.S.C., § 286 : Section 286 makes it a crime for 
two or more people to agree or conspire to defraud the United States by obtaining, or 
aiding in obtaining, payment or allowance of any false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim. 
• Obstruction of Federal Audit, Title 18, U.S.C., § 1516 : This statute, originally passed in 1988, 
makes it a felony for anyone to influence, obstruct, or impede a federal auditor in the 
performance of his official duties. This statute is relevant to health care fraud because 
audits are the main tool used by the government to monitor healthcare provider 
performance and are generally the first step in any health care fraud investigation.  
• Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Statute, Title 18, U.S.C., § 1961–1968: 
RICO outlaws the investment of ill-gotten gains in another business enterprise, the 
Financial Transactions  Health Care Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual   1.1209 
acquisition of an interest in an enterprise through certain illegal acts, and the conduct of 
the affairs of an enterprise through such acts. 
• Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Title 15, U.S.C., § 1693n: Section 1693n applies to paperless 
money transfers between accounts, and in general, it attaches criminal liability to the acts 
of giving false or inaccurate information under the banking laws and regulations and 
failing to provide information required under the banking laws and regulations. 
 
Civil Remedies 
There are many federal statutes that victims of health care fraud can use to obtain relief. The 
False Claims Act and RICO both provide for civil remedies in addition to criminal penalties.  
 
In addition, one of the most effective remedies is available under the Civil Monetary 
Penalties Law (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a). Under this  law, administrative actions can be invoked 
against providers who defraud any federally funded program by filing false claims or other 
improper billing practices. Any person (including an organization, agency, or other entity, 
but excluding a beneficiary) who violates the law is subject to civil monetary penalties. 
Violators can be fined up to $10,000 for each medical service that was fraudulently 
represented, and they may be excluded from participating in government programs.  
 
State Statutes 
Although fraud is illegal in every state, not all states have specific legislation against insurance 
fraud. Laws such as “grand theft,” “scheme to  defraud,” or “fraud by deception” must be 
used to charge offenders. Nineteen states have passed legislation that specifically prohibits 
insurance fraud although the effectiveness varies according to the provisions in each statute. 
For example, in some states, health insurance fraud is illegal, but there is no immunity to the 
insurance company for reporting fraud. 
 
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) adopted the Insurance 
Fraud Prevention Model Act. The key provisions include:  
• Mandatory reporting of fraud. 
• Immunity from prosecution for reporting fraud. 
• Making insurance fraud a felony under state law.  
• Requiring a fraud warning on claim forms. 
• Requiring anti-fraud initiatives including mandatory special investigation units. 
• Restitution to the victim.

Regulatory Boards 
Since most medical practitioners are required to be licensed by their state to practice, the 
regulatory boards have jurisdiction over the licensees and can take action when appropriate. 
The regulatory boards will take action when the patient’s health is in jeopardy, fraud has 
been committed, continuing education requirements are not met, or other similar 
circumstances. In most instances, when a licensee is convicted of fraud, it is not automatic 
that his license is suspended or revoked. A separate action and investigation must be 
completed for that to happen. In many cases, however, when there is not enough evidence 
to sustain a criminal conviction, the licensing boards may be able to take action and offer 
relief. 
 
“Running” and “Capping” Legislation 
Many states have enacted legislation to prevent attorneys from using runners or cappers to 
solicit business. Although state disciplinary rules generally prohibit this practice, very few 
attorneys have received any substantial sanctions. Some states, such as California, have taken 
the initiative to criminalize running and capping.  
 
Under a California law passed in July 1993, insurance companies now have the right to bring 
a lawsuit against any person who hires runners or cappers to procure clients or patients to 
obtain workers’ compensation benefits (Ins. Code 1971.7). This action need not be brought 
in the insurance company’s name. Instead, the insurance company can act on behalf of the 
“People of the State of California.”
