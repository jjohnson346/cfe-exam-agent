An Overview of the Medicaid System 
For a state to establish a Medicaid program for its residents, it must comply with specific 
federal guidelines. Each state must: 
• Establish its own eligibility standards;  
• Determine the type, amount, duration, and scope of services;  
• Set the rate of payment for services; and  
• Administer its own program.
