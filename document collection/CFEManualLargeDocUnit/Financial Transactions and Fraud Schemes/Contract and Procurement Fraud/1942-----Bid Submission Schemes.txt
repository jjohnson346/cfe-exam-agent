Bid Submission Schemes 
Bid submission schemes can take on many forms. They can involve anyone in the contracting 
cycle such as a buyer or contracting official, engineer, technical representative, quality or 
product assurance representative, or subcontractor liaison employee — anyone who can 
influence the awarding of a contract. 
 
Examples of bid submission schemes are: 
• Premature opening of bids 
• Altering bids 
• Unjustifiable extension of bid opening dates 
• Controlled bid opening  
• Falsifying bid logs and documents
