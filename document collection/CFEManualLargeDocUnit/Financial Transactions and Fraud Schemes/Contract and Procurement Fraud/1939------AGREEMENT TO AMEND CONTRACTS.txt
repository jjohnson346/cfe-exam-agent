AGREEMENT TO AMEND CONTRACTS 
In situations where there is collusion between the buyer and supplier, there is sometimes an 
agreement to award the contract based on skimpy specifications, and then increase the price 
later once the contract has been awarded through amendments to the contract. 
 
DETECTION - BID SPECIFICATIONS  
The following is a list of potential red flags for frauds involving specifications: 
• Providing the contractor with information or advice on a preferential basis. 
• Using statements of work, specification, or sole source justifications developed by, or in 
consultation with, a contractor who will be permitted to bid. 
• Permitting consultants who assisted in the preparation of the statements of work, 
specifications, or design to perform on the contract as subcontractors or consultants. 
• Splitting costs into separate categories to avoid review. 
• Writing specifications not consistent with past similar procurement.
