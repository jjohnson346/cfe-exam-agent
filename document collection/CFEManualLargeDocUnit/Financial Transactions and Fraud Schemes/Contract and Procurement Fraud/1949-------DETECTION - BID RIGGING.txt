DETECTION - BID RIGGING
To detect these types of fraud, the fraud examiner must be alert for: 
• “Unsuccessful” bidders who later become subcontractors. 
• Wide disparity in bid prices. 
• Same contractors who bid on all projects with rotating low bidders. 
• Other qualified vendors who fail to submit bids. 
• Bid protests from losing, qualified bidders. 
• Splitting up requirements so contractors can each get a “fair share,” and can rotate bids. 
• A rotational pattern to winning bidders. 
• A geographical pattern to winning bidders. 
• Joint venture bids by firms who could have bid individually.
