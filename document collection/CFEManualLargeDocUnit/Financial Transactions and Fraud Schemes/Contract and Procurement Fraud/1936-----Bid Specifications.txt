Bid Specifications 
Bid specifications and statements of work detailing the types and amounts of goods and 
services to be provided are prepared to assist in the selection process. They are intended to 
provide both potential bidders and the selecting officials with a firm basis for making and 
accepting bids. 
 
A well-written contract will contain specifications, standards, and statements of work that 
clearly detail the rights and entitlements of the contractor. Carelessly written specifications, 
standards, and statements of work make it easier for a contractor to claim at a later time that 
he is entitled to more money than the buyer intended to pay. 
 
Sometimes, the buyer’s personnel and the contractor deliberately collude to write vague 
specifications. At other times, there is an agreement to amend the contract to increase the 
price immediately after the award. One contractor actually developed a “cost enhancement 
plan,” which identified all the changes he would make in order to double the cost of the 
contract, before it was even signed. 
 
POORLY WRITTEN SPECIFICATIONS 
In some instances, the fraud is committed solely by the contractor based on poorly written 
specifications. In the instance of poorly written specifications, it is easy for the contractor to 
deliver a product or service that is priced higher than what was ordered. 
 
VAGUE SPECIFICATIONS 
In other instances, vague specifications are deliberately written by the buyer in collusion with 
the contractor, so that more money can be claimed later.

AGREEMENT TO AMEND CONTRACTS 
In situations where there is collusion between the buyer and supplier, there is sometimes an 
agreement to award the contract based on skimpy specifications, and then increase the price 
later once the contract has been awarded through amendments to the contract. 
 
DETECTION - BID SPECIFICATIONS  
The following is a list of potential red flags for frauds involving specifications: 
• Providing the contractor with information or advice on a preferential basis. 
• Using statements of work, specification, or sole source justifications developed by, or in 
consultation with, a contractor who will be permitted to bid. 
• Permitting consultants who assisted in the preparation of the statements of work, 
specifications, or design to perform on the contract as subcontractors or consultants. 
• Splitting costs into separate categories to avoid review. 
• Writing specifications not consistent with past similar procurement.
