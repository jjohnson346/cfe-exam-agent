“I Don’t Remember” 
Usually, this is not an expression of resistance. Instead, it is an expression of modesty, 
tentativeness, or caution. One of the best ways to respond is to simply remain silent while 
the person is deliberating. He is saying, in effect, “Give me a moment to think.” If this is not 
successful, the best way to counter is to pose an alternate, narrower question. As with other 
symptoms of resistance, the resistance is accepted and diffused, and an alternate question  
is posed. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Mr. McGuire, I understand you might not remember the entire transaction. Do you remember 
if it was more than $10,000?” 
OR 
“It’s okay if you don’t remember the details. Do you remember how it made you react at the 
time?”
