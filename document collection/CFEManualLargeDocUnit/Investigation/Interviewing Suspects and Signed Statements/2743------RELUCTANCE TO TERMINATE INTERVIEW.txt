RELUCTANCE TO TERMINATE INTERVIEW 
Dishonest people will generally be more reluctant than honest ones to terminate the 
interview. The dishonest individual wants to convince the interviewer that he is not 
responsible, so that the investigation will not continue. The honest person, on the other 
hand, generally has no such reluctance.
