“I’m Too Busy” 
When the interviewer contacts the respondent without a previous appointment, there is a 
possibility that the respondent will be too busy at the moment to cooperate. “I’m too busy” 
is also used as an excuse for the real source of the person’s resistance, which might be 
lethargy, ego threat, or a dislike of talking to strangers. These situations can be diffused by 
the interviewer stressing that: 
• The interview will be short. 
• The interviewer is already there. 
• The project is important. 
• The interview will not be difficult. 
• The interviewer needs help.
