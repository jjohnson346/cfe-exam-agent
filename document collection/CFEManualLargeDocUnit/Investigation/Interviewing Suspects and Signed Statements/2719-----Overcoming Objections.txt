Overcoming Objections 
Volatile witnesses voice numerous objections to being interviewed. Some of the most 
common objections (along with suggested responses) are listed below. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Respondent : 
“I don’t want to be involved.” 
 
Interviewer: 
The interviewer should answer this question by pointing out that he would not be 
there, asking questions, if the respondent were not involved. Point out that you are 
saving the respondent trouble by discussing the matter “informally” (do not say “off 
the record”).

Respondent : 
“Why should I talk to you?” 
 
Interviewer: 
The interviewer should answer that he is trying to clear up a problem, and that the 
respondent’s assistance is important. 
 
Respondent : 
“You can’t prove that!” 
 
Interviewer: 
The interviewer should tell the person that he is not trying to prove or disprove; you 
are simply gathering information. 
 
Respondent : 
“ You can’t make me talk!” 
 
Interviewer: 
Tell the person that you are not attempting to make him do anything; you are trying 
to resolve a problem, and would deeply appreciate help.
