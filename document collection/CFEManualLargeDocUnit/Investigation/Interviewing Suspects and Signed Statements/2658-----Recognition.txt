Recognition 
All human beings need the recognition and the esteem of others. Social interaction often 
depends on an exchange of social goods. People will “perform” in exchange for recognition 
and other social rewards. The need for recognition can be fulfilled by attention from people 
outside the individual’s social circle. The skillful and insightful interviewer takes advantage of 
every opportunity to give the respondent sincere recognition.
