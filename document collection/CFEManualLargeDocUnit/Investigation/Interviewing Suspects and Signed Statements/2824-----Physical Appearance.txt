Physical Appearance 
The investigator can often elicit additional information about the event by asking the witness 
to describe the suspect. A particularly effective technique is to ask the witness whether the 
suspect reminded the witness of anyone he knows. Often, physical descriptions, such as the 
type of clothing a suspect was wearing or the particular way a suspect walked or looked, will 
not be presented during the narrative phase of the interview. This additional information, 
however, can be key to linking a suspect with a specific crime.
