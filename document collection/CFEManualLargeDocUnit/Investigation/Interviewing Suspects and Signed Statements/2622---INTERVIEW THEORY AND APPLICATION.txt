INTERVIEW THEORY AND APPLICATION 
 
An interview is a question-and-answer session designed to elicit information. It differs from an 
ordinary conversation in that the interview is structured, not free-form, and is designed for a 
purpose. An interview might consist of only one question or a series of questions. 
 
 
Preparation 
Before embarking on an interview, the examiner should review the case file to ensure that it 
does not contain important information that has been overlooked. In addition, the examiner 
should review the case file to learn what information is known to the witness. The 
hypothesis should be reviewed to make sure it reflects the obtained documents. 
 
The examiner should consider what type of information can be supplied by each of the 
potential witnesses. Generally, the most vulnerable witness should be interviewed after the 
more reluctant witnesses. This will provide the examiner with a broader base of information 
that can be used to formulate later questions. However, the timing of interviews is at the 
discretion of the examination team. 
 
 
Characteristics of a Good Interview 
Good interviews share common characteristics. The interview should be of sufficient length 
and depth to uncover relevant facts. Most interviewers tend to get too little, rather than too 
much, information. 
 
A good interview includes all pertinent information and excludes irrelevant information. 
From the outset, it should be determined what information is relevant, and that information 
should be sought. Extraneous or useless facts tend to unnecessarily complicate the gathering 
and analysis of the information. 
 
The interview should be conducted as closely as possible to the event in question. With the 
passage of time, the memories of potential witnesses and respondents become faulty, and 
critical details can be lost or forgotten. A good interview is objective in scope. It should be 
aimed at gathering information in a fair and impartial manner.  
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.202   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Characteristics of a Good Interviewer 
All good interviewers share certain characteristics. Above all, they are “people persons,” and 
are talented at human interaction. Successful interviewers are the type of people with whom 
others are willing to share information. The good interviewer does not interrupt the 
respondent with unnecessary questions. During the interview, much pertinent information 
results from volunteered information, as opposed to responses to a specific question. The 
good interviewer displays interest in his subject and in what is being said. 
 
The respondent must understand that the interviewer is attempting to obtain only the 
relevant facts and is not “out to get” someone. This can best be done by phrasing questions 
in a nonaccusatory manner. Little is accomplished when the interviewer is formal, 
ostentatious, or attempts to impress the respondent with his authority. Information 
gathering is best accomplished by approaching the interview in an informal and low- 
key fashion. 
 
If the respondent perceives that the interviewer is biased or is attempting to confirm 
foregone conclusions, the respondent will be less likely to cooperate. Accordingly, the 
interviewer should make every effort to demonstrate a lack of bias. 
 
Professionalism in the interview often involves a state of mind and a commitment to 
excellence. The interviewer should be on time, be professionally attired, and be fair in all 
dealings with the respondent. It is absolutely vital that the interviewer not appear to be a 
threat. If people perceive that they are the target of an inquiry, they will be less likely  
to cooperate. 
 
 
Question Typology 
When conducting an interview, there are five general types of questions an interviewer can 
ask: introductory, informational, assessment, closing, and admission-seeking.  
 
Because fraud examinations move in a linear order, starting with the general and working to 
the specific, the first interviews should be with those that are least likely to be involved, 
working towards those that are more likely to be involved. The first interviews are 
conducted for the purpose of gathering information, and therefore they should be non-confrontational, 
non-threatening, and should encourage open communication. In these 
routine interview situations, only three of the five types of questions will normally be asked: 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.203 
introductory, informational, and closing questions. If the interviewer has reasonable cause to 
believe the respondent is not being truthful, assessment questions can be asked. Finally, if 
the interviewer decides with reasonable cause that the respondent is responsible for 
misdeeds, admission-seeking questions can be posed. 
 
Introductory Questions 
Introductory questions are designed to meet the four objectives below: to provide an 
introduction, establish rapport, to get the respondent to verbally agree to cooperate in the 
interview (i.e., establish the interview theme), and to observe the respondent’s reactions to 
questions. 
 
Informational Questions 
Once the proper format for the interview is set, the interviewer then turns to the fact-gathering 
portion. Typically, the interviewer will ask three types of questions during this 
stage: open, closed, and leading. These question types are discussed in more detail below. 
Each type is used in a logical sequence to maximize the development of information. If the 
interviewer has reason to believe that the respondent is being untruthful, then assessment 
questions can be posed. Otherwise, the interview is brought to a logical close.  
 
Closing Questions 
Closing questions seek to close the interview positively. In routine interviews, closing 
questions serve the following purposes: reconfirm facts, gather additional facts, and 
conclude to interview and maintain goodwill.  
 
Assessment Questions 
If the interviewer has reason to believe the respondent is being deceptive, he should begin 
asking assessment questions. These are questions specifically designed to establish the 
respondent’s credibility. When assessing credibility, the interviewer must observe the 
subject’s verbal and nonverbal responses. By observing the verbal and nonverbal responses 
of the respondent to these questions, the interviewer can assess the respondent’s credibility 
with some degree of accuracy. That assessment will form the basis of the interviewer’s 
decision about whether to pose admission-seeking questions to obtain a legal admission  
of wrongdoing.  
 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.204   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Admission-Seeking Questions 
The choice of when to conduct an admission-seeking interview of a suspect is critical. 
Admission-seeking interviews are reserved specifically for individuals whose culpability is 
reasonably certain; all other reasonable investigative steps have been completed and as much 
information as possible has been developed from other sources; and the interviewer can 
reasonably control the place, time, and subject matter of the interview.  
 
Admission-seeking questions serve at least two purposes: (1) to clear an innocent person or 
(2) to encourage the culpable person to confess. However, the interviewer must be careful to 
pose these questions in a way that does not violate the rights and privileges of the person 
being interviewed. 
 
 
Legal Considerations When Conducting an Interview 
Interviews, and especially admission-seeking interviews, may expose the company and the 
fraud examiner to certain legal risks. Thus, before engaging in an interview, fraud examiners 
must understand the ramifications of their actions. This requires an understanding of certain 
legal issues and how they limit or affect the ways in which an interview may be conducted. 
However, because employee rights vary from case to case, fraud examiners should always 
consult with an attorney regarding the specific laws and regulations for their state or locality. 
 
Legal Authority to Conduct Interviews 
In most instances, legal authority is not required to interview people or to inquire into 
matters. The federal constitution gives any citizen the authority to inquire into virtually any 
subject area, as long as the rights of individuals are not transgressed in the process. 
Generally, no license is required to conduct interviews; however, if the interviewer 
represents himself as an investigator, some states require a license. 
 
False Imprisonment 
False imprisonment is the restraint by one person of the physical liberty of another without 
consent or legal justification. In the context of employee interviews, a claim of false 
imprisonment may be made if the interviewer locks the interview room, stands in front of 
the exit, or refuses to let the suspect leave.  
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.205 
Use of Deception in Interviews 
Surprisingly, the use of deception to gain information can sometimes be employed legally. 
The theory is that information can be obtained by nearly any means, with the exception of 
force or threats. The interviewer, however, might not employ any deception likely to cause 
an innocent person to confess. The use of deception is not justified regarding promises of 
leniency, promises of confidentiality, or to obtain a monetary or business advantage. 
 
Frazier v. Cupp  
In Frazier v. Cupp, 394 U.S. 731 (1961), the U.S. Supreme Court indirectly recognized the 
necessity of using deception during interviews. In this case, the suspect confessed to a 
homicide after the interrogator falsely told him that his alleged accomplice had confessed to 
the crime. On appeal, the Supreme Court ruled that the deception alone was insufficient to 
invalidate the confession.  
 
Recording Interviews 
In some circumstances, recording an interview might be illegal. Both state and federal law 
limit an employer’s right to record employee interviews during an investigation. In fact, in 
some states, audio recording an interview is permitted only with the consent of all parties to 
the communication. Thus, fraud examiners should always consult with an attorney when 
deciding whether to record an interview.  
 
If recording an interview without the respondent’s consent is legal, consider tape recording 
the interview covertly. Covertly recording offers an advantage in that it provides an accurate 
record without disturbing the flow of the interview. If there is to be a covert tape recording 
and the subject asks if the interview is being recorded, do not lie. Explain that it is in the 
subject’s best interest that an accurate recording be made and that he can have a copy when 
completed. 
  
 
Elements of Conversations 
Since an interview is essentially a structured conversation, it is helpful to understand the 
basic elements of communications. Whenever two or more human beings are conversing, 
several types of communication occur — either one at a time or in combination.  
 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.206   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Expression 
A common function of conversation is self-expression. One or more of the 
conversationalists might need to express ideas, feelings, attitudes, or moods. The illusion of 
an audience is central to a personal expression. The urge for spontaneous expression can be 
a vital asset in interviewing, and it should be encouraged in the respondent. It can be 
directed by the interviewer toward information-gathering objectives, but the interviewer 
should not give way to the urge for personal self-expression. 
 
One of the most common errors made by novice interviewers is to yield to the temptation to 
impress the respondent with their knowledge of the subject of the interview. In doing so, 
interviewers run the risk of making the respondent feel threatened, with the resultant 
tendency for respondents to guard responses rather than express their feelings frankly. 
Experienced interviewers will have the discipline to control their own responses. 
 
Persuasion 
The concepts of persuasion and expression differ in that persuasion is essentially aimed at 
convincing the other person. There are times when persuasion can be used effectively in the 
interview. This is mostly through convincing the person of the legitimacy of the interview. 
 
Therapy 
Making people feel good about themselves is often a function of conversation. In an 
ordinary conversation with a friend, a person often expresses ideas and feelings to remove 
emotional tension. This release is called catharsis, and is encouraged, for example, in 
psychiatric interviews. There are many times when the information sought in an interview is 
closely related to the respondent’s inner conflicts and tensions. For example, in the area of 
fraud, a person embezzling money from the company will typically feel guilty. A skillful 
interviewer will know the therapeutic implication of such a feeling when attempting to 
develop information.  
 
Ritual 
Some aspects of conversation are ritualistic; that is, they are merely a form of verbal behavior 
that has no real significance other than to provide security in interpersonal relations. 
Examples include “Good Morning!” and “How are you today?” In interviewing, we must 
learn to detect ritualistic answers by the respondent, and avoid giving them ourselves. The 
interviewer must be aware of the danger of engaging in ritualistic conversation and then 
confusing the results with valid information.  
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.207 
Information Exchange  
Information exchange is the central purpose of the interview. The word exchange reminds us 
that the flow of information in an interview goes both ways. Too frequently, interviewers 
become so concerned with the information they wish to obtain that they do not properly 
exchange information with the respondent. Although details of what the interviewer says 
should be carefully measured, don’t be cagey.  This tactic rarely works. Two basic problems 
occur in the exchange of information. First, the information sought by the interviewer is not 
of equal importance to the respondent. Second, there is often a communication barrier 
between people of diverse backgrounds. These barriers are common between people who 
don’t know one another.  
 
 
Inhibitors of Communication 
To be an effective interviewer, one must understand that certain matters inhibit 
communication, while others facilitate it. It is the interviewer’s task to minimize inhibitors 
and maximize facilitators. An inhibitor is any social-psychological barrier that impedes the 
flow of relevant information by making the respondent unable or unwilling to provide the 
information to the interviewer. Eight inhibitors to communication are listed below. The first 
four tend to make the respondent unwilling; the last four make the respondent unable to 
give the information, even though willing.  
 
Competing Demands for Time 
The respondent might hesitate to begin an interview because of other time demands. The 
subject does not necessarily place a negative value on being interviewed, but weighs the value 
of being interviewed against doing something else. The successful interviewer must convince 
the respondent that the interview is a good use of time.  
 
Ego Threat 
The respondent in some cases might withhold information because of a perceived threat to 
his self-esteem. There are three broad categories of ego threats: repression, disapproval, and 
loss of status. 
 
Repression 
The strongest ego threat is repression. Respondents might not only refuse to admit 
information to the interviewer, they might also refuse to admit the information inwardly. 
They are being honest when answering that they do not know or that they have forgotten. 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.208   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Embezzlers, for example, might repress memory of the act because it does not conform to 
their moral code.  
 
Disapproval 
A less intense but more common effect of ego threat is found when respondents possess 
information but are hesitant to admit it because they anticipate disapproval from the 
interviewer. If respondents are made to feel that the interviewer will not condemn them, 
they might welcome the opportunity to divulge information. A generally accepting and 
sympathetic attitude toward the respondent goes far toward eliciting candid responses.  
 
Loss of Status 
Sometimes respondents fear losing status if the information provided becomes public. This 
can sometimes be overcome by the interviewer’s assurance that the information will be 
handled confidentially. 
 
Etiquette 
The etiquette barrier operates when an answer to the interviewer’s question contains 
information perceived by the respondent as inappropriate. Answering candidly would be 
considered in poor taste or evidence of a lack of proper etiquette. For example, there are 
certain things that men do not discuss in front of women and vice versa, things that students 
do not tell teachers, and things that doctors do not tell patients. The desire to avoid 
embarrassing, shocking, or threatening answers is distinct from the fear of exposing oneself. 
Often, the negative effects of the etiquette barrier might be forestalled by selecting the 
appropriate interviewer and setting for the interview.  
 
Trauma 
Trauma denotes an acutely unpleasant feeling associated with crisis experiences. The 
unpleasant feeling is often brought to the surface when the respondent is reporting the 
experience. Trauma is common when talking to victims, and can usually be overcome by 
sensitive handling of the issue.  
 
Forgetting 
A frequent inhibitor to communication is the respondent’s inability to recall certain types of 
information. This is not a problem if the objectives of the interview deal only with current 
attitudes, beliefs, or expectations. The natural fading of the memory over time makes it 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.209 
easier for the ego-defense system to reconstruct one’s own image of the past by omission, 
addition, or distortion.  
 
The memory problem is a much more frequent obstacle than is generally expected by 
interviewers. Even some of the most simple and obvious facts cannot be elicited because of 
the respondent’s memory problems. There are three factors that contribute to recollection of 
an event. 
 
First, the vividness of the person’s recall is related to the event’s original emotional impact, 
its meaningfulness at the time, and the degree to which the person’s ego is involved. A 
second factor is the amount of time that has elapsed since the event. Third is the nature of 
the interview situation, including the interviewer’s techniques and tactics.  
 
Knowledge of these factors will help the inter viewer anticipate problems that might occur. 
And there are certain techniques, discussed later, that will help the interviewer overcome 
many of these memory problems.  
 
Chronological Confusion 
Chronological confusion is commonly encountered in interviews seeking case history 
information. This term refers to the respondent’s tendency to confuse the order of 
experiences and can occur in two ways: two or more events might be correctly recalled, but 
the respondent is unsure of the sequence, or only one event might be recalled, and it is 
incorrectly assumed to have been true at an earlier point. 
 
Inferential Confusion 
Inferential confusion denotes confusion and inaccuracies resulting from errors of inference. 
These errors generally fall into two categories: induction or deduction. Induction occurs when 
the respondent is asked to convert concrete experiences into a higher level of generalization. 
Deduction occurs when the respondent is asked to give concrete examples of certain 
categories of experience. 
 
Unconscious Behavior 
Often the interview process reveals information about a person’s unconscious behavior. 
There are three types of unconscious behavior: customs or habits, circular reactions, and 
reactions to acute emotional crises. A custom or habit is a settled tendency or usual pattern of 
behavior; it is the behavior that an individual engages in regularly. A circular reaction  is the 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.210   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
immediate, unwitting response of one person to the subliminal, nonverbal clues of another. 
A response to an acute emotional crisis does not follow a habitual pattern or result from a 
reaction to others. It arises only in special circumstances when the interviewee is 
experiencing an emotional dilemma.  
 
 
Facilitators of Communication 
Facilitators of communication are those social-psychological forces that make conversations, 
including interviews, easier to accomplish. These facilitators require a basic understanding of 
what motivates people.  
 
Fulfilling Expectations 
One of the important forces in social interaction is the tendency of one person to 
communicate, verbally or nonverbally, his expectations to the other person. The second 
person then tends to respond, consciously or unconsciously, to those expectations. This 
might be viewed as one manifestation of the more general human tendency to conform to 
the group and to the anticipations of higher-status people. It is in this conformity to group 
norms that security is sought. 
 
In the interview setting, the interviewer communicates expectations to the respondent. The 
interviewer should be able to transmit both a general expectation of cooperation and a more 
specific expectation that the respondent will answer the questions truthfully. The interviewer 
must clearly distinguish between asking for information and expecting it. The former is 
mainly achieved with verbal communication, while the latter is accomplished through 
nonverbal behavior. The interviewer who expects the respondent to cooperate will likely be 
more successful than one who only asks questions.  
 
Recognition 
All human beings need the recognition and the esteem of others. Social interaction often 
depends on an exchange of social goods. People will “perform” in exchange for recognition 
and other social rewards. The need for recognition can be fulfilled by attention from people 
outside the individual’s social circle. The skillful and insightful interviewer takes advantage of 
every opportunity to give the respondent sincere recognition.  
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.211 
Altruistic Appeals 
There seems to be a need for humans to identify with some higher value or cause beyond 
immediate self-interest. This might sometimes take the form of identification with the 
objectives of a larger group. Altruistic deeds usually increase self-esteem, whether or not the 
deeds have been made public. This distinguishes altruism from publicity. Altruism is of 
major importance in motivating many respondents. Interviewers who understand the 
respondent’s value system can use strategy and techniques that appeal to altruism.  
 
Sympathetic Understanding 
Human beings need the sympathetic response of others. They like to share their joys, fears, 
successes, and failures. This need for understanding differs from the need for recognition 
that requires success and increased status. Interviewers who reflect a sympathetic attitude 
and who know how to direct that attitude toward the objectives of the interview will find 
their percentages of success much higher than those who do not.  
 
New Experience 
People welcome new experiences. Although variety might not be the only spice of life, 
escape from the dreary routine is sought by everyone. Sometimes the respondent is 
motivated by curiosity regarding the interviewer. Interviewers should consider this when 
deciding what to say about themselves. One must not assume that just because an interview 
is a new experience, it will satisfy the respondent’s needs. Aspects of the respondent’s 
perception of the new experience can be ego threatening. The respondent might be anxious 
about the impression left with the interviewer. This apprehensiveness can often be detected 
by the interviewer at the beginning of the contact. Once these fears are dispelled, the 
respondent frequently finds the interview a new and interesting experience.  
 
Catharsis 
Catharsis is the process by which a person obtains a release from unpleasant emotional 
tensions by talking about the source of these tensions. We often feel better by talking about 
something that upsets us. Although we are all familiar with the frequent necessity for 
catharsis in ourselves, we do not always perceive the same need in others. The need for 
sympathetic understanding and the need for catharsis are related, but they are not the same 
thing. The interviewer who does not have time to listen to what he considers inconsequential 
or egocentric talk will often find the respondent unwilling to share important consequences.  
 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.212   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Need for Meaning 
Another general trait common to people is the need for meaning. Every society has a set of 
assumptions, values, explanations, and myths lending order to the society. The concept of 
need for meaning is related to cognitive dissonance. Psychological tension is created when an 
individual becomes aware of incongruence of facts, assumptions, and interpretations. This 
tension is painful, and its reduction is rewarding to the individual. In cases where the 
interview topic deals directly with the sources disturbing a person’s system of meaning, there 
is a strong motivation for the respondent to talk it through, if he is convinced of the 
interviewer’s interest.  
 
Extrinsic Rewards 
Extrinsic rewards are rewards the interviewee receives that are not directly related to the 
interview experience, and they cause the respondent to see the interview as a means to an 
end. Extrinsic rewards for interviewees can include money, job advancement, and retention 
of privileges. What is irrelevant to the interviewer might not be to the respondent. A 
sensitive interviewer will be able to recognize what extrinsic rewards the respondent receives, 
if any, from being interviewed.  
 
 
Interview Mechanics 
As with all other phases of a fraud examination, an interview will be most successful if the 
investigator is thoroughly prepared, which requires that the interviewer understands the 
mechanics of interviewing.  
 
Note-Taking 
The interviewer will frequently need to take notes during the interview. Start each interview 
on a separate sheet of paper. This procedure can be especially helpful should documents 
from a particular interview be subpoenaed. Do not try to write down all the information you 
are given during an interview, only the pertinent facts. Taking too many notes will make the 
interview process cumbersome and might inhibit the respondent. If a quote is particularly 
relevant, try to write it down verbatim. Enclose all direct quotes in quotation marks. 
 
Do not slow down the interview process for note taking. Instead, jot down key words or 
phrases, and then go back over the details at the end of the interview. In general, it is better 
to err on the side of taking too few notes rather than too many. 
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.213 
Maintain Eye Contact 
The interviewer should maintain eye contact with the respondent as much as possible during 
note taking. Just as eye contact personalizes all human communication, it creates a more 
comfortable environment and facilitates the flow of information during the interview 
process. 
 
Opinions 
Avoid making notes regarding your overall opinions or impressions of a witness. Such notes 
can cause you problems with your credibility if they are later produced in court. Be careful 
not to show excitement when taking notes. During interviews of targets and adverse 
witnesses, take notes in a manner that does not indicate the significance of the information; 
that is, never allow note taking to “telegraph” your emotions. 
 
Writing Down Questions 
Whenever possible, do not write down a list of interview questions. Let the interview flow 
freely. Inadvertently allowing the respondent to read a written list of questions can provide 
an opportunity to fabricate an answer. However, writing down key points the interviewer 
wants to discuss might be appropriate. 
 
Documenting Results  
Expound the notes from the results of questioning as soon as possible after concluding the 
interview — preferably immediately afterward. If this procedure is followed, the examiner will 
not have to take copious notes during the interview. Law enforcement officials are generally 
required to maintain notes. In the private sector, the notes can usually be destroyed once a 
memorandum has been prepared summarizing the interview. (See the Law section of the 
Fraud Examiners Manual  for more information.) 
 
 
Introductory Questions 
One of the most difficult aspects of an inter view is getting started. Indeed, the introduction 
might be the hardest part. The interviewer and the respondent, in many instances, have not 
met before. The interviewer has a tall order: meet the person, state a reason for the 
interview, establish necessary rapport, and get the information. The introduction is 
accomplished through questions as opposed to statements. The questions allow the 
interviewer to assess feedback from the respondent. This is an important aspect of the 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.214   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
introduction. If the respondent is reluctant to be interviewed, that fact will come out  
through the introductory questions.  
  
Four Objectives 
Introductory questions are designed to meet the four objectives below.  
 
Provide the Introduction 
Obviously, the interviewer must introduce himself before the interview commences. The 
interviewer should generally indicate his name and company, avoiding titles. This is not 
always the case, but the more informal the interview, generally the more relaxed  
the respondent. 
 
Establish Rapport 
Webster’s defines rapport as a “relation marked by harmony, conformity, accord, or affinity.” 
In other words, there must be some common ground established before questioning begins. 
This is usually accomplished by the interviewer spending a few minutes with the respondent 
in “small talk.” This aspect, however, should not be overdone. Most people are aware that 
the interviewer is there for a meaningful purpose and not to chitchat.  
 
Establish the Interview Theme 
The interviewer must state the purpose of the interview in some way prior to the 
commencement of serious questioning. Otherwise, the respondent might be confused, 
threatened, or overly cautious. Stating the purpose of the interview is known as establishing 
the interview theme. 
 
Additionally, the purpose of the interview should be general and not specific. The specific 
interview purpose will be conveyed to the respondent later. The stated purpose of the 
interview should be one that is logical for the respondent to accept and easy for the 
interviewer to explain, but it might be related only indirectly to the actual purpose of the 
interview. Normally, the more general the theme is the better.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“I am working on a matter and I need your help.” 
OR 
“I am doing a review of procedures here at the company.” 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.215 
OR 
“I am developing some information on our purchasing procedures.” 
 
The goal of the theme is to get the respondent to make a commitment for assistance. Failure 
to get a commitment to assist from the respondent is one of the common mistakes made 
even by experienced interviewers. This is a critical step in setting the tone for the interview. 
A commitment of assistance requires positive action on the part of the person being 
interviewed. Remaining silent or simply nodding the head is generally not sufficient. 
  
The interviewer should ask for the commitment before the interview commences, and 
should encourage the respondent to voice that “yes” aloud. If the interviewer encounters 
silence the first time, the question should be repeated in a slightly different way until the 
respondent verbalizes commitment. In the Linda Reed Collins case, included in the 
Appendix to this section, Bridges, the Certified Fraud Examiner, introduces himself to Mary 
Rodriguez De La Garza, who works in the purchasing department of Bailey Books 
Incorporated. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Ms. De La Garza, I’m Loren Bridges. I’m doing a review of our purchasing function. Do 
you have a few minutes?” 
 
Respondent: 
“ Yes.” 
 
Interviewer: 
“I am gathering some information on certain company procedures. Maybe you can help me?” 
 
Respondent: 
No response. 
 
Interviewer: 
“Could I get you to help me, if you can?” 
 
Respondent : 
“Yes. What’s this about?” 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.216   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Generally, the most effective interview theme is that help is being sought. Nearly all human 
beings get satisfaction from helping others. Thus, in most interviews, the interviewer should 
approach the respondent so that person is made to feel important in helping out.  
 
During this phase of the interview, the respondent must not feel threatened in any way. An 
effective approach is the “Columbo style” (although perhaps not in such a rumpled way), in 
which at least two thoughts go through the mind of Columbo’s subjects: (1) he is no threat 
to me, and (2) he really needs my help. 
 
In the following examples, the interviewer is introducing himself to a fellow employee. 
 
EXAMPLE 
WRONG 
Interviewer: 
“Ms. De La Garza, I am Loren Bridges, a Certified Fraud Examiner with Bailey Books’ 
fraud examination unit. I am investigating a case of suspected fraud, and you might know 
something about it. How long have you worked here at the company?” 
 
RIGHT 
Interviewer : 
“Ms. De La Garza, I am Loren Bridges. I work here at the company. Have we met before?” 
 
Respondent: 
“I don’t think so.” 
 
Interviewer : 
“I am working on an assignment and I need your help. Do you have a few minutes I can spend 
with you?” 
 
Observe Reactions 
The interviewer must be skilled in interpreting the respondent’s reactions to questions. Social 
scientists say that more than half of the communication between individuals is nonspoken. 
The interviewer must, therefore, observe systematically, though in a nondescript manner, the 
various responses the respondent gives during the course of the conversation.  
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.217 
To observe the respondent’s reactions, move from nonsensitive to sensitive questions. That 
is, the interview process should begin by posing nonsensitive questions while establishing 
rapport. Asking nonsensitive questions will help the interviewer find some common ground 
on which to connect with the respondent.  
 
Sensitive questions should be scrupulously avoided until well into the interview. And then 
such questions should be asked only after careful deliberation and planning. Moreover, all 
questions should be nonaccusatory. Nothing closes up the lines of communication in an 
interview like an accusatory question. If the respondent starts to become uncomfortable with 
the questioning, the interviewer should move into a different area and approach the sensitive 
question later from a different vantage point. 
 
Likewise, interviewers are encouraged to formulate their questions in a way that will not 
bring about a strong emotional reaction from the respondent, and emotive words of all types 
should be avoided during the introductory phase. Such words put people on the defensive, 
and they are more reluctant to answer and to cooperate. 
 
EXAMPLE 
 
Instead of Use  
Investigation Inquiry

Furthermore, some people will not volunteer information; they must be asked. The 
interviewer must not be reluctant to ask sensitive questions after the proper basis has been 
established. If the interviewer poses the question with confidence and with the attitude that 
an answer is expected, the respondent will be much more likely to furnish the requested 
information. If the interviewer is apologetic or lacks confidence in the question, the 
respondent is much less likely to answer. 
 
After the interviewer establishes rapport through normal conversation, the respondent’s 
reactions are observed. This will serve as a baseline for observing behavior when questions 
that are more sensitive are asked. If the respondent’s verbal and nonverbal behaviors are 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.218   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
inconsistent from one type of question to another, the interviewer will attempt to determine 
why.  
 
To determine why the respondent’s behaviors are inconsistent, the interviewer must be 
knowledgeable about nonverbal clues of behavior, which generally fall within one of the 
following categories: proxemics, chr onemics, kinetics, or paralinguistics. 
 
PROXEMICS 
Proxemic communication is the use of interpersonal space to convey meaning. The relationship 
between the interviewer and respondent is both a cause and effect of proxemic behavior. If 
the distance between the interviewer and the respondent is greater, there is more of a 
tendency for them to watch each other’s eyes for clues to meaning.  
 
It is important to position the respondent’s chair and the interviewer’s chair at an acceptable 
distance. The correct conversational distance varies from one culture to another. In the 
Middle East, the distance is quite short; in Latin America, equals of the same sex carry on a 
conversation at a much closer distance than in North America. Often, as the subject matter 
of the interview changes, the interviewer can note the changes in the proxemic behavior of 
the respondent. If the person is free to back away, he might do so when the topic becomes 
unpleasant or sensitive.  
 
CHRONEMICS 
Chronemic communication refers to the use of time in interpersonal relationships to convey 
meaning, attitudes, and desires. If the respondent is late in keeping an appointment, for 
example, this might convey a lack of interest in or an avoidance of the interview.  
 
The most important chronemic technique used by interviewers is in the timing of questions. 
The interviewer can control the length of pauses and the rate of his speech. This is called 
pacing. The interviewer can also control the length of time after the respondent has finished a 
sentence before another question is posed. This is called the silent probe. 
 
Pacing is one of the principal nonverbal methods of setting an appropriate mood. The tense 
interviewer often communicates anxiety by a rapid-fire rate of speech, which in turn might 
increase anxiety in the respondent. To establish the more thoughtful, deliberative mood 
usually needed to stimulate free association, the interviewer must take the initiative in setting 
a more relaxed, deliberate pace. 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.219 
KINETICS 
Kinetic communication involves the use of body movement to convey meaning. Even though 
posture, hands, and feet all communicate, interviewers tend to focus attention on the face 
and are more accurate in their judgments of others if they can see facial movements and 
expressions. When the interviewer concentrates on facial expressions, the primary interest is 
eye contact. Eye contact primarily communicates the desire to make or avoid 
communication. A person who feels shame normally will drop the eyes to avoid the glance 
of another. This is not only to avoid seeing disapproval, but to conceal personal shame  
and confusion. 
 
PARALINGUISTICS 
Paralinguistic communication involves the use of volume, pitch, and voice quality to convey 
meaning. One of the basic differences between  written and verbal communication is that 
oral speech gives the full range of nonverbal accompaniment. For example, a “yes” response 
might not mean complete agreement; it depends on the way in which the “yes” is said. 
 
The interviewer must learn to listen and observe changes in the nonverbal accompaniment 
and whether the verbal and nonverbal are harmoniously reinforcing or tend to give 
conflicting signals, as in cases where the respondent is trying to deceive the interviewer. Ten 
emotions have been studied by social scientists: anger, fear, happiness, jealousy, love, 
nervousness, pride, sadness, satisfaction, and sympathy. Some emotions, like anger and 
nervousness, can be more reliably identified than the others. 
 
Methodology 
Respondents must perceive that they have something in common with the interviewer, and 
should feel good about the situation. This is best accomplished when respondents perceive 
the interviewer as being open and friendly. The following techniques promote this 
perception. 
 
Physical Contact 
Make physical contact with the person being interviewed by shaking hands. Making  
physical contact helps break down psychological barriers to communication. The interviewer 
should not invade the respondent’s personal space, however, as this might make the  
person uncomfortable. 
 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.220   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
The interviewer uses body language to create the impression of trust during the interview by 
gesturing openly with the arms, clasping hands together, and leaning forward in a manner to 
indicate interest. Rapport can be established through verbal techniques, such as using soft 
words, agreeing with the respondent, and avoiding negative terms. 
 
When contacting a respondent for the first time, the interviewer must identify himself. This 
is best accomplished by stating your name. Unless a specific reason exists, the interviewer 
should generally omit a title. The less formality in general, the better. In some instances, 
stating a title cannot be avoided. In those cases, the title used should not conjure up emotion 
or possible fear in the mind of the respondent.  
 
Don’t Interview More Than One Person 
One of the basic rules is to question only one person at a time. The testimony of one 
respondent will invariably influence the testimony of another. There are few hard and fast 
rules, but this is one of them.  
 
Privacy 
Another basic rule is to conduct interviews under conditions of privacy. The interview is 
best conducted out of the sight and sound of friends, relatives, or fellow employees. People 
are very reluctant to furnish information within the hearing of others. 
 
Establish Transitional Statement 
Once the interviewer has a commitment for assistance, he must describe in more detail the 
purpose of the interview. This is done with the transitional statement used to provide a 
legitimate basis for the inquiry and to explain to respondents how they fit into the inquiry. 
This is usually done by means of a broad description. When interviewing employees in the 
same company, most of them already presume the legitimacy of your request for assistance. 
After describing the basic nature of the inquiry with the transitional statement, the 
interviewer should seek a second commitment for assistance. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“It’s pretty routine, really. I’m gathering some information about the purchasing function and 
how it is supposed to work. It would be helpful to me if I could start by asking you to tell me 
about your job. Okay?” 
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.221 
When interviewing strangers, the interviewer might have to describe with more particularity 
how the respondent’s assistance is needed. This can be accomplished by one or more of the 
methods illustrated below, where the interviewer is talking to an outside vendor. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“ It’s pretty routine, really. As I say, I work for Bailey Books and I’ve been assigned a project 
to gather some information about some of our procedures. And because you work for one of our 
vendors, I thought it might be helpful to talk to you. Okay ?” 
OR 
“It’s pretty routine, really. I have been asked by the company to gather information on some of 
our procedures. I thought you might be able to help by answering a few questions. Okay?” 
OR 
“ It’s pretty routine, really. I have been asked by the company to gather some information, and 
they suggested I might contact you. Okay?” 
 
Seek Continuous Agreement 
Throughout the interview process — from the introduction to the close — the interviewer 
should attempt to phrase questions so that they can be answered “yes.” It is easier for people 
to reply in the affirmative than the negative. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer : 
“Okay?” 
 
“Can you help me?” 
 
“That’s okay, isn’t it?” 
 
Do Not Invade Body Space 
During the introductory part of the interview, the interviewer generally should remain at a 
distance of four to six feet. Do not invade the personal zone (closer than about three feet), 
as it might make the respondent uncomfortable.  
 
 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.222   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Informational Questions 
Informational questions are nonconfrontational, nonthreatening, and are asked for 
information-gathering purposes. The great majority of the interviewer’s questions fall into 
this category. These types of questions may be asked during any of the following types of 
interviews: 
• Interviews to gain an understanding of accounting control systems 
• Interviews concerning documents 
• Interviews to gather information regarding business operations or systems 
• Pre-employment interviews 
  
Informational questions seek to elicit unbiased factual information. The interviewer will be 
alert to inconsistency in facts or behavior.  
 
Question Sequences 
As a general rule, questioning should proceed from the general to the specific; that is, it is 
best to seek general information before seeking details. A variation is to “reach backward” 
with the questions, by beginning with known information and working toward unknown 
areas. An efficient method of doing this is to recount the known information and then frame 
the next question as a logical continuation of the facts previously related. 
 
It is common, especially in accounting and fraud-related matters, for figures or numbers to 
be critical. Unfortunately, some witnesses are unable to recall specific amounts. The 
interviewer can jog the memory of the respondent by comparing unknown items with items 
of known quantity. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer : 
“Was the amount of money involved more than last year’s figure?” 
 
Questioning Techniques 
Asking the right question is necessary to conduct an effective interview. By using the right 
questions, the interviewer can improve a whole range of communications skills. 
Informational questions — as well as others — fall into several general categories. But 
generally, informational questions will be one of three types: open, closed, or leading. 
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.223 
Open Questions 
Open questions are those worded in a way that makes it difficult to answer “yes” or “no.” 
The answer is also not dependent on the question. The typical open question calls for a 
monologue response, and it can be answered in several different ways. During the 
information phase of the interview, the interviewer should endeavor to ask primarily  
open questions. This is to stimulate conversation. Some of the best open questions are 
subtle commands. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Please tell me about your job.” 
 
“Please tell me about the operation of your department.” 
 
“What do you think about this problem?” 
 
“Please describe the procedures to me.” 
 
Closed Questions 
Closed questions are those that require a precise answer: usually “yes” or “no.” Closed 
questions also deal with specifics, such as amounts, dates, and times. As far as possible, 
closed questions should be avoided in the informational part of the interview. They are used 
extensively in closing questions. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer : 
“Do you work here?” 
 
“What day of the week did it happen?” 
 
Leading Questions 
Leading questions contain the answer as a part of the question. Most commonly, they are 
used to confirm facts already known. This type of question gives the subject much less room 
to maneuver than an open or closed question because they direct the subject to answer in a 
particular way. Leading questions imply that the interviewer already knows the answer, 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.224   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
asking the subject to confirm what is already known, and they can be particularly effective in 
interview situations. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer : 
“So there have been no changes in the operation since last year?” 
 
“Are you still employed by the Bailey Books Corporation?” 
 
“You got promoted, right?” 
 
“Don’t you get your income from various sources?” 
 
Double-Negative Questions 
Questions or statements containing double-negatives are confusing and often suggest an 
answer opposite to the correct one. They should not be used. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Didn’t you suspect that something wasn’t right?” (What does a negative answer  
mean here?)  
 
Complex Questions 
Complex questions and statements are too complicated to be easily understood, cover more 
than one subject or topic, require more than one answer, and/or require a complicated 
answer. They should be avoided. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“What are your duties here, and ho w long have you been employed?” 
 
Attitude Questions 
The attitude of the interviewer can be conveyed by the structure of the question or 
statement, and by the manner in which the question is asked. When the interviewer wishes 
to establish a friendly mood, these questions can be employed. 
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.225 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“How are you doing this morning, Ms. De La Garza?” 
 
“Do you like sports?” 
 
It is always a good idea, however, to ask a question for which you know beforehand 
that the answer will be “yes.”  
 
Controlled Answer Techniques 
Controlled answer techniques or statements might be used to stimulate a desired answer or 
impression. These techniques direct the interview toward a specific point. For example, it 
might be possible to get a person to admit knowledge of a matter by phrasing the question 
like this, “I understand you were present when the internal controls were developed; would you please describe 
how they were constructed?” This phrasing provides a stronger incentive for the respondent to 
admit knowledge than does, “Were you present when the internal controls were developed?” 
 
To stimulate the person to agree to talk or provide information, you might use a prompt, 
such as, “Because you are not involved in this matter, I am sure you would not mind discussing it with me.” 
This provides a stronger incentive to cooperate than, “Do you have any objections to telling me 
what you know?” Avoid negative construction, such as, “I don’t guess you would mind answering a 
few questions?” 
 
Free Narratives 
The free narrative is an orderly, continuous account of an event or incident, given with or 
without prompting. It is used to get a quick résumé of what is known about a matter. Be 
sure to designate specifically the occurrence that you wish to discuss. 
 
Sometimes the respondent must be controlled to prevent unnecessary digression. Otherwise, 
use a minimum of interruptions, and do not stop the narrative without good reason. The 
respondent will sometimes provide valuable clues when talking about things that are only 
partially related to the matter under inquiry. 
 
Suggestions 
Below are suggestions to improve the quality of the interview during the information-gathering 
phase. 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.226   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• Begin by asking questions that are not likely to cause the respondent to become 
defensive or hostile. 
• Ask the questions in a manner that will develop the facts in the order of their 
occurrence, or in some other systematic order. 
• Ask only one question at a time, and frame the question so that only one answer  
is required. 
• Ask straightforward and frank questions; generally avoid shrewd approaches. 
• Give the respondent ample time to answer; do not rush. 
• Try to help the respondent remember, but do not suggest answers; and be careful not to 
imply any particular answer by facial expressions, gestures, methods of asking questions, 
or types of questions asked. 
• Repeat or rephrase questions, if necessary, to get the desired facts. 
• Be sure you understand the answers, and if they are not perfectly clear, have the 
respondent interpret them at the time instead of asking for more explanation later. 
• Give the respondent an opportunity to qualify his answers. 
• Separate facts from inferences. 
• Have the respondent give comparisons by percentages, fractions, estimates of time and 
distance, and other such comparisons to ascertain accuracy. 
• Get all of the facts; almost every respondent can give you information beyond what was 
initially provided. 
• After the respondent has given a narrative account, ask questions about every item that 
has been discussed. 
• Upon conclusion of the direct questioning, ask the respondent to summarize the 
information given. Then summarize the facts as you understand them, and have the 
respondent verify that these conclusions are correct. 
 
Methodology  
Once the introduction has been completed, the interviewer needs a transition into the body 
of the interview. This is usually accomplished by asking people an easy question about 
themselves or their duties.  
  
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.227 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“As I said, I am informally gathering information about Bailey’s operations. I don’t know if 
you can really help me. Can you give me an idea of what you do here?” 
 
Begin with Background Questions 
Assuming the respondent does not have a problem answering the transitional question, the 
interviewer should then ask a series of easy, open questions designed to get the respondent 
to talk about himself. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“What is your exact title?” 
 
“What do your responsibilities involve?” 
 
“How long have you been assigned here?” 
 
“What do you like best about your job?” 
 
“What do you like least about your job?” 
 
“What would you eventually like to do for the company?” 
 
“Overall, how do you like your current job?” 
 
Observe Verbal and Nonverbal Behavior 
During the period when the respondent is talking about himself, the interviewer should 
discreetly observe verbal and nonverbal behavior. 
 
Ask Nonleading (Open) Questions 
Open questioning techniques are used almost exclusively in the informational phase of the 
interview. The questions must be inquisitory and not accusatory. Remember, the most 
effective question is constructed as a subtle command. 
  
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.228   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Please tell me about ________.” 
 
“Please tell me about your current job procedures.” 
 
“Please tell me what paperwork you are responsible for.” 
 
“Please explain the chain of command in your department.” 
 
“Please tell me what procedures are in effect to prevent errors in the paperwork.” 
 
“Please explain what you understand to be the system of checks and balances (or internal 
controls) in your department.” 
 
“Please explain where you see areas that need to be improved in the system of checks and 
balances in your department.” 
 
Once the respondent has answered open questions, the interviewer can go back and review 
the facts in greater detail. If the answers are inconsistent, try to clarify them. But the 
interviewer should not challenge the honesty or integrity of the respondent at this point. 
 
Approach Sensitive Questions Carefully  
Words such as “routine questions” can be used to play down the significance of the inquiry. 
It is important for information-gathering purposes that the interviewer does not react 
excessively to the respondent’s statements. The interviewer should not express shock, 
disgust, or similar emotions during the interview. Following are examples of ways to  
discuss fraud within a company. The questions are posed in a hypothetical way to avoid 
being accusatory. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Part of my job is to prevent and uncover waste, fraud, and abuse. You understand that, don’t 
you?” 
  
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.229 
“Please tell me where you think the company is wasting assets or money.” 
 
“Where do you think the company is vulnerable to someone here abusing their position?” 
 
Dealing with Resistance 
There is always the possibility that the respondent will refuse a request for interview. When 
the respondent and the interviewer have no connection, studies show that as many as 65 
percent of the respondents will refuse an interview if contacted first by telephone. In 
contrast, one study concluded that only one-third of respondents will be reluctant to be 
interviewed when contacted in person. The more unpleasant the topic, the more likely the 
respondent is to refuse.  
 
With inexperienced interviewers, there is a danger that the interviewer will perceive 
resistance when there is none. As a result, the interviewer might become defensive. It is 
incumbent upon the interviewer to overcome such feelings to complete the interview. The 
following are specific examples of the types of resistance that will be encountered and how 
to try to overcome them. 
 
“I’m Too Busy” 
When the interviewer contacts the respondent without a previous appointment, there is a 
possibility that the respondent will be too busy at the moment to cooperate. “I’m too busy” 
is also used as an excuse for the real source of the person’s resistance, which might be 
lethargy, ego threat, or a dislike of talking to strangers. These situations can be diffused by 
the interviewer stressing that: 
• The interview will be short. 
• The interviewer is already there. 
• The project is important. 
• The interview will not be difficult. 
• The interviewer needs help. 
 
“I Don’t Know Anything About It” 
The interviewer will sometimes get this response immediately after stating the purpose of the 
interview. This resistance is typically diffused by accepting the statement, and then 
responding with a question. For example, if a person says, “I don’t know anything,” a typical 
response would be: 
 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.230   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“I see. What do your duties involve, then?” 
OR 
“Well, that was one of the things I wanted to find out. Do you know about internal controls, 
then?” 
 
“I Don’t Remember” 
Usually, this is not an expression of resistance. Instead, it is an expression of modesty, 
tentativeness, or caution. One of the best ways to respond is to simply remain silent while 
the person is deliberating. He is saying, in effect, “Give me a moment to think.” If this is not 
successful, the best way to counter is to pose an alternate, narrower question. As with other 
symptoms of resistance, the resistance is accepted and diffused, and an alternate question  
is posed. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Mr. McGuire, I understand you might not remember the entire transaction. Do you remember 
if it was more than $10,000?” 
OR 
“It’s okay if you don’t remember the details. Do you remember how it made you react at the 
time?” 
 
“What Do You Mean by That?” 
When the respondent asks this question, it might represent a symptom of mild resistance 
with which the respondent is attempting to shift the attention from himself to the 
interviewer. It also might be a way for the respondent to stall for time while deliberating. Or 
it could be that the respondent is not sure what the interviewer’s question means. The 
interviewer should typically react to such a question by treating it as a mere request for 
clarification. The interviewer should not become defensive; to do so generally will escalate 
the resistance.  
 
Difficult People 
The interviewer will invariably encounter a few difficult people. There are five common-
 sense steps to take with such people.  
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.231 
Don’t React 
Sometimes a respondent will insist on giving the interviewer a “hard time” for no apparent 
reason, though, in reality, there can be a multitude of reasons why the person refuses to 
cooperate. There are three natural reactions for the interviewer verbally assailed by the 
respondent: to strike back, to give in, or to terminate the interview. None of these tactics is 
satisfactory, as none leads to a productive interview. Instead, the interviewer should 
consciously ensure that he does not react to anger with hostility.  
 
Disarm the Person 
A common mistake is to try to reason with an unreceptive person. You must disarm the 
hostile person. The best tactic is surprise. If the person is stonewalling, he expects the 
interviewer to apply pressure; if attacking, the person expects the interviewer to resist. To 
disarm the person, listen, acknowledge the point, and agree wherever you can. 
 
Change Tactics 
In some situations, changing tactics to reduce hostility might be the only viable option. This 
means casting what the respondent says in a form that directs attention back to the problem 
and to the interests of both sides. This normally means asking the respondent what he would 
do to solve the problem. 
 
Make It Easy to Say “Yes” 
In trying to negotiate with difficult people, the usual tactic is for the interviewer to make a 
statement and attempt to get the respondent to agree with it. A better choice is to agree with 
one of the respondent’s statements  and go from there. It is better to break statements into 
smaller ones that would be difficult to disagree with. This helps the difficult person  
save face.  
 
Make It Hard to Say “No” 
One way of making it difficult to say “no” is by asking re ality-based (what-if) questions. 
These types of questions are used to get the respondent to think of the consequences of  
not agreeing.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“What do you think will happen if we don’t agree?” 
 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.232   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
“What do you think I will have to do from here?” 
 
“What will you do?” 
 
Volatile Interviews 
A volatile interview  is one that has the potential to bring about strong emotional reactions in 
the respondent. Typical volatile interviews involve close friends and relatives of a miscreant, 
co-conspirators, and similar individuals. 
 
The personality characteristics of those involved in the volatile interview vary. The types 
listed represent the most common personality characteristics associated with volatile 
interviews. Some individuals, by nature, are resentful of authority figures, such as fraud 
examiners and law enforcement officers. 
 
Friends, relatives, and romantic interests of a target often make for a difficult interview. They 
perceive that the examiner is “out to get” someone close to them.  
 
Physical Symptoms 
In volatile interviews, the individual typically reacts, rather than thinks; and frequently the 
individual is openly hostile to the interviewer. Individuals experiencing heightened emotions 
frequently have a dry mouth and tend to lick their lips and swallow more frequently than 
normal. Throat clearing is also an audible sign of emotion. Restlessness can be indicated by 
fidgeting, shifting in a chair, and foot-tapping. People under emotional stress frequently 
perspire more than normal. 
 
Under stress, a person’s complexion frequently changes. People might look red or flushed, 
or might appear to be pale. During stress, the heart beats more frequently, and a keen 
observer can see the carotid artery actually pulsate. The carotid artery is the large artery on 
each side of the neck. 
 
If an individual in a normal situation maintains eye contact, an avoidance of eye contact 
could indicate that he is under stress. It is important to realize that symptoms are not present 
in all emotional situations.  
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.233 
Other Considerations 
There should be two interviewers involved in potentially volatile situations. This procedure 
provides psychological strength for the interviewers. Additionally, the second person can 
serve as a witness in the event the interview turns bad.  
 
Surprise should be employed in any interview that is considered potentially volatile. In many 
instances, the potentially volatile respondent is unaware that he is going to be questioned, 
and will therefore be off guard. If the interview is not conducted by surprise, the interviewer 
runs the risk of the respondent not showing up, showing up with a witness, or being present 
with counsel. 
 
In a potentially volatile interview, the order of questions should be out of sequence. This is 
to keep the volatile respondent from knowing exactly the nature of the inquiry, and where it 
is leading. Although the interviewer will endeavor to obtain information regarding who, 
what, why, when, where, and how, the order of the questioning will vary from that of other 
interviews. This technique is especially important in situations where the respondent might 
be attempting to protect himself.  
 
The hypothetical question is generally considered to be less threatening, and is, therefore, 
ideally suited for the potentially volatile interview. For example, if you are interviewing Mr. 
Smith regarding Mr. Jones, rather than saying, “Did Mr. Jones do it?” ask, “Is there any reason why 
Mr. Jones would have done it?” 
 
Overcoming Objections 
Volatile witnesses voice numerous objections to being interviewed. Some of the most 
common objections (along with suggested responses) are listed below. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Respondent : 
“I don’t want to be involved.” 
 
Interviewer: 
The interviewer should answer this question by pointing out that he would not be 
there, asking questions, if the respondent were not involved. Point out that you are 
saving the respondent trouble by discussing the matter “informally” (do not say “off 
the record”). 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.234   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Respondent : 
“Why should I talk to you?” 
 
Interviewer: 
The interviewer should answer that he is trying to clear up a problem, and that the 
respondent’s assistance is important. 
 
Respondent : 
“You can’t prove that!” 
 
Interviewer: 
The interviewer should tell the person that he is not trying to prove or disprove; you 
are simply gathering information. 
 
Respondent : 
“ You can’t make me talk!” 
 
Interviewer: 
Tell the person that you are not attempting to make him do anything; you are trying 
to resolve a problem, and would deeply appreciate help.  
 
 
Closing Questions 
In routine, informational interviews, closing the interview on a positive note is a must. 
During interviews, closing questions are asked for the following purposes: to reconfirm 
facts, to gather additional facts, and to conclude the interview.  
 
Reconfirm Facts 
It is not unusual for the interviewer to have misunderstood or misinterpreted statements of 
the respondent. Therefore, to ensure that the interviewer understood the information that 
the witness provided, he should review the key facts during the closing phase of the 
interview. However, the interviewer should not attempt to revisit all the information 
provided by the subject, only the facts that are most relevant.  
 
  
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.235 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Ms. De La Garza, I want to make sure I have my information straight. Let me take a 
minute and summarize what we’ve discussed.” 
 
Go over each of the key facts in summary form. The questions should be closed, so that the 
witness can respond either “yes” or “no.” 
 
Gather Additional Facts 
The closing-questions phase also seeks to obtain facts previously unknown. It provides the 
respondent further opportunity to say whatever they want about the matter at hand.  
If appropriate, the interviewer can ask if there are other documents or witnesses that would 
be helpful to the case. Do not promise confidentiality; instead, say, “I’ll keep your name as quiet 
as possible.” Finally, the interviewer wants to leave the discussion on a positive note.  
 
People being interviewed often do not volunteer additional information regarding other 
witnesses or evidence. The theme, therefore, is to provide the respondent an opportunity to 
furnish further relevant facts or opinions. At the conclusion, attempt to determine which 
facts provided by the respondent are the most relevant. Do not attempt to go over all the 
information a second time.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“You have known Linda Reed Collins eight years, correct?” 
 
“You knew Collins had some financial problems, is that right?” 
 
“You suspected—but didn’t know for sure—th at Collins might have had an improper 
relationship with one of our vendors. Is that correct?” 
 
On absolutely vital facts provided by the respondent, add “Are you sure?”  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“ Ms. De La Garza, are you sure you su spected Ms. Collins falsified invoices?” 
 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.236   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
To obtain additional facts, ask the respondent if there is something else she would like to 
say. This gives the correct impression that the interviewer is interested in all relevant 
information, regardless of which side it favors. Try to actively involve the respondent in 
helping solve the case—“If you were trying to resolve this issue, what would you do?” This 
technique gives the respondent an opportunity to assist the interviewer, and it makes the 
respondent feel like a vital part of the interview. In addition, asking the witness if there is 
anything else they would like to say opens the door for them to provide additional 
information that was not specifically asked for. Similarly, asking the subject if they know of 
someone else whom you might talk to can be helpful and lead to other potential sources  
of information.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Ms. De La Garza, there might be someone else I should talk to. Are there documents 
available that relate to this that we haven’t already discussed? If I keep your name as quiet as 
possible, are there any suggestions you can give me  about whom else I might talk to about this?” 
OR 
“Are there any other documents or evidence I might look for?” 
OR 
“If you were in my shoes, what would you do next?” 
 
Conclude the Interview 
Establishing rapport with the subject is important because it helps ensure future 
cooperation. Ask if the respondent has anything else to say. This gives the respondent one 
final time chance to make any statement. Also ask if the interviewer can call with any 
additional questions. It leaves the door open to additional cooperation. 
 
To maintain good will, it is also a good idea to ask respondents if they have been treated 
fairly. It is especially helpful to ask this when the respondent has not been cooperative, or at 
the conclusion of an admission-seeking interview. The interviewer generally should ask the 
question as if it were perfunctory. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Ms. De La Garza, this is just a standard que stion. Do you feel that I have treated you fairly 
in this interview?” 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.237 
In addition, leave the respondent a business card or a telephone number. Invite the 
respondent to call about anything else relevant.  
 
Also, in some cases, the interviewer should attempt to obtain a commitment that the 
respondent will not discuss the matter. However, this step is not recommended with adverse 
or hostile respondents, it may give them the idea to share the information. Here is an 
example of the proper approach. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“In these kinds of situations, innocent people ca n have their reputation hurt because of rumor 
and innuendo. We don’t want that to happen and neither do you. Therefore, I’d like your 
cooperation. Can I count on you not to discuss this until all the facts are out?” 
 
Finally, the interviewer should shake hands with the respondents and thank them for their 
time and information.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Ms. De La Garza, I know you have given your time and effort to help me. I appreciate it. 
Good-bye.”  
 
 
Assessment Questions 
The closer you get to the admission-seeking interview, the greater chance of facing 
deception. Witnesses might try to cover up what they know, and the target may lie to try to 
convince you that they are not guilty. When you believe the respondent’s answers may be 
deceptive, you should begin asking assessment questions. 
 
Assessment  questions  seek to establish the credibility of the respondent. They are used only 
when the interviewer considers previous statements by the respondent to be inconsistent 
because of possible deception.  
 
Once the respondent has answered all questions  about the event, and the interviewer has 
reason to believe the respondent is being deceptive, a theme must be established to justify 
additional questions. This theme can ordinarily be put forth by saying, “I have a few additional 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.238   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
questions.” Do not indicate in any way that these questions are for a different purpose than 
seeking information.  
 
Norming or Calibrating 
Norming  or calibrating  is the process of observing behavior before critical questions are asked, 
as opposed to doing so during questioning. Norming should be a routine part of all 
interviews. People with truthful attitudes will answer questions one way; those with 
untruthful attitudes will generally answer them differently. Assessment questions ask the 
subject to agree with matters that go against the principles of most honest people. In other 
words, dishonest people are likely to agree with many of the statements, while honest people 
won’t. Assessment questions are designed primarily to get a verbal or nonverbal reaction 
from the respondent. The interviewer will then carefully assess that reaction.  
 
Suggestions for observing the verbal and physical behavior of the respondent include: 
• Use your senses of touch, sight, and hearing to establish a norm. 
• Do not stare or call attention to the person’s behavior symptoms. 
• Be aware of the respondent’s entire body. 
• Observe the timing and consistency of behavior. 
• Note clusters of behaviors. 
 
The best way to calibrate a witness is through the use of noncritical questions on 
background information, place of employment, and the like. If the witness displays general 
nervousness or other verbal and non-verbal clues during this phase of questioning, 
subsequent indicators may not be reliable. The key is to observe changes in behavior when 
pertinent questions are asked.  
 
Based on the respondent’s reaction to the assessment questions, the interviewer then 
considers all the verbal and nonverbal responses together (not in isolation) to decide 
whether to proceed to the admission-seeking phase of the interview. No one behavior 
should be isolated or a conclusion drawn from it. They should be considered together. 
 
Physiology of Deception 
It is said that everyone lies and does so for one of two reasons: to receive rewards or to 
avoid punishment. In most people, lying produces stress. The human body will attempt to 
relieve this stress (even in practiced liars) through verbal and nonverbal clues. 
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.239 
Conclusions concerning behavior must be tempered by a number of factors. The physical 
environment in which the interview is conducted can affect behavior. If the respondent is 
comfortable, fewer behavior quirks might be exhibited. The more intelligent the respondent, 
the more reliable verbal and nonverbal clues will be. If the respondent is biased toward the 
interviewer, or vice versa, this will affect behavior. 
 
People who are mentally unstable, or are under the influence of drugs, will be unsuitable to 
interview. Behavior symptoms of juveniles are generally unreliable. Racial, ethnic, and 
economic factors should be carefully noted. Some cultures, for example, discourage looking 
directly at someone. Other cultures use certain body language that might be misinterpreted. 
Because professional pathological liars often are familiar with interview techniques, they are 
less likely to furnish observable behavioral clues.  
 
Verbal Clues 
Verbal clues are those relating to wordings, expressions, and responses to specific questions. 
Verbal responses include spoken words and gestures that serve as word substitutes, 
including nodding or shaking the head to indicate “yes” and “no.” The following are some 
examples of verbal clues. 
 
CHANGES IN SPEECH PATTERNS 
Deceptive people often speed up or slow down their speech, or speak louder. There might 
be a change in the voice pitch; as a person becomes tense, the vocal chords constrict. 
Deceptive people also have a tendency to cough or clear their throats during times of 
deception. 
 
REPETITION OF THE QUESTION 
Repeating the question is a means for a deceptive respondent to gain more time to think of 
what to say. The respondent may repeat the question verbatim, or he may frame the answer 
with a request to repeat the question (e.g., “What was that again?”  or similar language). 
Conversely, a truthful subject usually does not have to contemplate his answer.  
 
COMMENTS REGARDING INTERVIEW 
Deceptive people will often complain about the physical environment of the interview room, 
such as, “It’s cold in here.” They will also sometimes ask how much longer the interview  
will take. 
 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.240   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
SELECTIVE MEMORY 
In some cases, the deceptive person will have a fine memory for insignificant events, but 
when it comes to the important facts, “just can’t seem to remember.” 
 
MAKING EXCUSES 
Dishonest people will frequently make excuses about things that look bad for them, such as, 
“ I’m always nervous; don’t pay any attention to that.” 
 
EMPHASIS ON CERTAIN WORDS 
On frequent occasions, dishonest people will a dd what they believe to be credibility to their 
lies by use of emphasis.  
 
OATHS 
Dishonest persons frequently use expressions such as “I swear to God,” “Honestly,” “Frankly,” 
or “To tell the truth” to add credibility to their lies. 
 
CHARACTER TESTIMONY 
A liar will often request that the interviewer, “Check with my wife,” or “Talk to my minister.” 
This is frequently done to add credibility to a false statement. 
 
ANSWERING WITH A QUESTION 
Rather than deny the allegations outright, the liar might frequently answer with a question, 
such as, “Why would I do something like that?” As a variation, the deceptive person will 
sometimes question the interview procedure by asking, “Why are you picking on me?” 
 
OVERUSE OF RESPECT 
Some deceptive people will go out of their way to be respectful and friendly. When accused 
of wrongdoing, it is unnatural for a person to react in a friendly and respectful manner.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Respondent : 
“I’m sorry, sir, I know you’re just doing your job. But I didn’t do it.” 
 
INCREASINGLY WEAKER DENIALS 
When an honest person is accused of something he did not do, that person is likely to 
become angry or forceful in making denials. The more the innocent person is accused, the 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.241 
more forceful the denial becomes. The dishonest person, on the other hand, is likely to make 
a weak denial. Upon repeated accusations, the dishonest person’s denials become weaker, to 
the point that the person becomes silent. 
 
FAILURE TO DENY 
Dishonest people are more likely than honest people to deny an event specifically. An 
honest person might offer a simple and clear “no” while the dishonest person will qualify the 
denial: “No, I did not steal $43,500 fr om the company on June 27.” Other qualified denial phrases 
include, “To the best of my memory,” and “As far as I recall,” or similar language. 
 
AVOIDANCE OF EMOTIVE WORDS 
A liar will often avoid emotionally provocative terms such as steal, lie, and crime. Instead, the 
dishonest person frequently prefers “soft” words such as borrow, and it (referring to the deed 
in question). 
 
REFUSAL TO IMPLICATE OTHER SUSPECTS 
Both the honest respondent and the liar will have a natural reluctance to name others 
involved in misdeeds. However, the liar will frequently refuse to implicate possible suspects, 
no matter how much pressure is applied by the interviewer. This is because the culpable 
person does not want the circle of suspicion to be narrowed. 
 
TOLERANT ATTITUDES 
Dishonest people typically have tolerant attitudes toward miscreant conduct. The interviewer 
in an internal theft case might ask, “What should happen to this person when he is caught?” The 
honest person will usually say, “They should be fired/prosecuted.” The dishonest individual is 
much more likely to reply, “How should I know?” or, “Maybe he is a good employee who got into 
problems. Perhaps he should be given a second chance.” 
 
RELUCTANCE TO TERMINATE INTERVIEW 
Dishonest people will generally be more reluctant than honest ones to terminate the 
interview. The dishonest individual wants to convince the interviewer that he is not 
responsible, so that the investigation will not continue. The honest person, on the other 
hand, generally has no such reluctance. 
 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.242   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
FEIGNED UNCONCERN 
The dishonest person will often try to appear casual and unconcerned, will frequently adopt 
an unnatural slouching posture, and might react to questions with nervous or false laughter 
or feeble attempts at humor. The honest person, conversely, will typically be very concerned 
about being suspected of wrongdoing, and will treat the interviewer’s questions seriously. 
 
Nonverbal Clues 
Nonverbal clues to deception include various body movements and postures accompanying 
the verbal reply. Some of these are discussed below. 
 
FULL-BODY MOTIONS 
When asked sensitive or emotive questions, the dishonest person will typically change his 
posture completely, as if moving away from the interviewer. The honest person will 
frequently lean forward toward the interviewer when questions are serious. 
 
ANATOMICAL PHYSICAL RESPONSES 
Anatomical physical responses are those involuntary reactions by the body to fright such as 
increased heart rate, shallow or labored breathing, or excessive perspiration. These reactions 
are typical of dishonest people accused of wrongdoing. 
 
ILLUSTRATORS 
Illustrators are the motions made primarily with the hands to demonstrate points when 
talking. During nonthreatening questions, the illustrators might be done at one rate. During 
threatening questions, the use of illustrators might increase or decrease. 
 
HANDS OVER THE MOUTH 
Frequently, dishonest people will cover the mouth with the hand or fingers during 
deception. This reaction goes back to childhood, when many children cover their mouths 
when telling a lie. It is done subconsciously to conceal the statement. 
 
MANIPULATORS 
Manipulators are motions like picking lint from clothing, playing with objects such as 
pencils, or holding one’s hands while talking. Manipulators are displacement activities that 
reduce nervousness. 
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.243 
FLEEING POSITIONS 
During the interview, dishonest people will often posture themselves in a “fleeing position.” 
While the head and trunk might be facing the interviewer, the feet and lower portion of the 
body might be pointing toward the door in an unconscious effort to flee from the 
interviewer. 
 
CROSSING THE ARMS 
Crossing one’s arms over the middle zones of the body is a classic defensive reaction to 
difficult or uncomfortable questions. A variation is crossing the feet under the chair and 
locking them. These crossing motions occur mostly when being deceptive. 
 
REACTION TO EVIDENCE 
While trying to be outwardly concerned, the guilty person will have a keen interest in 
implicating evidence. The dishonest person will often look at documents presented by the 
interviewer, attempt to be casual about observing them, and then shove them away, as if 
wanting nothing to do with the evidence. 
 
Most actions that are designed to interrupt the flow of speech are stress related. Examples 
include:  
• Closing the mouth tightly 
• Pursing the lips 
• Covering the mouth with the hand 
• Lip and tongue biting 
• Licking the lips 
• Chewing on objects 
 
Genuine smiles usually involve the whole mouth; false ones are confined to the upper half. 
People involved in deception tend to smirk rather than to smile. 
 
CROSSING 
The body or legs might be crossed to reduce stress. When the hands are crossing the body, it 
is a defensive gesture, to protect the “soft underbelly.” 
 
Methodology of Assessment Questions 
Assessment questions should proceed logically from the least to the most sensitive. The 
following questions illustrate the pattern that an interviewer might take in questioning a 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.244   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
witness when he has some reason to believe the respondent, a company employee, has 
knowledge of a suspected fraud. In most examples, the question’s basis is explained before 
the question is asked. The initial questions seek agreement. 
 
The following questions assume the examiner has some reason to believe the respondent, a 
company employee, has knowledge of a suspected fraud. 
 
EXAMPLE  
Interviewer: 
“The company is particularly concerned about fraud and abuse. There are some new laws in 
effect that will cost the company millions if abus es go on and we don’t try to find them. Do you 
know which law I am talking about?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
Most individuals will not know about the laws concerning corporate sentencing 
guidelines, and will, therefore, answer “no.” The purpose of this question is to get the 
respondent to understand the serious nature of fraud and abuse. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Congress recently passed a law last year that can levy fines of more than $200 million against 
companies that don’t try to clean their own houses.  $200 million is a lot of money, so you can 
understand why the company’s concerned, can’t you?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
The majority of people will say “yes” to this question. In the event of a “no” answer, the 
interviewer should explain the issue fully and, thereafter, attempt to get the respondent’s 
agreement. If that agreement is not forthcoming, the interviewer should assess why not. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Of course, they are not talking about a loyal employee who gets in a bind. They’re talking 
more about senior management. Have you ever read in the newspapers  about what kind of 
people engage in company misdeeds?” 
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.245 
EXPLANATION 
Most people read the newspapers and are at least generally familiar with the problem of 
fraud and abuse. Agreement by the respondent is expected to this question. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Most of them aren’t criminals at all. A lot of times, they’re just trying to save their jobs or just 
trying to get by because the company is so cheap that it won’t pay people what they are worth. 
Do you know what I mean?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
Although the honest person and the dishonest person will both probably answer “yes” 
to this question, the honest individual is less likely to accept the premise that these 
people are not wrongdoers. Many honest people might reply, “Yes, I understand, but that 
doesn’t justify stealing.” 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Why do you think someone around here might be justified in taking  company property?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
Because fraud perpetrators frequently justify their acts, the dishonest individual is more 
likely than the honest person to attempt a justification, such as, “Everyone does it,”  or “The 
company should treat people better if they don’t want them to steal.”  The honest person, on the 
other hand, is much more likely to say, “There is no justification for stealing from the company. It 
is dishonest.”  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“How do you think we should deal with someone who got in a bind and did something wrong in 
the eyes of the company?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
Similar to other questions in this series, the ho nest person wants to “throw the book” at the 
miscreant, while the culpable individual typically will say, “How should I know? It’s not up to 
me,” or, “If they were a good employee, maybe we should give them another chance.”  
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.246   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Do you think someone in your department might have taken something from the company 
because they thought they were justified?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
Most people — honest or dishonest — will answer “no” to this question. The culpable 
person, however, will more likely say “yes” wi thout elaborating. The honest person, if 
answering “yes,” will most likely provide details. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Have you ever felt yourself—even though you di dn’t go through with it—justified in taking 
advantage of your position?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
Again, most people, both honest and dishonest, will answer this question “no.” The 
dishonest person, however, is more likely to acknowledge having at least “thought” of 
doing it. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Who in your department do you feel would think they were justified in doing something against 
the company?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
The dishonest person will not likely furnish an answer to this question, saying instead 
that, “I guess anyone could have a justification if they wanted to.” The honest individual, on the 
other hand, is more likely to name names—albeit reluctantly. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Do you believe that most people will tell their manager if they believed a colleague was doing 
something wrong, like committin g fraud against the company?” 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.247 
EXPLANATION 
The honest person has more of a sense of integrity, and is much more likely to report a 
misdeed. The dishonest person is more likely to say “no.” When pressed for an 
explanation, this person will typically say, “No, nothing would be done about it, and they 
wouldn’t believe me anyhow.”  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Is there any reason why someone who works with  you would say they thought you might feel 
justified in doing something wrong?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
This is a hypothetical question designed to place the thought in the mind of a wrongdoer 
that someone has named him as a suspect. The honest person will typically say “no.” 
The dishonest person is more likely to try to explain by saying something like, “I know 
there are people around here who don’t like me.”  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“What would concern you most if you did something wrong and it was found out?” 
 
EXPLANATION 
The dishonest person is likely to say something like, “I wouldn’t want to go to jail.” The 
honest person, however, might reject the notion by saying, “I’m not concerned at all, because 
I haven’t done anything.” If the honest person does explain, it will usually be along the lines 
of disappointing friends or family; the di shonest person is more likely to mention 
punitive measures.

Admission-Seeking Questions 
The choice of when to conduct an admission-seeking interview of a suspect is critical. 
Normally, the interviewer should ask accusatory or admission-seeking questions when there 
is a reasonable probability that the respondent has committed the act in question, all other 
reasonable investigative steps have been completed and as much information as possible has 
been developed from other sources, and the interviewer can reasonably control the place, 
time, and subject matter of the interview. An assessment of culpability might be based on 
verbal and nonverbal responses to interview questions, as well as documents, physical 
evidence, and other interviews.  
 
A transitional theme is necessary when proceeding from assessment-seeking questions to 
admission-seeking questions. Part of the purpose of this theme is to create in the mind of 
the miscreant that he has been caught. Under the ideal circumstance, the interviewer will 
leave the room for just a few minutes, saying this is to “check on something.” If the 
interviewer has incriminating documents, copies can be placed inside a file folder and 
brought back to the interview. If no documents exist, it might be appropriate to fill a file 
folder with blank paper. 
  
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.249 
EXAMPLE 
 
When the interviewer returns to  the room, the file folder is placed on the desk, and the 
interviewer asks, “Is there something that  you would like to tell me about_________ _ ?” 
OR 
“Is there any reason why some one would say that you _________?” 
 
Hand the documents to the respondent and ask for “comments.” Do not introduce the 
evidence or explain it. In about 20 percent of the cases, the miscreant will admit to 
incriminating conduct. If not, proceed. Once the interviewer is reasonably convinced of 
guilt, it might be appropriate to confront the respondent.  
 
Purpose of Questions 
Admission-seeking questions have at least three purposes. The first purpose is to distinguish 
innocent people from guilty. A culpable individual will frequently confess during the 
admission-seeking phase of an interview, while an innocent person will not do so unless 
threats or coercion are used. In some instances, the only way to differentiate the culpable 
from the innocent is to seek an admission of guilt.  
 
The second purpose is to obtain a valid confession. Confessions, under the law, must be 
voluntarily obtained. The importance of a valid and binding confession to wrongdoing 
cannot be overstated. The third purpose of admission-seeking questions is to convince the 
confessor to sign a written statement acknowledging the facts. Although oral confessions are 
legally as binding as written ones, the written statement has greater credibility. It also 
discourages miscreants from later attempting to recant.  
 
Preparation 
The interview should be scheduled when the interviewer can control the situation. It 
normally should not be conducted on the accused’s turf and is best conducted by surprise. 
 
Interview Room 
When preparing a room for an admission-seeking interview, it is important that the 
interviewer consider the privacy afforded by the room. The location should establish a sense 
of privacy. The door should be closed but not locked, there should be no physical barriers 
preventing the target from leaving, and the suspect should be made aware that he is free to 
leave. This is to avoid allegations of “custodial interrogation.” 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.250   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Distractions should be kept to a minimum. Ideally, there should be no photographs, 
windows, or other objects in the room. Chairs should be placed about four to six feet apart, 
and the accused should not be permitted to sit behind any physical barriers, such as chairs, 
tables, or desks. This is to prohibit a psychological barrier for the accused to “hide behind.”  
 
Note-Taking 
When conducting an admission-seeking interview, note taking should be kept to a minimum. 
In some cases, taking notes should be altogether avoided. Since the ultimate goal of the 
admission-seeking interview is to obtain a signed statement in which the suspect admits guilt, 
it is not necessary to take extensive notes, which can be distracting to the suspect and can 
reveal what points the examiner believes to be important. Notes, if taken during the 
interview, should be done in a way that does not reveal their significance. 
 
Presence of Outsiders 
It is usually not necessary to inform the subject that he may have counsel present. Of course, 
this right cannot be denied if the subject wishes to have an attorney present. If counsel is 
present, you should have an understanding that he will be an observer only; attorneys should 
not ask questions or object. Other than the subject and two examiners, no other observers 
should be permitted in the admission-seeking interview. If the accused is in a union, a union 
representative (or a union attorney) might have the right to attend. However, this might 
present legal problems in “broadcasting” the allegation to a third party. It is very difficult to 
obtain a confession with witnesses present. The examiner should therefore consider whether 
the case can be proven without the admission-seeking interview. (Please refer to the Law 
section of the Fraud Examiners  Manual  for more information.) 
 
Miranda Warnings  
As a general rule, private employees conducting an internal investigation are not required to 
give Miranda  warnings; however, there are exceptions to the rule. (See the chapter on 
“Individual Rights” in the Law section of the Fraud Examiners Manual  for more information.) 
 
Theme Development 
People rarely confess voluntarily. People will confess to matters when they perceive that the 
benefits of confession outweigh the penalties. A good interviewer, through the application of 
sophisticated techniques, will be able to convince the respondent that the confession is in his 
best interest.  
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.251 
People generally will not confess if they believe that there is doubt in the mind of the accuser 
regarding their guilt. The interviewer must convey absolute confidence in the admission-seeking — 
even if not fully convinced. The inter viewer must make the accusation in the form 
of a statement of fact. Accusatory questions do not ask “Did you do it?” They ask, “Why did 
you do it?” 
 
An innocent person generally will not accept the question’s premise.  People confessing need 
adequate time to come to terms with their guilt; obtaining admissions and confessions takes 
patience. Therefore, admission-seeking interviews should be done only when there is 
sufficient privacy and time is not a factor. The interviewer must not express disgust, outrage, 
or moral condemnation about the confessor’s actions. To do so goes against the basic logic 
of obtaining confessions, which can be summed up as maximize sympathy and minimize the 
perception of moral wrongdoing.   
 
The interviewer must offer a morally acceptable reason for the confessor’s behavior. The 
interviewer cannot convey to the accused that he is a “bad person.” Guilty people will 
almost never confess under such conditions. To obtain a confession, the interviewer must be 
firm but must project compassion, understanding, and sympathy. The interviewer must 
attempt to keep the confessor from voicing a denial. Once the accused denies the act, 
overcoming that position will be very difficult. 
 
The threat of a lawsuit is always present when allegations of wrongdoing are made against 
certain employees. It is therefore important that examiners understand exactly what actions 
are permitted so that they can avoid potential liability. It is generally legal to accuse innocent 
people of misdeeds they did not commit as long as: 
• The accuser has reasonable suspicion or predication to believe the accused has 
committed an offense. 
• The accusation is made under conditions of privacy. 
• The accuser does not take any action likely to make an innocent person confess. 
• The accusation is conducted under reasonable conditions. 
 
Steps in the Admission-Seeking Interview 
Direct Accusation  
The accusation should not be made in the form of a question, but as a statement. Emotive 
words such as steal, fraud, and crime  should be avoided during the accusatory process. The 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.252   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
accusation should be phrased as though the accused’s guilt has already been established so 
that the accused is psychologically trapped with no way out.  
 
EXAMPLE 
WRONG: 
“We have reason to believe that you ...” 
OR 
“We think (suspect) you might have ...” 
 
RIGHT: 
“Our investigation has clearly established that you: 
? made a false entry (avoid fraud) 
? took company assets without permission (avoid using theft, embezzlement, or stealing) 
? accepted money from a vendor (avoid bribe or kickback) 
? have not told the complete truth (avoid lie or fraud )” 
OR 
“ We have been conducting an  investigation into ________ _ _, and you are the only person we 
have not been able to eliminate as being responsible.” 
 
Observe Reaction 
When accused of wrongdoing, the typical guilty person will react with silence. If the accused 
does deny culpability, those denials will usually be weak. In some cases, the accused will 
almost mumble the denial. It is common for the culpable individual to avoid outright denials. 
Rather, that person will give reasons why he could not have committed the act in question. 
The innocent person will sometimes react with genuine shock at being accused. It is not at 
all unusual for an innocent person, wrongfully accused, to react with anger. As opposed to 
the guilty person, the innocent person will strongly deny carrying out the act or acts  
in question.  
 
Repeat Accusation 
If the accused does not strenuously object after the accusation is made, the interviewer 
should repeat the accusation with the same degree of conviction and strength.  
  
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.253 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“As I said, Linda, our examination has concluded that you are the responsible person. It is not 
so much a question of what you did, but why you did it.” 
 
Interrupt Denials 
Both the truthful and untruthful person will normally object to and deny the accusations. 
But when compared to an innocent person, a culpable person is more likely to stop short of 
an outright denial ( “I didn’t do it. ”) and is more apt to furnish the interviewer with 
explanations as to why he is not the responsible party. An innocent person is unlikely to 
allow the interviewer to prevail in stopping the denial.  
 
 EXAMPLE 
Respondent : 
“I wasn’t even there the day  that entry was made.” 
OR 
“It could have been anybody.” 
OR 
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” 
 
Both the innocent and the guilty person will make an outright denial if forced to do so. 
Accordingly, the interviewer should not solicit a denial at this stage of the admission-seeking 
interview. 
 
EXAMPLE 
WRONG 
Interviewer:  
“Did you do this?” 
OR 
“Are you the responsible person?” 
RIGHT 
Interviewer:  
“Why did you do this?” 
 
Additionally, the interviewer must prevent the subject from making an outright denial 
because it becomes extremely difficult to change a denial once it is uttered. If the person 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.254   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
denies the accusation and later admits it, he is admitting to lying, and this type of admission 
is hard to make. Therefore, the interviewer’s job is to prevent the subject from making an 
outright denial, thereby making it easier for the subject to confess to the act.  
 
Examiners can use several techniques to stop or interrupt denials.  
 
DELAYS 
One of the most effective techniques to stop or interrupt the denial is through a delaying 
tactic. The interviewer should not argue with the accused, but rather attempt to delay the 
outright denial. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I hear what you are saying, but let me finish first. Then you can talk.” 
 
The innocent person usually will not “hold on” or let the interviewer continue to develop 
the theme. 
 
REPEAT INTERRUPTIONS 
Occasionally, it might be necessary to interrupt  the accused’s attempted denial repeatedly. 
Because this stage is crucial, the interviewer should be prepared to increase the tone of the 
interruptions to the point when he is prepared to say: “Linda, if you keep interrupting, I am going 
to have to terminate this conversation.” The guilty individual will find this threatening, because she 
wants to know the extent of incriminating evidence in the interviewer’s possession.  
 
REASONING 
If the above techniques are unsuccessful, the interviewer might attempt to reason with the 
accused, and employ some of the tactics normally used for diffusing alibis (see below). 
Under these tactics, the accused is presented with evidence implicating him. The interviewer, 
however, normally should not disclose all the facts of the case, but rather small portions here 
and there. 
 
  
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.255 
 EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“I know what you say, Linda, but that doesn’t square with these invoices here in front of me. 
Look at the invoice in the amount of $102,1 36. The facts clearly show you are responsible.” 
(Do not ask the accused to explain the evidence at this point.)  
OR 
“Linda, I have talked to many pe ople before I sat down here with  you. I am not asking you if 
you’re responsible; I know you are. This is your opportunity to tell your side to someone who can 
understand.” (Do not disclose the identity or number of the witnesses who have 
been interviewed.) 
 
Establish Rationalization 
Once the accusation has been made, repeated, and denials are stopped, it is time for the 
interviewer to establish a morally acceptable rationalization that will allow the accused to 
square the misdeed with his conscience. It is not necessary that this theme be related to the 
underlying causes of the misconduct. It is common and acceptable for the accused to explain 
away the moral consequences of the action by seizing onto any plausible explanation other 
than being a “bad person.” 
 
If the accused does not seem to relate to one theme, the interviewer should go on to another 
until one seems to fit. Thereafter, that theme should be developed fully. Note that the theme 
development explains away the moral?but not the legal—consequences of the misdeed. 
The interviewer is cautioned not to make any statements that would lead the accused to 
believe he will be excused from legal liability by cooperating.  
 
The questions posed in the examples, rather than being confrontational, constantly seek 
agreement from the accused. The interviewer must strike a balance between being in control 
of the interview and still appearing compassionate and understanding. Again, no matter what 
conduct the accused has supposedly committed, the interviewer should not express shock, 
outrage, or condemnation. 
 
UNFAIR TREATMENT 
Probably the most common explanation for criminal activity in general, and internal fraud in 
particular, is unfair treatment and the accused’s attempt to achieve equity. Studies have 
shown that counter-productive employee behavior—including stealing—is motivated 
primarily by job dissatisfaction. Employees and others feel that “strik ing back” is important 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.256   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
to their self-esteem. The sensitive interviewer can capitalize on these feelings by suggesting 
to the accused that he is a victim. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I feel like I know what makes you tick. And I know it isn’t like you to do something 
like this without a reason. You have worked hard here to get a good reputation. I don’t think 
the company has paid you what you’re really worth. And that’s the way you feel too, isn’t it?” 
OR 
“Linda, I’ve seen situations like this before. And I think the company brought this on 
themselves. If you had been fairly treated, this wouldn’t have happened, don’t you agree?” 
 
INADEQUATE RECOGNITION 
Some employees might feel that their efforts have gone completely without notice by the 
company. As with similar themes, the interviewer should be empathetic. 
 
 EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I have found out a few things about you. It looks to me that you have given a lot more 
to this company than they have re cognized. Isn’t that right, Linda?” 
 
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS 
Internal criminals, especially executives and upper management, frequently engage in fraud 
to conceal their true financial condition — either  personal or business. Here are examples of 
how to develop a theme involving financial problems as a motive. In the following example, 
E. J. is an executive of a company and is suspected of fraud.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“ E. J., I was astonished to find out some of your investments have taken such a beating. I don’t 
know how you managed to keep everything afloat as  well as you did. You just did this to stay 
alive financially, didn’t you, E. J.?” 
OR 
“ E. J., I have found out what you’ve been paid around here and, frankly, I was surprised. I 
thought it might be a lot more. No wonder you had to get involved in this. You pretty much 
needed to do this to survive, didn’t you?” 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.257 
ABERRATION OF CONDUCT 
Many miscreants believe their conduct constitutes  an aberration in their lives and that it is 
not representative of their true character. The interviewer might establish this theme by 
applying the following examples. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I know this is totally out of character for you. I know that this would never have 
happened if something wasn’t going on in your life. Isn’t that right, Linda?” 
OR 
“ E. J., you’ve worked hard all your life to get a good reputation. I feel you wouldn’t normally 
have done something like this; it  just doesn’t fit unless you felt like you were forced into it. You 
felt forced to do this, didn’t you, E. J.?” 
 
FAMILY PROBLEMS 
Some people commit fraud because of family problems — financial woes caused by divorce, 
an unfaithful spouse, or demanding children. Men especially — who have been socially 
conditioned to tie their masculinity to earning power — might hold the notion that wealth 
connotes family respect. For their part, women have been found to commit white-collar 
crime in the name of their responsibility to the needs of their husbands and children. The 
skillful interviewer can convert this motive to his advantage by applying one of the following 
approaches. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I know you have had some family problems. I know your recent divorce has been 
difficult for you. And I know how it is when these problems occur. You never would have done 
this if it hadn’t been for family problems; isn’t that right, Linda?” 
OR 
“E. J., someone in your position and with your ethics just doesn’t do things like this without a 
reason. And I think that reason has to do with trying to make the best possible life for your 
family. I know it would be difficult for me to admit to my family that we’re not as well off as we 
were last year. And that’s why you did this, isn’t it, E. J.?” 
    
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.258   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
ACCUSER’S ACTIONS 
Don’t disclose the accuser’s identity if it is not already known. But in cases where the 
accuser’s identity is known to the accused, it can be helpful to blame the accuser for the 
problem. The accuser can be a colleague, manager, auditor, fraud examiner, or any similar 
person. Alternatively, the problem can be blamed on the company. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, you know what these auditors are like. They are hired to turn over every stone. I 
wonder how they would look if we put them under  a microscope. Compared to other things that 
are going on, what you’ve done isn’t that bad. Right, Linda?” 
OR 
“ E. J., I really blame a large part of this on the company. If some of the things that went on 
around this company were known, it would make what you’ve done seem pretty small in 
comparison, wouldn’t it, E. J.?” 
 
STRESS, DRUGS, AND ALCOHOL 
Employees will sometimes turn to drugs or alcohol to reduce stress. In some instances, the 
stress itself will lead to aberrant behavior in a few individuals. A rationalization established 
by the interviewer could be similar to the following. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I know what you’ve done isn’t really you. Inside, you have been in a lot of turmoil. A 
lot of people drink too much when they have problems. I have been through periods like that 
myself. And when things build up inside, it sometimes makes all of us do something we 
shouldn’t. That’s what happened here, isn’t it, Linda?” 
OR 
“E. J., you’re one of the most respected men in this company. I know you have been under 
tremendous pressure to succeed. Too much pressure, really. There is only so much any of us can 
take. That’s behind what has happened here, isn’t it, E. J.?” 
 
REVENGE 
Similar to other themes, revenge can be effectively developed as a motive. In this technique, 
the interviewer attempts to blame the offense on the accused’s feeling that he must “get 
back” at someone or something. 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.259 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, what has happened is out of character for you. I think you were trying to get back at 
your supervisor for the time he passed you over for a raise. I would probably feel the same. 
That’s what happened, isn’t it, Linda?” 
OR 
“E. J., everyone around here knows that the board has not supported you in your efforts to turn 
this company around. I would understand if you said to yourself, ‘I’ll show them.’ Is that what 
happened, E. J.?” 
 
DEPERSONALIZING THE VICTIM 
In cases involving employee theft, an effective technique is to depersonalize the victim. The 
accused is better able to cope with the moral dilemma of his actions if the victim is a faceless 
corporation or agency. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, it isn’t like you took something from a friend or neighbor. I can see how you could say, 
‘Well, this would be okay to do as long as it  was against the company,  and not my coworkers.’ 
Is that right, Linda?” 
OR 
“E. J., it’s not like what you’ve done has really  hurt one person. Maybe you thought of it this 
way: ‘At most, I’ve cost each shareholder a few cents.’ Is that the way it was, E. J.?” 
 
MINOR MORAL INFRACTION 
The interviewer in many cases can reduce the accused’s perception of the moral seriousness 
of the matter. This is not to be confused with the legal seriousness. Fraud examiners and 
interviewers should be careful to avoid making statements that could be construed as 
relieving legal responsibility. For example, the examiner should not state: “It is not a big deal, 
legally. It’s just a technical violation.” Instead, the interviewer should play down the moral side. 
One effective way is through comparisons, such as those illustrated below. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, this problem we have doesn’t mean you’re Jack the Ripper. When you compare what 
you’ve done to things other people do, this situation seems pretty insignificant, doesn’t it?” 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.260   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
OR 
“E. J., everything is relative. What you’ve done doesn’t even come close to some of the other 
things that have happened. You’re not Bernie Madoff, right E. J.?” 
OR 
“I could see myself in your place. I probably wo uld have done the same thing, wouldn’t I?” 
 
ALTRUISM 
In many cases, the moral seriousness of the matter can be reduced by claiming the action 
was for the benefit of others. This is especially true if the accused views himself as a  
caring person. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I know you didn’t do this for yourself. I have looked into this matter carefully, and I 
think you did this to help your husband, didn’t you?” 
OR 
“E. J., you have a big responsibili ty in this company. A lot of people depend on you for their 
jobs. I just know you did this because you thought you were doing the right thing for the 
company, didn’t you?” 
 
GENUINE NEED 
In a very small number of cases, fraud is predicated by genuine need. For example, the 
accused might be paying for the medical care of sick parents or a child. Or some other 
financial disaster might have befallen the miscreant. In those cases, the following techniques 
might be effective. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I don’t know many people who have had so many bad things happen all at once. I can 
see where you thought this was pretty much a matter of life or death, right, Linda?” 
OR 
“E. J., you’re like everyone else: you have to put food on the table. But in your position, it is 
very difficult to ask for help. You genuinely needed  to do this to survive, didn’t you, E. J.?” 
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.261 
Diffuse Alibis 
Even if the accused is presented with an appropriate rationalization, it is likely that he will 
continue to want to deny culpability. When the interviewer is successful in stopping denials, 
the accused normally will then turn to various reasons why he could not have committed the 
act in question. The purpose of this stage is to convince the accused of the weight of the 
evidence against him. Miscreants usually have a keen interest in material that tends to 
implicate them. Alibis generally can be diffused using one of the methods listed below. 
 
DISPLAY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE 
It is common for most guilty people to overestimate the amount of physical evidence. The 
interviewer wants to try and reinforce this notion in the way the evidence is laid out to the 
accused. The physical evidence — usually documents in fraud matters — generally should be 
displayed one piece at a time, in reverse order of importance. In this way, the full extent of 
the evidence is not immediately known by the accused. When the accused no longer denies 
culpability, the interviewer should stop displaying evidence.  
 
Each time a document or piece of evidence is laid out to the accused, its significance should 
be noted by the interviewer. During this phase, the accused is still trying to come to grips 
with being caught. The interviewer should, therefore, expect that the accused will attempt to 
lie his way out of the situation. Like denials, the interviewer should stop the alibis and other 
falsehoods before they are fully articulated.  
 
Once the alibis are diffused, the interviewer should return to the theme being developed. 
The following is an example of this technique used on Linda Reed Collins, who set up a 
fictitious company and embezzled money by approving payments from her employer to a 
shell corporation. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Respondent : 
“I couldn’t have done this. I am not responsible for paying invoices.” 
 
Interviewer:  
“Here is one of the invoices in question [display document]. We never received the merchandise.” 
(Don’t mention whether you have talked to the accounts payable department or 
whether you have subjected the invoice to any document analysis.)  
 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.262   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
“Look, Linda, it is useless for you to try to deny the truth. We have lots of evidence. Let’s just 
try to work this out, but you’ve got to help me, okay?” (Don’t accuse the person of 
lying — this just prolongs the process.) 
 
DISCUSS WITNESSES 
Another technique for diffusing alibis is to discuss the testimony of witnesses. The objective 
is to give enough information about what other people would say without providing too 
much. Ideally, the interviewer’s statement will create the impression in the mind of the 
accused that many people are in a position to contradict his story. 
 
The interviewer is again cautioned about furnishing enough information to the accused so 
that he can identify the witnesses. This might place the witness in a difficult position, and the 
accused could contact the witness in an effort to influence testimony. The accused could 
take reprisals against potential witnesses, though this is rare.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Respondent : 
“I couldn’t possibly have done this. It would require the approval of a supervisor.” 
 
Interviewer: 
“In normal situations it would. The problem is that your statement doesn’t hold up. There are 
several people who will tell a completely different story. I can understand how you would want 
me to believe that. But you’re only worsening the situation by making these statements. If you 
will help me on this, you’ll also be helping yourself. Understand?” 
 
DISCUSS DECEPTIONS 
The final technique is to discuss the accused’s de ceptions. The purpose is to appeal to the 
accused’s logic, not to scold or degrade. This technique is sometimes the only one available 
if physical evidence is lacking. As with other interview situations, the word lying  should  
be avoided.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Respondent : 
“There is no way I could have done this. I didn’t have the opportunity.” 
  
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.263 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, here is the situation: you know what you’ ve done, and so do I. I can understand it is 
difficult for you to admit. But if all the facts have  to be presented, everyone will reach the same 
inescapable conclusion: you are responsible. If you continue to deny  what you’ve done, you’ll just 
make the situation worse. You understand that, don’t you?” 
 
Present an Alternative Question  
After the accused’s alibis have been diffused, he normally will become quiet and withdrawn. 
Some people in this situation might cry. If so, be comforting. Do not discourage the accused 
from showing emotion. In this stage, the accused is deciding whether to confess. The 
interviewer at this point should present an alternative question to the accused. The 
alternative question forces the accused to make one of two choices. One alternative allows 
the accused a morally acceptable reason for the misdeed; the other paints the accused in a 
negative light. Regardless of which answer the accused chooses, he is acknowledging guilt.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, did you plan this deliberately, or did it just happen?” 
OR 
“Linda, did you just want extra money, or did you do this because you had financial 
problems?” 
OR 
“Linda, did you just get greedy, or did you do this because of the way the company has treated 
you?” 
 
Obtain a Benchmark Admission 
Either way the accused answers the alternative question — either yes or no — he has made a 
culpable statement, or a benchmark  admission. Once the benchmark admission is made, the 
miscreant has made a subconscious decision to confess.  
 
The questions for the benchmark admission should be constructed as leading questions so 
they can be answered “yes” or “no;” they should not be constructed so that the answer 
requires some type of explanation. That will come later. The accused might also answer in 
the negative.  
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.264   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
EXAMPLE 
Respondent : 
“I didn’t do it deliberately.” 
OR 
“I didn’t do it just beca use I wanted extra money.” 
OR 
“No, I’m not just greedy.” 
 
In the cases where the accused answers the alternative question in the negative, the 
interviewer should press further for a positive admission. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Then it just happened on the spur of the moment?” 
OR 
“Then you did it to take care of your financial problems?” 
OR 
“Then you did it because of the way you’ve been treated here?” 
 
Should the accused still not respond to the alternative question with the benchmark 
admission, the interviewer should repeat the questions or variations thereof until the 
benchmark admission is made. It is important for the interviewer to get a response that is 
tantamount to a commitment to confess.  
 
Reinforce Rationalization 
Once the benchmark admission is made, the interviewer should reinforce the confessor’s 
decision. Then the interviewer should make the transition into the verbal confession, where 
the details of the offense are obtained. Reinforcing the rationalization developed earlier will 
help the confessor feel comfortable, believing that the interviewer does not look down  
on him. 
 
  
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.265 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I am glad to hear that you had a good  reason to do this. That reinforces what I 
thought all along — that you were caught up in extraordinary circumstances. When was the first 
time you did it?” 
 
Verbal Confession 
The transition to the verbal confession is made when the accused furnishes the first detailed 
information about the offense. Thereafter, it is the interviewer’s job to probe gently for 
additional details — preferably including those that would be known only to the miscreant. As 
with any interview, there are three general approaches to obtaining the verbal confession: 
chronologically, by transaction, or by event. The approach to be taken should be governed 
by the circumstances of the case.  
 
During the admission-seeking interview, it is best to first confirm the general details of the 
offense. For example, the interviewer will want the accused’s estimates of the amounts 
involved, other parties to the offense, and the location of physical evidence. After these basic 
facts are confirmed, the interviewer can then return to the specifics, in chronological order. 
It is imperative that the interviewer obtain an early admission that the accused knew the 
conduct in question was wrong. This confirms the essential element of intent.  
 
Because of the psychology of confessions, most confessors will lie about one or more 
aspects of the offense, even though confirming overall guilt. When this happens during the 
verbal confession, the interviewer should make a mental note of the discrepancy and 
proceed as if the falsehood had been accepted as truthful.  
 
Such discrepancies should be saved until all other relevant facts are provided by the accused. 
If the discrepancies are material to the offense, then the interviewer should either resolve 
them at the end of the verbal confession or wait and correct them in the written confession. 
If not material, such information can be omitted altogether from the written confession. The 
following items of information should be obtained during the verbal confession: 
 
THE ACCUSED KNEW THE CONDUCT WAS WRONG 
Intent (i.e., the state of mind with which something is done) is required in all matters 
involving fraud. Not only must the confessor have committed the act, he must have known 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.266   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
the conduct was wrong and intended to commit it. This information can be developed as 
illustrated in the following example. 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, now that you have decided to help yourself, I can help you, too. I need to ask you some 
questions to get this cleared up. As I understand it, you did this, and you knew it was wrong, 
but you didn’t really mean to h urt the company, is that right?” 
 
(Note that the question is phrased so that the confessor acknowledges intent, but “didn’t 
mean to hurt” anyone. Make sure the question is not phrased so that the confessor 
falsely says that he “didn’t mean to do it.”) 
 
FACTS KNOWN ONLY TO CONFESSOR 
Once the intent question is solved, the questi oning turns to those facts known only to the 
confessor. These facts include—at a minimum— the accused’s estimates  of the number of 
instances of wrongful conduct as well as the total amount of money involved. The questions 
should not be phrased so that the confessor can answer “yes” or “no.” 
 
ESTIMATE OF NUMBER OF INSTANCES/AMOUNTS 
In fraud matters especially, it is common for the accused to underestimate the amount of 
funds involved as well as the number of instances. This is probably because of a natural 
tendency of the human mind to block out unpleasant matters. Take the figures with a grain 
of salt. If the accused’s response is “I don’t know,” start high with the amounts and 
gradually come down. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, how many times do you think this happened?” 
 
Respondent : 
“I don’t have any idea.” 
 
Interviewer:  
“Was it as many as 100 times?” 
 
  
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.267 
Respondent : 
“No way!” 
 
Interviewer: 
“How about 75 times?” 
 
Respondent : 
“That’s still too high. Probably not more than two or three times.” 
 
Interviewer: 
“Are you pretty sure, Linda?” (If the accused’s estimates are too low, gently get her 
to acknowledge a higher figure. But do not challenge the accused by calling her a 
liar.) 
 
Respondent : 
“Maybe three times, but certainly not more than that.” 
 
MOTIVE FOR OFFENSE 
Motive  is the moving power that prompts a person to act. Motive, however, should not be 
confused with intent, which refers to the state of mind of the accused when performing the 
act. Motive, unlike intent, is not an essential element and criminal law generally treats a 
person’s motive as irrelevant. Even so, motive is relevant for other purposes: it will often 
guide the interviewer to the proper rationalization, it further incriminates the accused, and it 
is important for a successful prosecution. Therefore, it is best that the interviewer elicit the 
suspect’s motive when obtaining a verbal confession. The motive might be the same as the 
theme the interviewer developed earlier—or it  might not. The most common response is “I 
don’t know.” The interviewer should probe for additional information, but if it is not 
forthcoming, then attribute the motive to the theme developed earlier. The motive should be 
established along the lines below. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, we have discussed what might have led you to do this. But I need to hear it in your 
words. Why do you think you did this?”

WHEN OFFENSE COMMENCED 
The interviewer will want to know the approximate date and time that the offense started. 
This is usually developed by a question similar to the following. 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I am sure you remember the first time this happened.” 
 
Respondent : 
“Yes.” 
 
Interviewer: 
“Tell me about it.” 
 
Respondent : 
“Around the middle of January of last year.” 
 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I admire you for having the courage to talk about this. You’re doing the right thing. 
Tell me in detail about the first time.”  
 
WHEN/IF OFFENSE WAS TERMINATED 
In fraud matters, especially internal fraud, the offenses are usually continuous. That is, the 
miscreant seldom stops before he is discovered. If appropriate, the interviewer should seek 
the date the offense terminated. The question is typically phrased as follows. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, when was the last  time you did this?” 
 
OTHERS INVOLVED 
Most frauds are solo ventures—committed wit hout the aid of an accomplice. Rather than 
ask if anyone else was involved, phrase the question something like this. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, who else knew about this besides you?” 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.269 
By asking who else “knew,” the interviewer is  in effect not only asking for the names of 
possible conspirators, but also about others who might have known what was going on and 
failed to report it. This question should not be worded as, “did someone else know?” but rather 
“who else knew?”  
 
OBTAIN PHYSICAL EVIDENCE 
Physical evidence — regardless of how limited it might be — should be obtained from the 
confessor. In many instances, illicit income from fraud is deposited directly in the bank 
accounts of the perpetrator. The interviewer will typically want to ask the confessor to 
surrender his banking records voluntarily for review. It is recommended that either (1) a 
separate written authorization be created, or (2) specific language be added to the  
confession noting the voluntary surrender of banking information. The first method is 
generally preferable. 
 
If there are other relevant records that can be obtained only with the confessor’s consent, 
permission to review those should be sought during the oral confession. In some instances, 
it might be advisable to delay this step until the written confession is obtained. The request 
for physical evidence from the confessor can be set up like this: 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, as a part of wrapping up the details, I will need your banking records (or other 
physical evidence). You understand that, don’t you?” 
 
Respondent : 
“No, I don’t.” 
 
Interviewer: 
“Well, I just need to document the facts and clear up any remaining questions. You have 
decided to tell the complete story, including your side of it. I just want to make sure the facts are 
accurate and fair to you. We want to make sure you’re not blamed for something someone else 
did. And I want to report that you cooperated fully and wanted to do the right thing, 
okay? ”(Avoid the use of the word evidence or references to higher tribunals, such 
as courts or prosecutors.) 
 
  
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.270   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Respondent : 
“Okay.” 
 
Interviewer: 
“Where do you keep your bank accounts?” (If the interviewer knows of at least one 
bank where the confessor does business, the question should be phrased:  “Linda, 
where do you do business besides Florida Marine National Bank?”) 
 
Respondent : 
“Just Florida Marine.” 
 
Interviewer: 
“I’ll need to get your okay to get them from the bank if we need them. Where do you keep the 
original records?” (Do not ask the accused’s permission to look at the records; 
rather, tell her the records are needed. Let the accused object if she has a 
problem with it.) 
 
DISPOSITION OF PROCEEDS 
If it has not come out earlier, the interviewer should find out in general what happened to 
any illicit income derived from the misdeeds. It is typical for the money to have been used 
for frivolous or ostentatious purposes. It is important, however, that the confessor sees his 
actions in a more positive light; the interviewer should avoid comments or questions relating 
to “high living.” 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, what happened to the money?” (Let the accused explain; do not suggest an 
answer unless the confessor does not respond.) 
 
LOCATION OF ASSETS 
In appropriate situations, the interviewer will want to find out if there are residual assets that 
the confessor can use to reduce losses. Rather than ask the accused “is there anything left?” the 
question should be phrased as “what’s left?” 
 
  
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.271 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, what do you have left from all of this?”  
 
Respondent : 
“Not much. I used most of the money to cover my husband’s bills and financial problems. A 
little money and a boat that is paid for is all I have.”  
 
Interviewer: 
“Well, whatever it is, this whole thing will look a lot better if you vol unteered to return what 
you could, don’t you agree?” (Remember do not specifically promise the confessor 
leniency; it will typically invalidate the confession.)  
 
SPECIFICS OF EACH OFFENSE 
Once the major hurdles are overcome, the intervie wer should return to the specifics of each 
offense. Generally, this should simply start with the first instance and work through 
chronologically in a logical fashion.  
 
Because these questions are information seeking, they should be openly phrased so that the 
answer is independent of the question. It is best to seek the independent recollections of the 
confessor first before displaying physical evidence. If the confessor cannot independently 
recall, documents can be used to refresh his recollection. It generally is best to resolve all 
issues on each instance before proceeding to the next. In determining the specifics of the 
offense, the interviewer should usually ask: 
• Who has knowledge of this transaction? 
• What does this document mean? 
• When did this transaction occur? 
• Where did the proceeds of the transaction go? 
• Why was the transaction done? 
• How was the transaction covered up? 
 
Interviewing is a difficult act, seldom mastered without considerable practice. The preceding 
techniques, when properly employed, can immeasurably aid in developing truthful, reliable, 
and legally valid information. 
 
 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.272   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Kinesic Interview and Interrogation 
The kinesic interview or interrogation is a method that has become more popular among the 
law enforcement community in recent years. This type of interview is different than 
traditional interview methods because the interviewer is not necessarily looking for a 
confession from the interview subject. Instead of searching for information from the 
subject, the interviewer is attempting to assess whether the subject is telling the truth by 
reading his body language and other physical manifestations of deception. 
 
In the book The Kinesic Interview Technique, authors Frederick C. Link and D. Glen Foster 
define the kinesic interview technique as: 
 
“[An interview technique] used for gaining information from an individual who is not willingly or 
intentionally disclosing it.” 
 
Link and Foster believe that the kinesic inter view technique is based entirely on the concept 
of stress — an event or circumstance that forces an individual’s mind or body out of 
psychological equilibrium. When stress occurs, humans, like any other living creature, have 
an emotional reaction. Link and Foster refer to this as the “fight or flight syndrome,” in 
which we either run from a stressful situation or brace to face it. Either way, they 
hypothesize, our animalistic tendencies dictate that we must react to stress. When this 
concept is applied to the interview situation, the kinesic interview technique is applied to 
attempt to read the interview subject’s reaction to stress.  
 
This method relies, in a broad sense, on the interviewer’s ability to observe the interview 
subject for signs or symptoms of deceit. The kinesic interview is conducted not just to 
observe what the subject says, but also how the subject says it; the subject’s gestures, 
posturing, facial expressions, and voice inflection are just a few of the traits that an 
investigator looks at. This style of interviewing assumes that when most human beings lie or 
are deceitful to others, they will reveal this deceit through their body language. 
 
These reactions are generally subconscious; in most cases, the interviewee does not even 
realize that he is acting noticeably different. The actions or signs that an interviewer is 
looking for are called meaningful behavior — activities that may suggest that an interviewee is 
under stress. 
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.273 
Link and Foster identify three distinct categories into which meaningful behavior can  
be divided: 
• Self-initiated verbal statements that the interviewee initiates without prompting 
• Prompted verbal responses or statements made by the interviewee in response to 
structured questions asked by the interviewer 
• Nonverbal behavior or body language, which includes body positioning movements, lack 
of movement, and observable physiological changes 
 
Self-Initiated Verbal Statements 
These responses from interviewees are made without any prompting by the interviewer. 
Examples of these statements include changes in speech pattern, overly respectful or friendly 
words directed at the interviewer, or indirect answers and statements. The subject’s speech 
speed will tend to increase, or the subject will hesitate or stammer frequently before giving 
any responses. These verbal clues are a subconscious attempt by the interviewee to dodge 
the line of questioning or suppress the guilty feelings he feels. 
 
Generally, a dishonest person is much more likely to give more self-initiated verbal signs 
than a person who is telling the truth.  
 
Prompted Verbal Responses 
Prompted verbal responses can help an interrogator to differentiate an honest person from a 
deceitful one. By utilizing a series of structured questions, we can generally get a good 
indication of how truthful the subject is. These should be woven into a casual conversation 
so that the subject is not aware of the significance of the questions. The structured questions 
must not appear to be interrogational in manner.  
 
Structured Questions 
The fraud examiner has several types of loaded question to use in the kinesic interview to 
shed light on the guilt or innocence of the interviewee.  
• Punishment question: The interviewer will casually discuss the punishment of the crime’s 
perpetrator with the subject, asking, for example, “What do you think should happen to the 
criminal?” When posed with this sort of question, generally the innocent person, having 
nothing invested in the crime, will answer that the criminal should be severely punished, 
saying something like, “Lock him up and throw away the key.” However, the interview 
subject, if guilty of the crime, will generally answer that the criminal should be treated 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.274   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
fairly, saying for example, “The person who stole that money is very sick and probably needs mental 
help.” In essence, the guilty person is more likely to answer “Don’t hurt me.”  
• Physical evidence question: This type of quest ion is meant to jar the suspect into making 
a mistake. The interviewer will suggest that there is a piece of evidence that might link 
the interviewee to a crime, asking, “Is there any reason that your fingerprints might have been 
found near the crime scene?” This question does not assert that there is any evidence. The 
innocent person, knowing that he had nothing to do with the crime, will simply answer 
“No,” unconcerned about the possible evid ence. The guilty party will often become 
concerned with this possible evidence and attempt to cover for it with another lie. 
• Crime existence question: A variation on this question would be “Do you think that this 
crime was even committed?” The guilty party will see this as a possible way out, and answer 
“no,” while the innocent person will likely answer “yes.” 
 
Nonverbal Behavior/Body Language 
The evaluation of an interview subject’s body lang uage can provide the fraud examiner with 
numerous insights into the subject’s true intentions. Quite often, while an interviewee says 
one thing, his body language tells an entirely different story. The first step in this process is 
to evaluate the “normal” body language of the subject. While we will discuss some general 
tendencies that suggest that a subject is being less than truthful, the interviewer must first 
evaluate the subject’s natural tendencies. Many  people use their hands often when they 
speak, while others do not.  
 
For most people, the head is the most expressive portion of the body. Several facial traits or 
expressions can be read by the interviewer, among them:  
• Eyes: The single most important nonverbal sign that an interviewer must look for and 
recognize are breaks in eye contact by the subject. The subject might close his eyes, 
cover his eyes, or turn or lower his head. Any of these breaks in eye contact during the 
interview can suggest a subject’s deceit. 
• Eyebrow movement: When a subject display’s disb elief or concern during an interview, it 
is often a false or deceptive reaction to the interviewer’s questioning. 
• Touching the face: Many subjects, when under stress, resort to repeatedly touching the 
tip of the nose or rubbing the chin. This is often a nervous reaction to a threatening 
situation. 
• Blushing: A person whose face or cheeks become red is generally experiencing increased 
blood pressure, indicating pressure or stress. 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.275 
• Adam’s apple: The subject’s larynx will quite often move up and down when he is 
concerned or nervous. 
• Carotid arteries: Often the veins in a pe rson’s neck will become exposed when he 
becomes nervous. 
 
In addition, many interviewees will attempt to cover or defend themselves through body 
language by crossing their arms or their legs. This is generally a defensive posture.  
Several factors should be considered when applying kinesic techniques: 
• No single behavior, by itself, proves anything. 
• Behaviors must be relatively consistent when the stimuli are repeated. 
• The interviewer must establish what is normal or baseline behavior for each subject and 
then look for changes from the baseline. These observed changes in the subject’s 
baseline behavior are diagnosed in clusters, not individually. 
• Behaviors must be timely. 
• Observing behavior and interpreting it are hard work. 
• The subjects are watching us while we are watching them. 
• Kinesic interviewing is not as reliable with so me groups as with the general population. 
 
 
Criteria-Based Statement Analysis 
When collecting witness accounts or interviews concerning a particular fraud case, fraud 
examiners must continually assess how honest the interviewee has been. Criteria-based 
statement analysis can be utilized as a tool to uncover just how truthful a subject has been 
after the interview is complete. This technique is different than a kinesic interview in that the 
fraud examiner is not analyzing the body language or nonverbal clues a subject has given, but 
instead the language used by the subject.  
 
Statement analysis is based on the notion that when humans speak, whether intentionally or 
unconsciously, we specifically select the language we use. In general, the verbal clues that a 
subject offers while speaking are just as prominent as any nonverbal tip-offs. The tense that 
an interviewee uses is often the indication that the interviewee knows more than he is  
letting on.  
 
For instance, in the well-publicized case of Susan Smith in 1995, Smith claimed that a 
carjacker forced her out of her car and drove away with her two children in the back seat. 
When the children’s father spoke of the missing toddlers, he spoke of them in present tense; 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.276   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
when Smith mentioned them, investigators noticed that she continually referred to the boys 
in the past tense, indicating that she knew them to be deceased. Upon interrogation, Smith 
confessed to driving the car into a lake, killing her children. 
 
Parts of Speech 
The main items of interest to the fraud examiner during a statement analysis are the 
particular words used by the subject. Breaking down the subject’s sentences carefully may 
reveal many undetected tendencies of the subject’s speech. 
 
Pronouns 
When describing an incident or situation, a truthful subject will most likely use the pronoun 
“I.” If the subject is guilty of an offense or involved in some fashion, that person will 
attempt to distance himself from the situation by removing the “I” from his statement. 
Often, the “I” will be replaced by “we,” as though the subject had little involvement in or 
was not responsible for the situation. 
 
EXAMPLE 
“I went to the grocery store with my girlfriend, but I didn’t steal any of the items.” 
 
“We went to the grocery store, but we didn’t steal anything.”  
 
The subject’s reasoning, subconsciously, is to re move himself from the situation as much as 
possible. By swapping “we” for “I” in the sentences, the perpetrator hopes to deflect 
attention or blame. 
 
In a situation in which the subject uses “we” constantly, the subject is indicating to the 
interviewer that the subject has some sort of relationship with another party in the situation. 
If, for example, the subject continually uses impersonal pronouns, such as “my girlfriend and 
I” rather than “we,” this indicates a lack of  personal involvement with the girlfriend. Fraud 
examiners can utilize this pronoun use to determine whether the interviewee is involved in a 
fraudulent situation with other employees. 
  
Possessive Pronouns 
When an interviewee is giving bogus testimony concerning an event, he will often drop the 
possessive pronoun to shift the blame to an exterior force.  
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.277 
EXAMPLE 
“I got on my register at 10:30. I was working at my register when I was called away by my 
supervisor. When I returned to the register, the register was open and the cash was gone.” 
 
In this statement, the subject referred to the register as “my register” up until the 
controversial act took place. At that point, “my register” becomes “the register,” indicating 
that the subject no longer wants to be associated with a corrupted register. This pronoun 
switch indicates that the subject is being less than truthful. 
 
Verbs 
Verbs are very important pieces of the statement analysis puzzle; the tense that is used by the 
interviewee will shed light on whether the incident has been recalled or improvised. Because 
the subject should be recalling events from the past, the verb tense used to recount the story 
should be past also.  
 
EXAMPLE 
“My wife and I left the house at 7:00, went to dinner, and then saw a movie. We returned to 
the house after the movie was over.” 
 
However, the deceptive interviewee will often change the verb tense at precisely the moment 
at which he is no longer recalling, but rather improvising the event. 
 
EXAMPLE 
“My wife and I left the house at 7:00, went to dinner, and then saw a movie. We return to the 
house and as we pull up to it, we see shattered glass on the driveway.” 
 
Verb tense is also crucial concerning the whereabouts of another person, such as in cases of 
possible kidnapping. If the person interviewed continually refers to the missing person in the 
past tense, there is a good chance that the missing person has been harmed. Again, the Susan 
Smith case is a textbook example of how verb tense usage can lead to a confession. 
 
Balance of the Statement 
When most interview subjects recount an event, their version will be naturally balanced. The 
subject will spend a fairly equal amount of time telling what happened before the event, what 
took place during the event, and what happened during the aftermath. Fraud examiners 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.278   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
should look at the sheer amount of time or number of sentences a subject spends on each 
topic to get a rough estimate of how balanced the account is. If any of the portions of the 
account are exceptionally short, the subject is almost certainly lying. By performing this type 
of analysis, the fraud examiner can also determine what elements are absent from the story 
in a short amount of time. 
 
In the book Criteria-Based Statement Analysis, German psychologists Max Stellar and Guenter 
Koehnken identify a number of separate criteria that the fraud examiner can take into 
consideration when attempting to analyze a just-completed interview. 
 
General Characteristics 
• Logical structure: The fraud examiner first examines the statement for “plot holes,” 
checking to ensure that the recounting of events is chronologically correct and does not 
contain contradictions. 
• Unstructured production: The fraud examiner should examine this criterion at the 
beginning of the interview by allowing the subject to recount the event without influence 
or questioning. Generally, an honest person will not tell an interviewer exactly what has 
taken place in complete chronological order, from start to finish. It is much more likely 
that the initial recounting of events will be told in a scattershot fashion, but that these 
facts and details will eventually mesh into a complete version. When an interview subject 
is able to sit down and initially describe the events that have taken place in complete 
detail, from beginning to end, it is likely that the story has been rehearsed. 
• Quantity of details: An honest subject is more  likely to be able to recall many details 
within an interview than a dishonest subject. When most subjects fabricate a story, they 
are unable to bolster the story with very many details. 
 
Specific Content 
• Contextual embedding: This criterion suggests that a truthful subject’s statement will be 
tightly woven with incidental details, such as the subject’s daily routine, habits, or family 
relationships. A deceptive subject is much less likely to associate an event with seemingly 
insignificant details such as these, choosing to focus only on covering up the major event 
that is being discussed. 
• Descriptions of interaction: The truthful subject is likely to have some description of the 
actions and emotions involved with the described incident or people involved in the 
incident. 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.279 
• Reproduction of conversation: Often, the witness will become animated when repeating 
any conversation related to the incident. When this occurs, the subject is generally telling 
the truth, as it is difficult for a fraudster to create cohesive dialogue on the spot. 
• Unexpected complications during the incident: Descriptions of incidents that disrupt the 
event, such as a sudden halt or interruption of the event, indicate that the subject is 
speaking truthfully. 
 
Peculiarities of Content 
• Unusual details: The appearance of quirky but believable details lends credibility to the 
subject. Fabricated statements rarely contain these types of descriptions. 
• Superfluous details: A subject who provides details that are not essential or even related 
to the recalled event are most often speaking truthfully. A deceitful subject is so 
preoccupied with not telling the truth that he will excise this type of information from 
the story. 
• Accurately reported details misunderstood: When a witness describes details that he does 
not understand or comprehend, but that make sense to the interviewer, the witness is 
most often telling the truth. 
• Related external associations: In this criterion, the interviewer looks for points at which 
the interview subject relates the particular experience with some personal or external 
experiences. When the subject makes a relationship between the event and something 
that has previously occurred in his life, he is very likely being honest. 
• Accounts of subjective mental state: The subject who fills the interview with descriptions 
of feelings and emotions is very likely being truthful. When a subject cannot provide 
such feelings during the interview, this suggests that the subject has not thought through 
his deceptive story very thoroughly. 
• Attribution of perpetrator’s mental state:  The honest subject will often recount the 
perceived mental state of the perpetrator, suggesting what they believe the perpetrator 
was thinking or feeling at the time of the event. 
• Spontaneous corrections: An interview subj ect may often correct himself during the 
course of the interview, making alterations to earlier details or events. When a subject 
does this, he is most often giving truthful testimony. The deceptive subject wants to 
project as honest a façade as possible and do es not want to correct himself, because in 
his mind this gives the appearance of deceit. 
• Admitting lack of memory: This criterion works closely with the previous one, in that an 
honest interviewee will often admit to not remembering certain details. When the 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.280   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
interviewee is lying to the interviewer, he wants to be as complete as possible in covering 
the fraudulent tracks. 
• Raising doubts about one’s own testimony: A deceitful interviewee will almost never 
raise any concerns about whether the testimony given is absolutely correct. If the subject 
raises concerns that he is correct, he is probably telling the truth. 
• Self-deprecation: The mention of any self-incriminating or personally unflattering details 
during the interview suggests that the interviewee is credible. A person who attempts to 
fabricate a story will not want to paint an unsavory picture of himself. 
• Pardoning the perpetrator: Should the intervi ewee attempt to excuse the perpetrator or 
avoid “bashing” the fraudster, the interviewee is likely being honest. 
 
 
The Cognitive Interview Technique 
Police and fraud investigators must often rely on the testimony of witnesses to bring the 
facts of a case together. The testimony of an important witness can determine the entire 
outcome of a fraud case, so it is essential that witnesses’ words be as reliable and detailed  
as possible. 
 
Unfortunately, witnesses are human, and humans are prone to make errors. Fraud 
investigators must understand that in a time of crisis, or even in a situation in which the 
witness was simply not paying close attention, the eyewitness can easily miss acute details. 
Often witnesses have trouble recalling large portions of events simply because they didn’t 
know at the time that they needed to be looking for specific details. Dr. R. Edward 
Geiselman and Dr. Ronald P. Fisher write in the National Institute of Justice article  
Interviewing Victims and Witnesses of Crime  that “most victims and eyewitnesses ... are so 
occupied with the event that they do not have the time to try to learn or memorize details 
about a suspect at the time of the crime.”  
 
Because of these problems, different techniques for filling out the witnesses’ testimony have 
been developed to assist the investigator. One of the first techniques developed was the use 
of hypnosis on witnesses. The notion behind this approach was that an investigator could 
open the mind of a witness and pick into his subconscious for specific details. The merits of 
this technique are highly debatable and have been hotly contested in courts of law. 
 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.281 
But more recently, the cognitive interview technique was developed to serve much the same 
purpose. This approach has proven far more effective than questionable hypnosis techniques 
and has been deemed a reliable method in the court of law.  
 
The cognitive interview technique was established, researched, and fine-tuned by Dr. 
Geiselman, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and other colleagues in 
the psychiatric profession. Geiselman and others have written numerous articles and 
governmental documents detailing the extensive research dealing with the interviewing  
of witnesses.  
 
Geiselman believes that the cognitive interview should be split into two distinct phases: the 
narrative phase and the specific-detail phase. When these phases are used in succession 
during an interview, it is likely that an investigator will come away from an interview with an 
excellent witness account of an event. The narrative phase deals more with “what happened” 
during the event; the specific-detail phase works more to track down who was involved and 
obtain specific details about the suspect. 
 
The Narrative Phase 
The first portion of the cognitive interview is the narrative phase, in which the witness tells 
the “whole story.” The investigator should first allow the witness to recount the situation, 
using several steps to guide the narrative portion. There are four primary steps in the 
narrative phase of the cognitive interview: 
• Reconstruct the circumstances of the event. 
• Instruct the eyewitness to report everything and be complete. 
• Recall the events in different orders. 
• Change perspectives. 
 
Reconstruct the Circumstances of the Event 
In this first, important step, the interviewer should ask the eyewitness to describe the context 
in which the incident occurred. The interviewer should ask the witness to describe 
everything, including the weather, time of day, and look and feel of the environment in 
which the incident took place. What did the people and/or objects in the surroundings  
look like?  
 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.282   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
The objective of this step is to mentally return the witness to the scene so that he will vividly 
recall the unfolding events. Asking the witness to describe the emotional state he was in at 
the time of the occurrence often helps accomplish this first step. 
 
Instruct the Eyewitness to Report Everything and Be Complete 
In this stage, the interviewer should ask the eyewitness to recount every last detail as 
completely as possible. Geiselman says that a witness will often withhold information that he 
thinks may be relevant to the investigation. Therefore, the investigator should instruct the 
witness not to omit anything when giving testimony, no matter how trivial the information 
might seem. The small details that the witness remembers during the interview may not be 
directly beneficial to the investigation, but they will be important to helping the witness 
remember the events descriptively and thoroughly. 
 
Recall the Events in Different Orders 
Constructing the event in a different order will give the witness the freedom to completely 
recreate the event. When recounting the event in sequential order, the witness may very well 
forget minute details in an effort to describe what happened next. If the witness constructs 
the event from the single moment or thing that left the greatest impression on him, the 
interviewer may gain a foothold on the witness’s perspective. 
 
Change Perspective 
The final step of the cognitive interview process is to get the witness to alter his perspective 
of the event. The investigator should ask him to reconstruct the scenario and assume a 
different position within the situation. For instance, ask the witness to pretend to be a 
different person within the event, and recount the event from that perspective. What was the 
other person thinking or feeling? This technique may seem a bit odd, but it may allow the 
witness to consider various elements of the event that he previously had not.  
 
Specific Details 
Once the narrative portion of the interview is comp leted, it is likely that the investigator will 
have questions about specific details. Geiselman and his contemporaries have developed five 
techniques to cultivate specific details and items of information from the witness. The five 
categories are: 
• Physical appearance 
• Names 
• Numbers 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.283 
• Speech characteristics 
• Conversation 
 
Physical Appearance 
The investigator can often elicit additional information about the event by asking the witness 
to describe the suspect. A particularly effective technique is to ask the witness whether the 
suspect reminded the witness of anyone he knows. Often, physical descriptions, such as the 
type of clothing a suspect was wearing or the particular way a suspect walked or looked, will 
not be presented during the narrative phase of the interview. This additional information, 
however, can be key to linking a suspect with a specific crime. 
 
Names 
Often, the name of the suspect or another person will be spoken during an event, but many 
times the event proves too traumatic or happens too quickly for a witness to recall. If a 
witness cannot remember any names spoken during the event ask him to attempt to recall 
the first letter of the suspect’s name (or any other names spoken) by going through the 
alphabet one letter at a time.  
 
Number 
Once the witness has possibly established the first letter of the suspect’s name, the 
investigator should ask the witness how many syllables or letters were in the name. 
Establishing whether the name was long or short may effectively jar the witness’s memory.  
 
Speech Characteristics 
The investigator can also ask the witness what types of speech characteristics the suspect 
has. Geiselman again suggests asking the witness whether the suspect’s speech reminds the 
witness of anyone else. The interviewer should also determine whether the suspect had any 
specific accent, an awkward or unusual voice, or used any words repeatedly during the event. 
 
Conversation 
The witness should be asked whether anything that the suspect or anyone else said during 
the event elicited an unusual response. Did the suspect or any other witnesses react in a 
strange manner to anything that was said?  
 
The extensive research that Geiselman and his colleagues have done on the cognitive 
interview technique has shown that the technique improves the recall performance of

witnesses when compared to the standard interview techniques. The emphasis is on the 
witness’s recollection of details to give investigators a more complete picture of what actually 
happened during a specific event.

innoc peopl from guilti a culpabl individu will frequent confess dure the
admissionseek phase of an interview while an innoc person will not do so unless
threat or coercion ar us in some instanc the onli wai to differenti the culpabl

the second purpos is to obtain a valid confess confess under the law must be

even if the accus is present with an appropri ration it is like that he will
continu to want to deni culpabl when the interview is success in stop denial
the accus normal will then turn to variou reason why he could not have commit the
act in question the purpos of thi stage is to convinc the accus of the weight of the
evid against him miscreant usual have a keen interest in materi that tend to
implic them alibi gener can be diffus us on of the method list below
displai physic evid
it is common for most guilti peopl to overestim the amount of physic evid the
interview want to try and reinforc thi notion in the wai the evid is laid out to the
accus the physic evid usual document in fraud matter gener should be
displai on piec at a time in revers order of import in thi wai the full extent of
the evid is not immedi known by the accus when the accus no longer deni
culpabl the interview should stop displai evid
each time a document or piec of evid is laid out to the accus it signific should
be note by the interview dure thi phase the accus is still try to come to grip
with be caught the interview should therefor expect that the accus will attempt to
lie hi wai out of the situat like denial the interview should stop the alibi and other
falsehood befor thei ar fulli articul

discuss wit
anoth techniqu for diffus alibi is to discuss the testimoni of wit the object
is to give enough inform about what other peopl would sai without provid too
much ideal the interview statement will creat the impress in the mind of the
accus that mani peopl ar in a posit to contradict hi stori
the interview is again caution about furnish enough inform to the accus so
that he can identifi the wit thi might place the wit in a difficult posit and the
accus could contact the wit in an effort to influenc testimoni the accus could
take repris against potenti wit though thi is rare

dure the admissionseek interview it is best to first confirm the gener detail of the

involv other parti to the offens and the locat of physic evid after these basic
fact ar confirm the interview can then return to the specif in chronolog order
it is imper that the interview obtain an earli admiss that the accus knew the
conduct in question wa wrong thi confirm the essenti element of intent
becaus of the psycholog of confess most confessor will lie about on or more
aspect of the offens even though confirm overal guilt when thi happen dure the

proce as if the falsehood had been accept as truth
such discrep should be save until all other relev fact ar provid by the accus

pronoun
when describ an incid or situat a truth subject will most like us the pronoun

the cognit interview techniqu
polic and fraud investig must often reli on the testimoni of wit to bring the
fact of a case togeth the testimoni of an import wit can determin the entir
outcom of a fraud case so it is essenti that wit word be as reliabl and detail
as possibl
unfortun wit ar human and human ar prone to make error fraud
investig must understand that in a time of crisi or even in a situat in which the
wit wa simpli not pai close attent the eyewit can easili miss acut detail
often wit have troubl recal larg portion of event simpli becaus thei didnt
know at the time that thei need to be look for specif detail dr r edward
geiselman and dr ronald p fisher write in the nation institut of justic articl
interview victim and wit of crime that most victim and eyewit ar so
occupi with the event that thei do not have the time to try to learn or memor detail
about a suspect at the time of the crime
becaus of these problem differ techniqu for fill out the wit testimoni have
been develop to assist the investig on of the first techniqu develop wa the us
of hypnosi on wit the notion behind thi approach wa that an investig could
open the mind of a wit and pick into hi subconsci for specif detail the merit of
thi techniqu ar highli debat and have been hotli contest in court of law
investig interview theori and applic
2011 fraud examin manual 3281
but more recent the cognit interview techniqu wa develop to serv much the same
purpos thi approach ha proven far more effect than question hypnosi techniqu
and ha been deem a reliabl method in the court of law
the cognit interview techniqu wa establish research and finetun by dr
geiselman a professor at the univers of california lo angel and other colleagu in
the psychiatr profess geiselman and other have written numer articl and
government document detail the extens research deal with the interview
of wit
geiselman believ that the cognit interview should be split into two distinct phase the
narr phase and the specificdetail phase when these phase ar us in success
dure an interview it is like that an investig will come awai from an interview with an
excel wit account of an event the narr phase deal more with what happen
dure the event the specificdetail phase work more to track down who wa involv and
obtain specif detail about the suspect
the narr phase
the first portion of the cognit interview is the narr phase in which the wit tell
the whole stori the investig should first allow the wit to recount the situat
us sever step to guid the narr portion there ar four primari step in the
narr phase of the cognit interview
reconstruct the circumst of the event
instruct the eyewit to report everyth and be complet
recal the event in differ order
chang perspect
reconstruct the circumst of the event
in thi first import step the interview should ask the eyewit to describ the context
in which the incid occur the interview should ask the wit to describ
everyth includ the weather time of dai and look and feel of the environ in
which the incid took place what did the peopl andor object in the surround
look like
interview theori and applic investig
3282 2011 fraud examin manual
the object of thi step is to mental return the wit to the scene so that he will vividli
recal the unfold event ask the wit to describ the emot state he wa in at
the time of the occurr often help accomplish thi first step
instruct the eyewit to report everyth and be complet
in thi stage the interview should ask the eyewit to recount everi last detail as
complet as possibl geiselman sai that a wit will often withhold inform that he
think mai be relev to the investig therefor the investig should instruct the
wit not to omit anyth when give testimoni no matter how trivial the inform
might seem the small detail that the wit rememb dure the interview mai not be
directli benefici to the investig but thei will be import to help the wit
rememb the event descript and thoroughli
recal the event in differ order
construct the event in a differ order will give the wit the freedom to complet
recreat the event when recount the event in sequenti order the wit mai veri well
forget minut detail in an effort to describ what happen next if the wit construct
the event from the singl moment or thing that left the greatest impress on him the
interview mai gain a foothold on the witnesss perspect
chang perspect
the final step of the cognit interview process is to get the wit to alter hi perspect
of the event the investig should ask him to reconstruct the scenario and assum a
differ posit within the situat for instanc ask the wit to pretend to be a
differ person within the event and recount the event from that perspect what wa the
other person think or feel thi techniqu mai seem a bit odd but it mai allow the
wit to consid variou element of the event that he previous had not
specif detail
onc the narr portion of the interview is comp lete it is like that the investig will
have question about specif detail geiselman and hi contemporari have develop five
techniqu to cultiv specif detail and item of inform from the wit the five
categori ar
physic appear

2011 fraud examin manual 3283
speech characterist
convers
physic appear
the investig can often elicit addit inform about the event by ask the wit
to describ the suspect a particularli effect techniqu is to ask the wit whether the
suspect remind the wit of anyon he know often physic descript such as the
type of cloth a suspect wa wear or the particular wai a suspect walk or look will
not be present dure the narr phase of the interview thi addit inform
howev can be kei to link a suspect with a specif crime
name
often the name of the suspect or anoth person will be spoken dure an event but mani
time the event prove too traumat or happen too quickli for a wit to recal if a
wit cannot rememb ani name spoken dure the event ask him to attempt to recal
the first letter of the suspect name or ani other name spoken by go through the
alphabet on letter at a time
number
onc the wit ha possibl establish the first letter of the suspect name the
investig should ask the wit how mani syllabl or letter were in the name
establish whether the name wa long or short mai effect jar the witnesss memori
speech characterist
the investig can also ask the wit what type of speech characterist the suspect
ha geiselman again suggest ask the wit whether the suspect speech remind the
wit of anyon els the interview should also determin whether the suspect had ani
specif accent an awkward or unusu voic or us ani word repeatedli dure the event
convers
the wit should be ask whether anyth that the suspect or anyon els said dure
the event elicit an unusu respons did the suspect or ani other wit react in a
strang manner to anyth that wa said
the extens research that geiselman and hi colleagu have done on the cognit
interview techniqu ha shown that the techniqu improv the recal perform of
