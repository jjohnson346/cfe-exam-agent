Interviewing Suspects and Signed Statements

Establish Rationalization 
Once the accusation has been made, repeated, and denials are stopped, it is time for the 
interviewer to establish a morally acceptable rationalization that will allow the accused to 
square the misdeed with his conscience. It is not necessary that this theme be related to the 
underlying causes of the misconduct. It is common and acceptable for the accused to explain 
away the moral consequences of the action by seizing onto any plausible explanation other 
than being a “bad person.” 
 
If the accused does not seem to relate to one theme, the interviewer should go on to another 
until one seems to fit. Thereafter, that theme should be developed fully. Note that the theme 
development explains away the moral?but not the legal—consequences of the misdeed. 
The interviewer is cautioned not to make any statements that would lead the accused to 
believe he will be excused from legal liability by cooperating.  
 
The questions posed in the examples, rather than being confrontational, constantly seek 
agreement from the accused. The interviewer must strike a balance between being in control 
of the interview and still appearing compassionate and understanding. Again, no matter what 
conduct the accused has supposedly committed, the interviewer should not express shock, 
outrage, or condemnation. 
 
UNFAIR TREATMENT 
Probably the most common explanation for criminal activity in general, and internal fraud in 
particular, is unfair treatment and the accused’s attempt to achieve equity. Studies have 
shown that counter-productive employee behavior—including stealing—is motivated 
primarily by job dissatisfaction. Employees and others feel that “strik ing back” is important 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.256   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
to their self-esteem. The sensitive interviewer can capitalize on these feelings by suggesting 
to the accused that he is a victim. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I feel like I know what makes you tick. And I know it isn’t like you to do something 
like this without a reason. You have worked hard here to get a good reputation. I don’t think 
the company has paid you what you’re really worth. And that’s the way you feel too, isn’t it?” 
OR 
“Linda, I’ve seen situations like this before. And I think the company brought this on 
themselves. If you had been fairly treated, this wouldn’t have happened, don’t you agree?” 
 
INADEQUATE RECOGNITION 
Some employees might feel that their efforts have gone completely without notice by the 
company. As with similar themes, the interviewer should be empathetic. 
 
 EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I have found out a few things about you. It looks to me that you have given a lot more 
to this company than they have re cognized. Isn’t that right, Linda?” 
 
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS 
Internal criminals, especially executives and upper management, frequently engage in fraud 
to conceal their true financial condition — either  personal or business. Here are examples of 
how to develop a theme involving financial problems as a motive. In the following example, 
E. J. is an executive of a company and is suspected of fraud.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“ E. J., I was astonished to find out some of your investments have taken such a beating. I don’t 
know how you managed to keep everything afloat as  well as you did. You just did this to stay 
alive financially, didn’t you, E. J.?” 
OR 
“ E. J., I have found out what you’ve been paid around here and, frankly, I was surprised. I 
thought it might be a lot more. No wonder you had to get involved in this. You pretty much 
needed to do this to survive, didn’t you?”

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.257 
ABERRATION OF CONDUCT 
Many miscreants believe their conduct constitutes  an aberration in their lives and that it is 
not representative of their true character. The interviewer might establish this theme by 
applying the following examples. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I know this is totally out of character for you. I know that this would never have 
happened if something wasn’t going on in your life. Isn’t that right, Linda?” 
OR 
“ E. J., you’ve worked hard all your life to get a good reputation. I feel you wouldn’t normally 
have done something like this; it  just doesn’t fit unless you felt like you were forced into it. You 
felt forced to do this, didn’t you, E. J.?” 
 
FAMILY PROBLEMS 
Some people commit fraud because of family problems — financial woes caused by divorce, 
an unfaithful spouse, or demanding children. Men especially — who have been socially 
conditioned to tie their masculinity to earning power — might hold the notion that wealth 
connotes family respect. For their part, women have been found to commit white-collar 
crime in the name of their responsibility to the needs of their husbands and children. The 
skillful interviewer can convert this motive to his advantage by applying one of the following 
approaches. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I know you have had some family problems. I know your recent divorce has been 
difficult for you. And I know how it is when these problems occur. You never would have done 
this if it hadn’t been for family problems; isn’t that right, Linda?” 
OR 
“E. J., someone in your position and with your ethics just doesn’t do things like this without a 
reason. And I think that reason has to do with trying to make the best possible life for your 
family. I know it would be difficult for me to admit to my family that we’re not as well off as we 
were last year. And that’s why you did this, isn’t it, E. J.?”

ACCUSER’S ACTIONS 
Don’t disclose the accuser’s identity if it is not already known. But in cases where the 
accuser’s identity is known to the accused, it can be helpful to blame the accuser for the 
problem. The accuser can be a colleague, manager, auditor, fraud examiner, or any similar 
person. Alternatively, the problem can be blamed on the company. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, you know what these auditors are like. They are hired to turn over every stone. I 
wonder how they would look if we put them under  a microscope. Compared to other things that 
are going on, what you’ve done isn’t that bad. Right, Linda?” 
OR 
“ E. J., I really blame a large part of this on the company. If some of the things that went on 
around this company were known, it would make what you’ve done seem pretty small in 
comparison, wouldn’t it, E. J.?” 
 
STRESS, DRUGS, AND ALCOHOL 
Employees will sometimes turn to drugs or alcohol to reduce stress. In some instances, the 
stress itself will lead to aberrant behavior in a few individuals. A rationalization established 
by the interviewer could be similar to the following. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I know what you’ve done isn’t really you. Inside, you have been in a lot of turmoil. A 
lot of people drink too much when they have problems. I have been through periods like that 
myself. And when things build up inside, it sometimes makes all of us do something we 
shouldn’t. That’s what happened here, isn’t it, Linda?” 
OR 
“E. J., you’re one of the most respected men in this company. I know you have been under 
tremendous pressure to succeed. Too much pressure, really. There is only so much any of us can 
take. That’s behind what has happened here, isn’t it, E. J.?” 
 
REVENGE 
Similar to other themes, revenge can be effectively developed as a motive. In this technique, 
the interviewer attempts to blame the offense on the accused’s feeling that he must “get 
back” at someone or something. 
Investigation  Interview Theory and Application 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.259 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, what has happened is out of character for you. I think you were trying to get back at 
your supervisor for the time he passed you over for a raise. I would probably feel the same. 
That’s what happened, isn’t it, Linda?” 
OR 
“E. J., everyone around here knows that the board has not supported you in your efforts to turn 
this company around. I would understand if you said to yourself, ‘I’ll show them.’ Is that what 
happened, E. J.?” 
 
DEPERSONALIZING THE VICTIM 
In cases involving employee theft, an effective technique is to depersonalize the victim. The 
accused is better able to cope with the moral dilemma of his actions if the victim is a faceless 
corporation or agency. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, it isn’t like you took something from a friend or neighbor. I can see how you could say, 
‘Well, this would be okay to do as long as it  was against the company,  and not my coworkers.’ 
Is that right, Linda?” 
OR 
“E. J., it’s not like what you’ve done has really  hurt one person. Maybe you thought of it this 
way: ‘At most, I’ve cost each shareholder a few cents.’ Is that the way it was, E. J.?” 
 
MINOR MORAL INFRACTION 
The interviewer in many cases can reduce the accused’s perception of the moral seriousness 
of the matter. This is not to be confused with the legal seriousness. Fraud examiners and 
interviewers should be careful to avoid making statements that could be construed as 
relieving legal responsibility. For example, the examiner should not state: “It is not a big deal, 
legally. It’s just a technical violation.” Instead, the interviewer should play down the moral side. 
One effective way is through comparisons, such as those illustrated below. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, this problem we have doesn’t mean you’re Jack the Ripper. When you compare what 
you’ve done to things other people do, this situation seems pretty insignificant, doesn’t it?” 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation  
3.260   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
OR 
“E. J., everything is relative. What you’ve done doesn’t even come close to some of the other 
things that have happened. You’re not Bernie Madoff, right E. J.?” 
OR 
“I could see myself in your place. I probably wo uld have done the same thing, wouldn’t I?” 
 
ALTRUISM 
In many cases, the moral seriousness of the matter can be reduced by claiming the action 
was for the benefit of others. This is especially true if the accused views himself as a  
caring person. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I know you didn’t do this for yourself. I have looked into this matter carefully, and I 
think you did this to help your husband, didn’t you?” 
OR 
“E. J., you have a big responsibili ty in this company. A lot of people depend on you for their 
jobs. I just know you did this because you thought you were doing the right thing for the 
company, didn’t you?” 
 
GENUINE NEED 
In a very small number of cases, fraud is predicated by genuine need. For example, the 
accused might be paying for the medical care of sick parents or a child. Or some other 
financial disaster might have befallen the miscreant. In those cases, the following techniques 
might be effective. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I don’t know many people who have had so many bad things happen all at once. I can 
see where you thought this was pretty much a matter of life or death, right, Linda?” 
OR 
“E. J., you’re like everyone else: you have to put food on the table. But in your position, it is 
very difficult to ask for help. You genuinely needed  to do this to survive, didn’t you, E. J.?”
