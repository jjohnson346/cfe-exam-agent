Documenting Results  
Expound the notes from the results of questioning as soon as possible after concluding the 
interview — preferably immediately afterward. If this procedure is followed, the examiner will 
not have to take copious notes during the interview. Law enforcement officials are generally 
required to maintain notes. In the private sector, the notes can usually be destroyed once a 
memorandum has been prepared summarizing the interview. (See the Law section of the 
Fraud Examiners Manual  for more information.)
