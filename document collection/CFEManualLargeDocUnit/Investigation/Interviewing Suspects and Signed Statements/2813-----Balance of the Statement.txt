Balance of the Statement 
When most interview subjects recount an event, their version will be naturally balanced. The 
subject will spend a fairly equal amount of time telling what happened before the event, what 
took place during the event, and what happened during the aftermath. Fraud examiners 
Interview Theory and Application  Investigation

should look at the sheer amount of time or number of sentences a subject spends on each 
topic to get a rough estimate of how balanced the account is. If any of the portions of the 
account are exceptionally short, the subject is almost certainly lying. By performing this type 
of analysis, the fraud examiner can also determine what elements are absent from the story 
in a short amount of time. 
 
In the book Criteria-Based Statement Analysis, German psychologists Max Stellar and Guenter 
Koehnken identify a number of separate criteria that the fraud examiner can take into 
consideration when attempting to analyze a just-completed interview.
