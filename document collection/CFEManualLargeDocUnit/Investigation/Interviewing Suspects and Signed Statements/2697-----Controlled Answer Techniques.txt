Controlled Answer Techniques 
Controlled answer techniques or statements might be used to stimulate a desired answer or 
impression. These techniques direct the interview toward a specific point. For example, it 
might be possible to get a person to admit knowledge of a matter by phrasing the question 
like this, “I understand you were present when the internal controls were developed; would you please describe 
how they were constructed?” This phrasing provides a stronger incentive for the respondent to 
admit knowledge than does, “Were you present when the internal controls were developed?” 
 
To stimulate the person to agree to talk or provide information, you might use a prompt, 
such as, “Because you are not involved in this matter, I am sure you would not mind discussing it with me.” 
This provides a stronger incentive to cooperate than, “Do you have any objections to telling me 
what you know?” Avoid negative construction, such as, “I don’t guess you would mind answering a 
few questions?”
