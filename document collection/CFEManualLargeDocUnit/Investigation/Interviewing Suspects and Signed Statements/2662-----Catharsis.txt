Catharsis 
Catharsis is the process by which a person obtains a release from unpleasant emotional 
tensions by talking about the source of these tensions. We often feel better by talking about 
something that upsets us. Although we are all familiar with the frequent necessity for 
catharsis in ourselves, we do not always perceive the same need in others. The need for 
sympathetic understanding and the need for catharsis are related, but they are not the same 
thing. The interviewer who does not have time to listen to what he considers inconsequential 
or egocentric talk will often find the respondent unwilling to share important consequences.
