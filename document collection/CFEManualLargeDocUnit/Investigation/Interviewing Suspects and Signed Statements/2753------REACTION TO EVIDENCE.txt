REACTION TO EVIDENCE 
While trying to be outwardly concerned, the guilty person will have a keen interest in 
implicating evidence. The dishonest person will often look at documents presented by the 
interviewer, attempt to be casual about observing them, and then shove them away, as if 
wanting nothing to do with the evidence. 
 
Most actions that are designed to interrupt the flow of speech are stress related. Examples 
include:  
• Closing the mouth tightly 
• Pursing the lips 
• Covering the mouth with the hand 
• Lip and tongue biting 
• Licking the lips 
• Chewing on objects 
 
Genuine smiles usually involve the whole mouth; false ones are confined to the upper half. 
People involved in deception tend to smirk rather than to smile.
