Etiquette 
The etiquette barrier operates when an answer to the interviewer’s question contains 
information perceived by the respondent as inappropriate. Answering candidly would be 
considered in poor taste or evidence of a lack of proper etiquette. For example, there are 
certain things that men do not discuss in front of women and vice versa, things that students 
do not tell teachers, and things that doctors do not tell patients. The desire to avoid 
embarrassing, shocking, or threatening answers is distinct from the fear of exposing oneself. 
Often, the negative effects of the etiquette barrier might be forestalled by selecting the 
appropriate interviewer and setting for the interview.
