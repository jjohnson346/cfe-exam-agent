the conduct was wrong and intended to commit it. This information can be developed as 
illustrated in the following example. 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, now that you have decided to help yourself, I can help you, too. I need to ask you some 
questions to get this cleared up. As I understand it, you did this, and you knew it was wrong, 
but you didn’t really mean to h urt the company, is that right?” 
 
(Note that the question is phrased so that the confessor acknowledges intent, but “didn’t 
mean to hurt” anyone. Make sure the question is not phrased so that the confessor 
falsely says that he “didn’t mean to do it.”)
