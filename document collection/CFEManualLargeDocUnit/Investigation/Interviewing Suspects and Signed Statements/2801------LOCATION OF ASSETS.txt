LOCATION OF ASSETS 
In appropriate situations, the interviewer will want to find out if there are residual assets that 
the confessor can use to reduce losses. Rather than ask the accused “is there anything left?” the 
question should be phrased as “what’s left?”

EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, what do you have left from all of this?”  
 
Respondent : 
“Not much. I used most of the money to cover my husband’s bills and financial problems. A 
little money and a boat that is paid for is all I have.”  
 
Interviewer: 
“Well, whatever it is, this whole thing will look a lot better if you vol unteered to return what 
you could, don’t you agree?” (Remember do not specifically promise the confessor 
leniency; it will typically invalidate the confession.)
