WHEN OFFENSE COMMENCED 
The interviewer will want to know the approximate date and time that the offense started. 
This is usually developed by a question similar to the following. 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I am sure you remember the first time this happened.” 
 
Respondent : 
“Yes.” 
 
Interviewer: 
“Tell me about it.” 
 
Respondent : 
“Around the middle of January of last year.” 
 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, I admire you for having the courage to talk about this. You’re doing the right thing. 
Tell me in detail about the first time.”  
 
WHEN/IF OFFENSE WAS TERMINATED 
In fraud matters, especially internal fraud, the offenses are usually continuous. That is, the 
miscreant seldom stops before he is discovered. If appropriate, the interviewer should seek 
the date the offense terminated. The question is typically phrased as follows. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Interviewer: 
“Linda, when was the last  time you did this?”
