COPIERS AND SCANNERS 
Like some printers, copiers and other multifunction machines may have internal storage 
devices that store relevant data. In fact, almost every copier built since 2002 has a hard drive 
that stores images of documents the machines have copied, scanned, or e-mailed. Some 
copiers store user access records and a history of copies made. And, as with most file 
systems, it may be possible to retrieve information from a copier’s hard drive that has been 
deleted. As a result, copiers may be brimming with important information.
