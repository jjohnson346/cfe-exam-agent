The Document Expert’s Findings 
A forensic document examiner cannot determine with accuracy the writer’s age, sex, race, 
which hand was used, physical or mental condition, personality, or character from 
handwriting examinations. There are three basic outcomes of forensic handwriting 
comparisons. 
 
Non-Identification  
The suspected person did not write the signature or other writings on the questioned 
document. 
 
Identification  
The suspected person did write the signature or other writings on the questioned document.

Inconclusive  
No definite determinations were possible as to whether the suspected person did or did not 
write the signature or other writings on the questioned document. This outcome is often the 
result of insufficient or inadequate handwriting samples of the suspect or when a photocopy 
rather that the original document is submitted to the expert for examinations.  
 
Though inconclusive, some writings might contain sufficient characteristics in common to 
indicate possible identity, or sufficient differences to indicate that the suspected person 
might not have prepared the writings. The expert might suggest additional leads for the 
fraud examiner that could resolve the inconclusive results of the comparisons.
