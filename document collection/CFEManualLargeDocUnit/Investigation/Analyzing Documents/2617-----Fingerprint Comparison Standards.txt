Fingerprint Comparison Standards 
The fingerprints of millions of people are on record in repositories of fingerprint cards 
maintained by law enforcement agencies throughout the world. These cards contain the 
inked fingerprints of people who have been arrested, served in the military, applied for 
employment at various levels of government, and volunteered their fingerprints to assist in 
personal identification in the event of their deaths. Many of these fingerprint databases have 
been computerized and are linked by networks. However, millions of people do not fit in 
any of these categories and have never been fingerprinted. 
  
If a suspect has never been fingerprinted or refuses to voluntarily furnish inked print 
samples, it might be necessary for the fraud examiner to obtain a legal court order directing 
the suspect to furnish inked prints for identification purposes. Even though the evidence 
items might have been handled by several people, they might still bear latent prints of the 
guilty party. If the items have been inadvertently handled by other known people, including 
the fraud examiner, then inked prints of all of those people should also be obtained and 
submitted to the fingerprint expert along with the evidence items and the inked prints  
of suspects.
