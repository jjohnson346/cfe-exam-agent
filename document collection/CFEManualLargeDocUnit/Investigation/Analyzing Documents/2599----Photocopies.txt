Photocopies 
Increasingly, photocopies are retained as “original” records of documents (particularly in 
outgoing correspondence files) and can become the only evidence of a document because 
the original document cannot be located or, in some cases, cannot be released, such as in the 
case of official public records 
 
Fraud examiners and other investigators sometimes submit a copy of a document for 
examination because they do not wish to part with the original. As a result, the document 
examiner will probably not be able to determine features and reach conclusions that could 
have been made from the original document. When at all possible, the fraud examiner 
should obtain the original document for the document examiner and should not submit  
a copy. 
 
Identifying the Source of a Photocopy 
Photocopies can be the actual original evidence in the case of: 
• Anonymous letters 
• Unauthorized “leaks” of information in the fo rm of copies of letters, memoranda, files, 
and other records 
• Copies made to conceal forgeries or to insert or manipulate text 
• Spurious “disinformation” dissemination of phony official documents 
 
Locating the source of a copy can be crucial in some investigations. It is sometimes possible 
to determine what kind of copier was used to produce the copy in question. Some types of 
machines leave minute markings, indentations, and other features on the copy that will assist 
the expert in determining the brand and model of the machine used. It is also possible to 
identify the particular machine used by examining the pattern of unique and identifiable 
“trash marks” (specks, spots, streaks, edge markings, etc.) it leaves on copies and comparing 
them with copies from a known machine. The fraud examiner should be aware, however, 
that some of these markings have permanence while others are transient and temporary.

Permanent “Trash Marks”  
These uniquely identifiable markings on copies are usually caused by accidental deep 
scratches and imperfections in the copier’s glass surface or document cover, in the printing 
element surface, or other permanent machine parts that are not readily replaced or changed 
during servicing of the machine. These marks can be reproduced on copies for years until 
the machine is repaired or the part replaced. 
 
Transient “Trash Marks”  
Trash marks are uniquely identifiable markings on copies. They are usually caused by dirt, 
smudges, or small bits of foreign matter on or in machine surfaces that will appear until the 
machine is cleaned or serviced. These markings prove not only that a particular machine was 
used to produce the copy, but that documents that share the same transient trash marks 
might have been produced at approximately the same time. This is one of several ways to 
determine when a document was prepared. 
 
Taking Photocopier Samples 
First, without placing any document in the machine, make six “blank” copies. As the 
machine produces each “copy,” remove it, turn it over and on the reverse side initial and 
number each copy in the same sequence they were produced by the machine (these copies will 
reproduce all “trash marks” made by the machine, including the entire document cover, glass 
surface, and internal printing element surface. Six sample copies are needed since different 
models of machines have varying printing element surface sizes, usually ranging in size from 
one to three sheet impressions before repeating on the same area of the surface). 
 
Second, place a ruler or other calibrated measuring device on the glass document surface, 
close the cover, and make six copies. (These copies will permit a determination of the 
standard amount of reduction or enlargement the machine makes when in the “actual size” 
or one-to-one mode.) If the machine requires documents to be fed into it, rather than having 
a glass document surface, use any sample document available as an “original” and include 
that sample document along with the copies of it. On the reverse of each copy, initial and 
number the copies in the same sequence they were produced by the machine, as outlined in 
the first step. 
 
Third, place a sample document containing both typewritten and handwritten text on the 
glass document surface in the standard position, close the document cover, and again print

six copies, initialing and numbering as previously directed. Also include the sample 
document with the copy samples. 
 
Place all of the sample copies and sample documents into a large sturdy paper or cardboard 
envelope or folder (do not use a plastic envelope) on which you have previously noted the 
make, model, and location of the machine. Initial, date, and seal the envelope and submit it 
to the document examiner along with the questioned evidence documents.
