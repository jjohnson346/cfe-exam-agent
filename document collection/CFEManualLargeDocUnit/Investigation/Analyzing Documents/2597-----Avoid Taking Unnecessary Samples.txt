Avoid Taking Unnecessary Samples 
Fraud examiners do not have to be experts to make preliminary eliminations of some 
suspect typewriters and narrow down the number of typewriters they might have to take 
samples from. Although there are hundreds of different fonts in use on computer printers, 
traditional manual and some electronic typewriters might be eliminated by differences in 
their typeface designs. 
  
Although fonts might appear to be very similar, the observant fraud examiner can 
differentiate between them by concentrating on those letters and numerals that most often 
differ. Note first whether the letter styles on the evidence document and the typewriter are 
serif (the letters have small horizontal bars at the top and bottom of the letters, like little feet) 
or sans serif (no small bars). If they differ, then the typewriter is not the one used. Next, look 
at the shapes of the letters and numerals. Pay particular attention to the small letters f, g, r, t, 
and w, and the numerals 2, 3, 4, and 5. If any of those differ in shape, then the typewriter is 
not the one used.
