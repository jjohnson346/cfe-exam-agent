Fingerprints 
Latent (non-visible) prints are left on surfaces by the body oils, salts, and amino acids 
clinging to or exuded by friction ridges in the skin on fingers, palms of the hands, and soles 
of the feet and are unique personal identifiers. Latent prints might also be deposited on 
surfaces by hands, fingers, and bare feet through the transfer of oils and greases. Patent 
(visible) prints are sometimes deposited on surfaces by hands, fingers, and bare feet through 
the transfer of materials such as blood, paint, soot, and soil. 
  
Latent prints absorbed into protected porous sur faces, such as paper in files or pages in 
books, have been known to survive for decades and still be identifiable after chemical 
development. However, latent fingerprints on hard, non-porous surfaces can be destroyed or 
deteriorate rapidly if handled; not protected fr om the environment; or exposed to high 
temperatures, humidity, or water. 
 
Fraud examiners should wear protective gloves or carefully use tweezers when handling 
latent fingerprint evidence to avoid smudging and contamination. Tweezers should not be 
used on documents if indented writing or photocopier examinations are planned.  
 
Fingerprints on Paper or Other Absorbent Porous Surfaces 
Fraud examiners should never try to develop latent fingerprints that have been absorbed into 
paper or other porous materials by dusting with fingerprint powder or any other means. 
 
Such efforts will not only be unsuccessful, but will prevent additional examinations. Preserve 
the evidence by placing the item into a plastic bag or cellophane protector. Label the 
container with the examiner’s initials, the date, and an identifying exhibit number. Experts 
will use various methods on these materials, including iodine fuming and brushing or 
spraying silver nitrate solution or ninhydrin spray, which reacts with the body chemicals and 
other substances in the latent print that have soaked into the absorbent surface. Some of 
these methods will permanently discolor a document.

Fingerprints on Hard, Non-Porous Surfaces 
Items with hard, non-porous surfaces, such as plastic, metal, and glass, can be dusted for the 
presence of latent fingerprints left on their surfaces. Special fingerprint dusting powders and 
lifting materials are available from law enforcement suppliers. The dry, powdered toner used 
in some photocopy machines has also been used successfully for fingerprint dusting. 
 
After dusting the surface and locating a suspected print or partial print, blow or gently brush 
off the excess powder. Remove the developed print with adhesive lifting tape and place the 
tape on an index card that contrasts in color with the dusting powder used. Mark the card 
with initials, the date, an identifying exhibit number, and where the print was found.  
 
Some latent prints on non-porous surfaces might not be developed by the dusting method. 
If possible, rather than dusting the item, the fraud examiner should retain it; place it in a 
protective container; initial, date, and label the container with an identifying exhibit number; 
and submit it to a fingerprint expert for processing. Rather than dusting, fingerprint experts 
might use cyanoacrylate (“super-glue”) fuming or a laser to successfully develop and 
photograph the latent prints on some materials, such as black plastic bags.  
 
Fingerprint Comparison Standards 
The fingerprints of millions of people are on record in repositories of fingerprint cards 
maintained by law enforcement agencies throughout the world. These cards contain the 
inked fingerprints of people who have been arrested, served in the military, applied for 
employment at various levels of government, and volunteered their fingerprints to assist in 
personal identification in the event of their deaths. Many of these fingerprint databases have 
been computerized and are linked by networks. However, millions of people do not fit in 
any of these categories and have never been fingerprinted. 
  
If a suspect has never been fingerprinted or refuses to voluntarily furnish inked print 
samples, it might be necessary for the fraud examiner to obtain a legal court order directing 
the suspect to furnish inked prints for identification purposes. Even though the evidence 
items might have been handled by several people, they might still bear latent prints of the 
guilty party. If the items have been inadvertently handled by other known people, including 
the fraud examiner, then inked prints of all of those people should also be obtained and 
submitted to the fingerprint expert along with the evidence items and the inked prints  
of suspects.
