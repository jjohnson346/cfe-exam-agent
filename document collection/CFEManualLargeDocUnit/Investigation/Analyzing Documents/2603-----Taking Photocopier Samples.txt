Taking Photocopier Samples 
First, without placing any document in the machine, make six “blank” copies. As the 
machine produces each “copy,” remove it, turn it over and on the reverse side initial and 
number each copy in the same sequence they were produced by the machine (these copies will 
reproduce all “trash marks” made by the machine, including the entire document cover, glass 
surface, and internal printing element surface. Six sample copies are needed since different 
models of machines have varying printing element surface sizes, usually ranging in size from 
one to three sheet impressions before repeating on the same area of the surface). 
 
Second, place a ruler or other calibrated measuring device on the glass document surface, 
close the cover, and make six copies. (These copies will permit a determination of the 
standard amount of reduction or enlargement the machine makes when in the “actual size” 
or one-to-one mode.) If the machine requires documents to be fed into it, rather than having 
a glass document surface, use any sample document available as an “original” and include 
that sample document along with the copies of it. On the reverse of each copy, initial and 
number the copies in the same sequence they were produced by the machine, as outlined in 
the first step. 
 
Third, place a sample document containing both typewritten and handwritten text on the 
glass document surface in the standard position, close the document cover, and again print

six copies, initialing and numbering as previously directed. Also include the sample 
document with the copy samples. 
 
Place all of the sample copies and sample documents into a large sturdy paper or cardboard 
envelope or folder (do not use a plastic envelope) on which you have previously noted the 
make, model, and location of the machine. Initial, date, and seal the envelope and submit it 
to the document examiner along with the questioned evidence documents.
