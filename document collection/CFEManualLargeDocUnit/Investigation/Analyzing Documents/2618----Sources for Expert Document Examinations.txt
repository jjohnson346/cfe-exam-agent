Sources for Expert Document Examinations 
 
Law Enforcement Laboratories 
In cases where criminal prosecutions are likely, there are excellent forensic laboratories 
available through law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and national levels of the 
criminal justice system. 
 
Forensic Document Experts in Private Practice 
When an expert’s services are needed, a fraud examiner can identify and locate fully 
qualified, court-certified, expert forensic document examiners available in a particular 
geographical area by contacting the following organizations:

Graphologists (Graphoanalysts) 
Graphology (graphoanalysis) has been described as a pseudoscience whose practitioners 
have the purported ability to determine a person’s character, moral traits, personality, and 
mental state based upon an analysis of that person’s handwriting. Graphology is often 
erroneously confused with forensic document examinations, especially by the media. Fraud 
examiners should be aware that some people who practice graphological analyses might have 
little academic and scientific training. They might be self-taught or graduates of a 
correspondence course. Since a conclusive accuracy level has not been established for those 
examinations, expert testimony by graphologists is often rejected by the courts. Fraud 
examiners should be cautious in relying on handwriting identifications made by some of 
these “handwriting experts.”
