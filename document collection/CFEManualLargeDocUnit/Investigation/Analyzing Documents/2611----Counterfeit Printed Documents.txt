Counterfeit Printed Documents 
Most documents that have monetary value, such as currency, bank checks, traveler’s checks, 
money orders, bearer bonds, postage stamps, gift certificates, or lottery tickets, have all been 
counterfeited at one time or another. Identity documents are also often counterfeited, for 
example, passports, birth certificates, drivers’ licenses, and government and commercial 
employee identity cards. Other counterfeited documents include commercial product labels, 
business stationery and forms, business logos, motor vehicle titles and registration forms,

and safety inspection stickers. Despite most preventive measures, if a document has any 
value it can be, and probably has been, counterfeited. Counterfeiting has become big 
business, especially in some third-world countries, where the latest developments in printing 
technology are being used to produce large quantities of high-quality counterfeit documents 
and “knock-off” phony products in violation of international copyright and trademark laws. 
 
Counterfeiting Methods 
The days of old-style counterfeiters — who were skilled artisans who carefully etched 
counterfeit printing plates — are over. Today most counterfeit documents are prepared by 
various photo-reproduction processes such as the photo-offset printing process 
(lithography) and flexography, which uses rubberized printing “plates.” These processes 
begin with the photographic reproduction of a genuine document. The photographic 
negatives are then carefully retouched to remove the filled-in text, serial numbers, and other 
distinguishing features that appeared on the genuine document. Printing plates are then 
made from the retouched negatives, and counterfeit copies are printed from the plates.  
 
Rapidly advancing technology now allows larcenous novices with no commercial printing 
experience to use sophisticated computerized scanners, computer graphics software, 
multicolor computer printers, and full-color photocopy machines to produce relatively high-quality 
counterfeit documents. 
 
Detecting Counterfeits 
Many counterfeits can be detected by making a side-by-side comparison with a 
corresponding genuine document. Be alert for different versions or form revisions. Look for 
subtle differences in ink colors and brilliance, different types of paper substrate, the use of 
different typestyles and type sizes (fonts), and evidence of the retouching the text on the 
genuine document used in the reproduction. The retouching will be most evident in areas 
where text, serial numbers, and the like are superimposed on a background design, especially 
if they are printed in black ink. 
 
When furnished with genuine documents for comparisons with suspected counterfeits, 
forensic document examiners can also make expert differentiations between the printing 
processes, ink formulations, and paper substrates used. In some instances it has been 
possible for the experts to reconstruct portions of the filled-in text or serial numbers that 
appeared on the genuine document, but were removed in the retouching process. In this 
fashion the specific original document used by the counterfeiter can sometimes be

determined. By tracing the history of the document’s ownership, the counterfeiter can be 
located and identified. Treatment of the original genuine document for latent  
fingerprints might positively identify the counterfeiter and other people who handled the 
genuine document.
