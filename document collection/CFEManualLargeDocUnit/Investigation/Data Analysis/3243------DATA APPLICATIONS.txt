DATA APPLICATIONS 
With IDEA’s data applications, users can exercise extraction or exception testing to identify 
items that satisfy a specific characteristic, The Equation Editor allows you to create simple or 
very complex extractions, and the @Functions are used to perform more complex 
calculations and exception testing. The Search function can seek text or numeric values 
across selected fields in multiple databases using standard or advanced search techniques. 
IDEA Duplicates can identify items within a database in which up to eight fields of 
information are the same. Users can also search for gaps in numeric sequence or 
alphanumeric sequences with a user-defined mask. The Chart Data option allows data files 
to be graphed or test results exhibited in bar, stacking bar, pie, plot, or area charts. Data 
Action Fields allow users to set up relationships across multiple files.
