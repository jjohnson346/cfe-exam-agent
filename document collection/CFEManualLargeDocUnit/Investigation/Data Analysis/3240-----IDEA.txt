IDEA  
Like ACL, IDEA (Interactive Data Extraction and Analysis) is a generalized audit software 
program. More specifically, it is a PC-based file interrogation package that allows 
accountants, auditors, and financial managers to view, sample, and analyze data from any 
other computerized system. This software provides some functionality previously only 
available to electronic data processing (EDP) auditors and systems specialists. IDEA lets the 
user make inquiries of data files, perform random unit sampling, and calculate totals and 
averages. The software will perform specific criteria searches, unusual item queries, and 
identify gaps or duplicates in sequences. Additionally, to differentiate normal audit patterns 
from suspect ones, examiners can use IDEA to perform data analysis using Benford’s Law.  
 
Additionally, IDEA includes a number of tools to prevent and detect fraud, including 
personal vetting tools, the power to authorize transactions independently, and the ability to 
observe employees. This software considers purchasing, payroll, and banking the most 
common places for the occurrence of fraud.
