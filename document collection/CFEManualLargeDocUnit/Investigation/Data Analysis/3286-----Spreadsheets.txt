Spreadsheets 
When a CaseMap file is created, the program auto matically sets up a series of spreadsheets 
used to organize critical case knowledge. These spreadsheets can be used to organize 
information about the facts, documents, characters, issues, and case law in every case.

FACTS SPREADSHEET 
The facts spreadsheets include a case chronology in which the investigator can enter facts, 
dates, times, and the source of each piece of information. Investigators can also distinguish 
between disputed and undisputed facts and keep track of the status of each item. 
 
 
 
OBJECTS SPREADSHEET 
The objects spreadsheet allows investigators to organize the cast of characters—a list of the 
individuals and organizations involved in the case, and it should also catalog key documents 
and other important pieces of physical evidence.

ISSUE SPREADSHEET 
The issue spreadsheet provides an outline of the issues, including both legal claims and 
critical factual disputes. The outline can be any number of levels deep.  
 
QUESTION SPREADSHEET 
Because many questions occur during the early stages of an investigation, the question 
spreadsheet allows users to filter and sort their open items using various criteria.  
 
RESEARCH SPREADSHEETS 
CaseMap has three research spreadsheets: Authorities, Extracts from Authorities and a 
combination of Authorities and Extracts. The research spreadsheets will organize and 
explore the user’s knowledge about the precedents and statutes relevant to their case, and it 
include links to actual case law using the authorities and extracts. The authorities spreadsheet 
can be used to manage top-level information about precedents, statutes, and other types of 
case research. The extracts spreadsheet can be used to capture details about particular 
sections of interest excerpted from important case law and statutes.
