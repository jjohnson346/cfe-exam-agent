Using Data Analysis Software 
 
Advantages of Using Data Analysis Software 
There are five significant advantages to using data analysis software. First, data analysis 
software allows the fraud examiner to centralize an investigation, relying less on others to 
gather pertinent information. Because of the amount of information data mining software is 
able to sort through, the examiner no longer has to rely on different sources for information. 
In the past, when analyzing a company’s books for possible discrepancies, the examiner 
would have to ask for the assistance of several persons within the accounting department to 
locate the pertinent information. Now, however, the data analysis program will do all the 
“leg work,” ensuring an above-the-board investigation without many variables. 
 
Second, data analysis software allows the fraud examiner to ensure that an investigation is 
accurate and complete. In the past, an audit or fraud examination could only be complete to 
the extent that the investigator was able to sift through information. When looking at one 
month’s worth of a company’s transactions, a fraud examiner might be forced to research 
more than one million transactions. Given the amount of time an auditor generally has to 
conduct a single examination, the depth of a manual audit can be suspect at best. By using a 
data analysis program, the fraud examiner can run several different analysis patterns in a 
matter of hours, enabling him to look at greater volumes of information from a number of 
different angles. These procedures lead to a more comprehensive examination. 
 
Third, data analysis allows the fraud examiner to base predictions about the probability of a 
fraudulent situation on reliable statistical information. By utilizing data mining software, the 
fraud examiner can base any strong suspicions of fraudulent activities on hard numbers. 
Because the software will compare one month’s expenditures with the same data for the rest 
of the months of the year, the fraud examiner can point conclusively to troubled areas. With 
Investigation  Data Analysis and Reporting Tools 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.605 
hard data to support a fraud examiner’s suspicions, a company is more likely to conduct 
further investigations into the wrongdoing. 
 
Fourth, data analysis allows the fraud examiner to search entire data files for red flags of 
possible fraud. The number of checkpoints a fraud examiner can set up using a data analysis 
program is staggering. By cutting down on the paperwork involved in an investigation, the 
fraud examiner is able to execute a number of different searches and analyses of the 
company’s raw data.  
 
Finally, data analysis can assist the fraud examiner in developing reference files for ongoing 
fraud detection and investigation work. By performing audits and examinations with data 
analysis software, the fraud examiner will begin to recognize trends and set up a list of 
precedents for individual accounting situations, such as a monthly statement reconciliation. 
In doing so, the fraud examiner can establish a “norm” with which to compare individual 
months or years. These precedents can also be used by the fraud examiner in general terms, 
and the knowledge can be applied to nearly any fraud investigation. 
 
Core Data Analysis Software Functions 
Computers can scan database information for several specific types of information, creating 
a red-flag system. To perform this, most software packages use a combination of different 
functions. These functions are: 
• Sorting 
• Record selection 
• Joining files 
• Multi-file processing 
• Correlation analysis 
• Verifying multiples of a number 
• Compliance verification 
• Duplicate searches 
• Vertical ratio analysis 
• Horizontal ratio analysis 
• Date functions 
• Graphing

Sorting 
To sort means to arrange data in a meaningful order. Sorting is nothing new; most reports 
you read are sorted in some way. With sorted data, you can quickly pick out what is 
important. An investigator can ask a program to sort information using different methods, 
such as alphabetically or numerically. For instance, when searching for a suspected 
fraudster’s name out of thousands in a check disbursement file, the software can quickly sort 
a list of payee names.

Investigation  Data Analysis and Reporting Tools 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.607 
Record Selection  
Specific record selection is accomplished by a request or query of the computer to find the 
occurrences of items or records in a field. This type of request will only return instances 
where the record did occur, effectively reducing large amounts of information into concise 
lists. Often, additional criteria placed on the record selection or query will reveal a more 
pertinent list of information. Most data analysis programs include simple Find macros to 
help locate specific records.  
 
Joining Files  
The Join function gathers together the specified parts of different data files. Joining files 
combines fields from two sorted input files into a third file. Join is used to match data in a 
transaction file with records in a master file, such as matching invoice data in an accounts 
receivable file to a master cluster. For example, you may need to compare two different files 
to find differing records between files. The following is an example of how joining two files 
can easily provide that information.

Multi-File Processing  
Multi-file processing allows the user to relate several files by defining relationships between 
multiple files, without the use of the Join command. A common data relationship would be 
to relate an outstanding invoice master file to an accounts receivable file based on the 
customer number. The relationship can be further extended to include an invoice detail file 
based on invoice number. This relationship will allow you to see which customers have 
outstanding invoices sorted by date.  
Data Analysis and Reporting Tools  Investigation 
3.608   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Correlation Analysis 
Using this function, investigators can determine the relationships between different variables 
in the raw data. Investigators can learn a lot about computer data files by learning the 
relationship between two variables. For example, we should expect a strong correlation 
between these independent and dependent variables because a direct relationship exists 
between the two variables. Hotel costs should increase as the number of days traveled 
increases. The gallons of paint used should increase as the number of houses built increases. 
You can probably use many more of such relationships. 
 
Independent Variable Dependent Variable 
Number of days traveling Hotel cost 
Number of documents printed Reams of paper used 
Number of houses built Paint used 
 
Verifying Multiples of a Number 
With this function, an auditor can determine whether regularly disbursed checks, such as 
reimbursement for mileage, are consistent within the regular rate. For instance, if the mileage 
checks do not measure up to the 30-cents-per-mile rate, a red flag should automatically be 
raised. 
 
Compliance Verification 
This function determines whether company policies are met by employee transactions. If a 
company limits the amount of its reimbursements, the software can check to see that this 
limit is being observed. Many times fraud exam iners can find early indications of fraud by 
testing detail data for values above or below specified amounts. For example, when 
employees are out of town, do they adhere to the company policy of not spending more 
than $30 a day for meals? For starters, we can look at the expense reports and select those 
with meal expenses exceeding $30. With the in formation returned from this simple query, we 
have a starting point for suspecting fraud. Even though these variances are small ($2 and $3), 
the time taken to research small variances can be well invested. The trail might lead to 
something big. After further investigation, you might learn that the employee did not have 
supporting documentation to submit because a vendor’s sales representative paid for all the 
meals. If this is the case, you have two fraud suspects, the employee and the employee’s boss 
who approved the report.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.609 
Duplicate Searches 
Fraud examiners and auditors can perform searches on invoice disbursements numerically to 
see if any invoices have been paid twice. By cross-checking the invoices with the vendors 
paid, duplicate billing can be easy to catch. 
 
Vertical Ratio Analysis 
Vertical analysis is a technique for analyzing the relationships between the items on an 
income statement, balance sheet, or statement of cash flows by expressing components as 
percentages. In the vertical analysis of an income statement, net sales is assigned 100 percent; 
on a balance sheet, total assets or total liabilities and equity is assigned 100 percent. All other 
items are expressed as a percentage of these two numbers.  
 
By performing this function, you can determine whether paid expenditures over a period are 
reasonable amounts. If one area of company expenses seems abnormally large for a short 
amount of time, a red flag should immediately be raised. 
 
Horizontal Ratio Analysis 
Horizontal analysis is a technique for analyzing the percentage change in individual financial 
statement items from one year to the next. The first year in the analysis is considered the 
base year, and the changes to subsequent years are computed as a percentage of the base 
year.  
 
This function determines the trends of a company’s expenses, inventory, and so on. 
Discrepancies in a company’s net profit or a large shift in amount of inventory would 
suggest that something is not right within the company.

Date Functions 
Various software programs allow you to check for differences in dates, such as invoice dates. 
By verifying that check disbursements are consistent, you can ensure that no suspicious 
payments were arranged by an employee. Analysis programs will also allow for aging of data. 
The following is an example of accounts receivable aging.

Graphing 
Graphs, like pictures, are worth a thousand words. Data analysis programs can provide 
numerous types of graphs to give fraud examiners a quick glimpse of the data. For example 
an inquiry should be made as to why November expenses are $10,000 more than the 
monthly norm.

Data Analysis Checklist 
The following are some key issues to address as one conducts a data analysis. 
• Ensure data validity and data integrity. There is always a concern when the examiner 
moves data from one venue to another. One of the concerns is data validity. Is the data 
valid and pertinent to the investigation? The second concern is integrity. Is the valid data 
that was selected correct? A simple check or au dit of the validity and integrity of the data 
should be the first step in the data analysis.    
• Consider data format and structure. This consideration is important when the examiner 
wishes to import or export data with his computer. A date can be formatted into a 
number of different styles, such as mm/dd/yyyy. The structure of the data will also be 
important along with the extension. A text file will have a .txt extension associated with 
it. What format is the current data in? What format will the computer require? How does 
the examiner get the data from here to there if the data formats and structures are 
different? 
• Count the zeros. The examiner should perform a preliminary analysis to ensure that the 
key strategic issue he is about to develop is worth the effort before initiating his fraud 
investigation. 
Data Analysis and Reporting Tools  Investigation 
3.614   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• Consider the spectrum of distinct levels of aggregation at which fraud monitoring is 
required. Determine the lowest level (transaction level), the highest level (multiparty 
criminal conspiracies), and the intervening layers that may be present in your industry 
and respective data. 
• Begin with the end in mind. In his book, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen 
Covey states that beginning with the end in mind is good habit. When you develop your 
fraud intelligence action plan, be certain to consider the end result. One question to ask 
may be, “Will this algorithm/consultant hold up under the intense scrutiny of a court of 
law?”  
 
Evaluating Data Analysis Software 
In short, there are no silver bullets. But any data analysis software should possess the 
following minimum requirements: 
• Data import/export capabilities. Considering your data format and structure, how easily 
is data imported/exported? 
• Data visualization. How easy is it to move your data from a spreadsheet into a graphic 
for analysis and interpretation? 
• Look for a suite of tools. Just as there is not one screwdriver for every job, there is not 
only one software program for the examiner’s  fraud intelligence efforts. Therefore, he 
should choose the most appropriate set of tools according to his data and then select the 
software that best fits his current and future needs.  
• Develop a two-pronged effort of using the computer to acquire fraud intelligence. Use 
commercial software currently on the market and begin collaborative activities with the 
academics at your local university. There are numerous software packages in various 
stages of development in academia that are in need of data to be tested. This can prove 
to be a win-win for both parties. The examiner has the data and the academics have the 
prototype software. 
 
Evaluating Data Mining Software 
Because no single software tool can satisfy all user purposes, examiners must consider the 
applications with respect to their particular needs. Ken Collier, an expert in data 
warehousing, business intelligence, software engineering, and agile methods, and his 
colleagues established a framework for evaluating data mining.3 The framework divided the 
criteria into the following four areas: 
                                                 
3  Collier, K, Carey, B, Sautter, D. and Marjaniemi, C. “A Methodology for Evaluating and Selecting data Mining 
Software,” Proceedings of the 32nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 1999, IEEE.

• Performance : Performance refers to the ability to handle a variety of data sources.  
• Functionality : Functionality refers to the variety of capabilities, technical methods, and 
methodology for data mining included in the program.  
• Usability : Usability refers to the conformation of different levels and types of users 
without losing usefulness or functionality. 
• Support of ancillary activities : Ancillary task support permits the user to perform the variety 
of tasks that support data mining.  
 
Evaluating Data Mining Consultants 
If, however, an entity intends to use a data mining consultant, the following qualities should 
be assessed: 
• Innovation : How does the individual stay current? Look for professional associations, 
publications, and training in your area of investigation.  
• Creativity : Can the individual work in a creative environment, such as fraud intelligence? 
Can the individual work unsupervised and be expected to produce results? Since fraud is 
a moving target, how has a past client’s platfo rm altered from the original investigation? 
Why/how did that occur? What were the results?  
• Experience : Does the individual have experience in the type of investigation you are 
planning? Does the individual have experi ence in the type of software/tools you are 
planning to use? Does the individual have experience in the type of data you have? 
 
The embodiment of this expertise might take one, two, three, or more people. You really 
need people who understand what it is they are looking for—and what they can do with it 
once they find it.
