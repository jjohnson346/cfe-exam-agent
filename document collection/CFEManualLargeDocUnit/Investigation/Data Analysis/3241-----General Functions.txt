General Functions 
IDEA’s general functions are discussed below.  
 
FILES, FILE MANAGEMENT, AND FILE MANIPULATION 
IDEA’s file management and manipulation applications allow the user to import/export files 
from almost any format, including XML and specific accounting packages; use an easy, 
industry-standard file management program; generate a single database from several other

databases; use a compare-database option to identify differences in a numeric field within 
two files for a common key; combine fields from two databases into a single database to test 
for data matches across files; and use the append-databases option, concatenate two or more 
files into a single database for audit testing.  
 
DATA APPLICATIONS 
With IDEA’s data applications, users can exercise extraction or exception testing to identify 
items that satisfy a specific characteristic, The Equation Editor allows you to create simple or 
very complex extractions, and the @Functions are used to perform more complex 
calculations and exception testing. The Search function can seek text or numeric values 
across selected fields in multiple databases using standard or advanced search techniques. 
IDEA Duplicates can identify items within a database in which up to eight fields of 
information are the same. Users can also search for gaps in numeric sequence or 
alphanumeric sequences with a user-defined mask. The Chart Data option allows data files 
to be graphed or test results exhibited in bar, stacking bar, pie, plot, or area charts. Data 
Action Fields allow users to set up relationships across multiple files. 
 
SAMPLING 
IDEA offers five sampling methods with the ability to calculate sample sizes based on 
parameters entered and evaluate the results of sampling tests. The sampling methods 
available are systematic, random, stratified random, monetary unit, and classical variables 
sampling.  
 
ANALYSIS 
IDEA’s analysis applications allow users to apply Benford’s Law, stratification, 
summarization, aging, and pivot tables to raw data.  
 
PRODUCTIVITY 
With the productivity application, there are several different functions that can display the 
data, save the operations carried out on a database, generate statistics for all numeric and 
date fields within a database, and create a script with the help of object-oriented 
programming language.
