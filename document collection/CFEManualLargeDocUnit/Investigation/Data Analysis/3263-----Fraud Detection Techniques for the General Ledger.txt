Fraud Detection Techniques for the General Ledger 
STRATIFY GENERAL LEDGER DETAIL INFORMATION 
Look at the multitude of activities in a gene ral ledger and ask yourself, “How can I survey 
this data in an extremely quick manner while efficiently planning my audit?” This test should 
provide the answer because it helps the auditor focus on large-dollar postings, while 
assessing the administrative burden of maintaining low-dollar activity. 
 
The stratification report should be reviewed for: 
• Unreasonably large balances for which the activity could be queried for recalculation and 
proper classification 
• A high number of transactions with low accumulated activity for possible consolidation 
• Planning detailed testing of the journal entry approval process

JOURNAL ENTRY GAP TESTS 
Gaps may signal incomplete data processing or, in the situation of journal entries, possible 
hidden entries. Usually, a method of documenting these occurrences, along with a review by 
an independent party, is sufficient to ensure the completeness and accuracy of processing. 
However, it is rare that a journal entry gap test is performed in the accounting department (it 
is more common in the accounts payable area related to the check sequence), so this may be 
the first time this test is being performed. 
 
Gaps in the journal entry sequence should be reviewed with the accounting department. The 
test work should answer the following questions: 
• What procedures are in place to document and approve all gaps in the sequences? 
• How are gaps communicated to management? 
 
IDENTIFY NONSTANDARD JOURNAL ENTRIES MADE IN A TIMEFRAME AFTER YEAR 
END RELATED TO SPECIFIC ACCOUNTS 
Nonstandard journal entries are generally those that are posted manually, rather than 
through an automated feed from a fixed asset or accounts receivable sub-ledger. Such entries 
are more prone to error and fraud mainly due to human error, the judgment applied to 
support the entry, and the possibility of an override by management in authorizing the entry. 
This is especially true for entries made just after year end (related to the prior year), as these 
entries are more prone to be adjustments for the fiscal year’s annual reporting. 
 
Given the above, the test for these entries should include: 
• Reviewing the journal entry and associated supporting documentation 
• Ensuring the approvals are appropriate for the size and nature of the journal entry 
• Assessing whether generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are being applied 
 
SUMMARIZE ACTIVITY BY USER ACCOUNT 
This test looks for: 
• Standard names such as “default” or “test.” These names usually have equally simple 
passwords for a hacker to guess and should generally be avoided. Replacements to these 
generic user IDs would be specific IDs associated with the person using the system (e.g., 
“jsmith”). 
• Unrecognized or terminated employees. This test focuses on the responsiveness within 
the MIS function to ensure that only authorized employees have system access. Compare 
the list created by this test to an active employee roster to spot any violations.

• Users who have access beyond their level of responsibility. This access may highlight a 
nonsegregation of duties in which a person has an opportunity to commit fraud by being 
able to initiate, authorize, and/or record a transaction. 
 
The resulting report should be reviewed bearing in mind the above considerations. 
Recommended steps include: 
• Delete default passwords and replace them with specific IDs 
• Delete employees who are not on the active employee roster 
• Review users who are posting high activity or who may have access to other non-
 segregated functions and assess whether other controls are needed to mitigate the such 
individuals’ access
