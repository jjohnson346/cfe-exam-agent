Multi-File Processing  
Multi-file processing allows the user to relate several files by defining relationships between 
multiple files, without the use of the Join command. A common data relationship would be 
to relate an outstanding invoice master file to an accounts receivable file based on the 
customer number. The relationship can be further extended to include an invoice detail file 
based on invoice number. This relationship will allow you to see which customers have 
outstanding invoices sorted by date.
