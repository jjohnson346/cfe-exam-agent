CALCULATE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHIP AND INVOICE DATES, AS WELL AS INVOICE DATES WITH NO SHIPMENTS 
Untimely, erroneous, and/or fraudulent sales invoices may be detected if invoices are sent 
without valid shipments. In this case, revenue is potentially being recorded prior to being 
earned. Further research of these invoices should be done independent of the sales and 
accounts receivable functions in order to ensure an independent analysis.
