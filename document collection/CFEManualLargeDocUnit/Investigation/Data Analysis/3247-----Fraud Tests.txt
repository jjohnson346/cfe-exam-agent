Fraud Tests 
Fraud examiners and auditors can use IDEA’s data  analysis applications to identify potential 
signs of fraud. The following are a few examples of the types of fraud schemes that 
examiners can identify with IDEA’s data analyses applications.   
 
EMPLOYEE FRAUD 
• Identify employee accounts at financial institutions that have excess numbers of credit 
memos.  
• Identify employee accounts at financial institutions that have large deposits. 
• Compare employee home addresses, Social Security numbers, telephone numbers, and 
bank routing and account numbers to those of vendors from vendor master file. 
• At financial institutions, compare employee Social Security numbers against those of 
deposit and loan accounts to identify those not properly coded as employee accounts. 
• Analyze all debits to income accounts, particularly debit memos. 
• Monitor the activity in suspense accounts, including the age of suspense items and the 
rolling of similar amounts. 
• Analyze claims paid by corporate medical insurance providers. 
• Obtain a Social Security number listing from an outside vendor to test for valid Social 
Security numbers and determine whether the holder is alive or deceased. 
 
QUESTIONABLE INVOICES 
• Identify invoices without a valid purchase order. 
• Look for invoices from vendors not in the approved-vendor file. 
• Find invoices for more than one purchase order authorization. 
• Identify multiple invoices with the same item description. 
• Extract vendors with duplicate invoice numbers. 
• Look for multiple invoices for the same amount on the same date. 
• Find invoice payments issued on non-business days (Saturday and Sundays). 
• Identify multiple invoices at or just under approval cut-off levels. 
 
PHANTOM VENDOR SCHEMES 
• Match names, addresses, phone numbers,  and Social Security numbers between 
employee and vendor files. 
• Check vendor addresses against mail drop address lists.

KICKBACK OR CONFLICT OF INTEREST SCHEMES 
• Look for vendor prices greater than the standard. 
• Identify price increases greater than acceptable percentages. 
• Check for continued purchases in spite of high rates of returns, rejects, or credits. 
• Look for high volume purchases from one vendor. 
 
DORMANT ACCOUNT SCHEMES 
• Check that all applicable accounts have been flagged as dormant. 
• Identify dormant accounts with activity. 
• Check for transfers from dormant accounts to employee accounts. 
• Check changes of addresses on dormant accounts. Cross-check new addresses with 
employee addresses. 
 
MONEY LAUNDERING SCHEMES 
• Identify accounts with large average values of transactions. It is common for there to be 
a small number of high-value transactions through an account being used for money 
laundering. 
• Identify matched debit and credit transactions on the same account within a short time 
period.  
• Search for large, rounded transaction values. 
• Identify multiple accounts for particular individuals. 
• Identify large cash deposits. 
• Test customer identification procedures by searching for missing data fields, such as date 
of birth, Social Security number, or driver’s license number. 
• Cross check customer addresses against mail drop address lists.
