RE: [Fraud Detection and Deterrence Review] 
 
Dear Mr./Ms. [                  ]: 
 
Pursuant to our discussion, XYZ & Associates (X YZ) is pleased to present this proposal to 
the ABC Company (the Company) to perform a review of the Company’s policies and 
procedures to detect and deter fraud. 
 
This review is designed to assist in determining the Company’s procedures concerning 
adequate fraud detection and deterrence methods. This review cannot be relied upon to 
provide assurances that fraud does not or will not exist within the company. Rather, it is 
designed to highlight weaknesses, if any, in the existing system. A potential review by XYZ 
would also provide management with recommendations for a proactive fraud deterrence 
program. 
 
The fee for these services will be $______ plus ex penses, which include, but are not limited 
to, travel, telephone, photocopying, and facsimile charges. One half of the fee is due upon 
signing this letter and the other half upon delivery of the report. All expenses will be billed at 
the conclusion of each month and are due upon receipt. Any invoice remaining outstanding 
for more than 30 days will be subject to a rebilling charge. 
 
Please review this proposal. If this proposal  meets with your approval, please sign and return 
one copy along with your check for $ ______ in the enclosed envelope. If you have any 
questions, please do not hesitate to call. Thank you. 
 
Sincerely yours,
