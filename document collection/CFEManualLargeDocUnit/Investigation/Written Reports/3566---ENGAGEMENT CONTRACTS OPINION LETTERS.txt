Pursuant to our discussion, XYZ & Associates (X YZ) is pleased to present this proposal to 
the ABC Company (the Company) to perform a review of the Company’s policies and

This review is designed to assist in determining the Company’s procedures concerning 
adequate fraud detection and deterrence methods. This review cannot be relied upon to 
provide assurances that fraud does not or will not exist within the company. Rather, it is 
designed to highlight weaknesses, if any, in the existing system. A potential review by XYZ 
would also provide management with recommendations for a proactive fraud deterrence 
program. 
 
The fee for these services will be $______ plus ex penses, which include, but are not limited 
to, travel, telephone, photocopying, and facsimile charges. One half of the fee is due upon 
signing this letter and the other half upon delivery of the report. All expenses will be billed at 
the conclusion of each month and are due upon receipt. Any invoice remaining outstanding 
for more than 30 days will be subject to a rebilling charge. 
 
Please review this proposal. If this proposal  meets with your approval, please sign and return 
one copy along with your check for $ ______ in the enclosed envelope. If you have any 
questions, please do not hesitate to call. Thank you.

be uncovered as a result of our examination. 
 
The fee for this examination will be $ ______ per hour plus expenses, which include, but are

RE: [Fraud Detection and Deterrence Review] 
 
Dear Mr./Ms. [                   ]: 
 
Pursuant to your request, XYZ & Associates (XYZ) has performed a review of the policies 
and procedures of the ABC Company (the Company) for the purpose of reviewing their 
adequacy to detect and deter fraud. 
 
This review does not provide assurance that fraud does not or will not exist. Having 
completed the following steps, we have determined that in order to strengthen its fraud 
detection potential, the Company’s procedures need improvement in the areas outlined 
herein. 
 
Part of the purpose of an internal control system is to assure that the assets of the Company 
are properly safeguarded from employee or outsider misapplication. In addition, an adequate 
system of internal control contains detection methods so that if misappropriation takes 
place, the irregularity will come to the attention of those who can remedy the situation and 
take suitable action against it. An adequate system of internal control is not designed to 
prevent or detect a collusive fraud scheme among employees and/or management. Our 
review included some the following procedures: 
 
[In this section, brie fly describe the main procedures follo wed. For example]: 
 
a. We read the Company’s policy and procedural manual. 
b. Through interviews with personnel key to the operations at the Company, we 
determined if the existing policies and procedures were being followed. 
c. We charted the current flow of business transactions as they are being recorded at the 
Company. 
d. We compared the flow of transaction approval and recording with the policies and 
procedural manuals.

The following discrepancies were noted in ABC’s system of internal control: 
 
[In this section, explain briefly the differences between the established internal 
controls and those procedures followed by the company’s personnel.] 
 
Based on our review, we recommend the following changes be instituted in the Company’s 
internal accounting controls system: 
 
[In this section, make your recommendations.] 
 
In addition to the above recommendations, we suggest the Company consider the following 
proactive approach to fraud deterrence: 
 
[In this section suggest proactive steps such as: ] 
 
 An internal audit structure reporting to the board of directors 
 Active inquiry of fraudulent transactions 
 Hotlines 
 Annual conflict of interest statements  
 Annual review of employee expense accounts, etc. 
 
This report is not intended for general circulation or publication, nor is it to be reproduced 
for any purpose other than that outlined above. XYZ does not assume any responsibility or 
liability for losses occasioned to one or others as a result of the circulation, publication, 
reproduction, or use of our report contrary to the conditions of this paragraph. The validity 
of our report is predicated on the extent to which full, honest, and complete disclosure was 
made by all parties. 
 
We will be in contact soon to discuss the details of this report. In the meantime, please feel 
free to call with questions.
