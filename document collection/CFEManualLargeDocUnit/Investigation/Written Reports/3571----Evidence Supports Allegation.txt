We have conducted a fraud examination concerning a possible [misappropriation of assets]

routine audit of the company’s books by  the company’s internal auditors]. 
 
Our fraud examination was conducted in accordance with lawful fraud examination 
techniques, which included [an examination of  books and records, voluntary interviews of 
appropriate witnesses/personnel, and other such evidence-gathering procedures as necessary 
under the circumstances]. 
 
Based on the results of our fraud examination, we find that there is sufficient evidence to 
support the conclusion that [assets in the am ount of $ _____ were misappropriated from the 
company’s bank account and that Mr./Ms. ______ appropriated these assets for his/her 
personal benefit].  
 
Please call me to set up a meeting at your earliest convenience so we can present you with
