Voice 
In grammar, voice  indicates the relation of the subject to the action of the verb. When the 
verb is in the active voice, the subject acts; when it is in the passive voice, the subject is  
acted upon. 
 
EXAMPLE 
John Doe wrote  the report. (active) 
OR 
The report was written  by John Doe. (passive) 
 
Both of the sentences say the same thing, but each has a different emphasis. In the first 
sentence, emphasis is on the subject, John Doe, whereas in the second sentence, the focus is 
on the object, the report. Notice how much stronger and more forceful the active sentence is. 
Always use the active voice unless there is good reason to use the passive. Because they are 
wordy and indirect, passive sentences are harder for the reader to understand. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Instances of fraud are most likely to be reported  by coworkers. (passive) 
OR 
Coworkers report  most instances of fraud. (active)
