Juries 
When the case reaches trial, the jury will usually receive the entire report for review and 
analysis. Juries normally do not have a back ground in business and accounting matters, 
therefore, the report should be as simple and easy to understand as possible. Of all the important 
individuals who will review the report, the members of the jury will by far be the most 
important.
