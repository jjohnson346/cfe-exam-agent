Visual Aids 
Occasionally, the fraud examiner might include visual aids prepared either as part of the 
report or to be used as exhibits at trial. Visual aids should be kept simple. Several different 
types of visual aids are discussed below. 
 
Link-Network Diagrams 
Link networks show the relationships between people, organizations, and events. Different 
symbols are used to represent different entities: a square can symbolize an organization; a 
circle, a person; a triangle, an event; and so fo rth. It doesn’t matter which symbols you use as 
long as you use them consistently. Confirmed connections between entities can be 
represented by a solid line or enclosure within another symbol. Speculative or presumed 
relationships can be indicated by broken lines. To achieve its intended purpose, a graphic 
should always be clear. Don’t cross lines if possible.  
 
EXAMPLE 
Smith is vice-president of the ABC Corporat ion and president of the DEF Corporation, a 
subsidiary of ABC. Jones is general partner in  the First and Second Partnerships. Brown and 
Green are limited partners in the First Partne rship. Brown and Black are limited partners in 
the Second Partnership. Black is also a general partner in the Third Partnership. Smith also 
might have an interest in  the First Partnership.

Matrices 
A matrix is a grid that shows the relationship (or points of contacts) between a number of 
entities. Known contacts can be differentiated from presumed contacts by means of a bullet 
(l) or a circle (m). 
 
A matrix can be used to identify the direction and frequency of telephone traffic between 
suspect parties.

Summaries of Witnesses’ Statements 
Reduce voluminous testimony and witness statements to summary form in order to identify 
inconsistent statements and to permit quick review. To identify pertinent passages, indicate 
briefly the topic being covered at a given point, and provide a synopsis of the statement (see 
example below).

Keep the synopsis as succinct as possible. Too much detail will impair the summary’s utility. 
The examiner or someone familiar with the facts and issues in the case should prepare the 
summary, not an assistant who does not know what might or might not be relevant. The 
summary can also be useful as a basis for a chronology. 
 
Reporting Standards  Investigation

An example of a report of a fraud examination is included in the Appendix to “Report 
Writing.” The fraud examiner typically will also  prepare other written documents including, 
but not limited to, engagement contracts and opinion letters.
