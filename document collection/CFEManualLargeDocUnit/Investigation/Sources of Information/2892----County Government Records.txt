County Court Records 
The great majority of an individual’s civil records can be found at the county courthouse in 
the jurisdiction where the subject does business or resides. 
 
Courts are generally divided into jurisdictions that encompass a single county in a single 
state. In each single court, there are usually three levels: trial courts, appellate courts, and 
supreme courts.  
 
Most of the papers filed in civil suits are acce ssible as public records; however, criminal and 
juvenile actions may not be as open to review. In addition, criminal conviction records are 
generally available to the public.  
 
A great deal of litigation occurs each year and many people might be subject to judicial 
action, voluntarily or not. Researching civil and criminal suits can provide invaluable 
information assisting in: 
• The location of individuals 
• Identifying pending actions 
• Uncovering closed cases 
• Insight into marital status (family) 
• Tracing sources of funds (probate) 
• Identifying financial conditions (bankruptcy) 
• Litigation history 
• Outstanding judgments 
 
Although a wealth of information is available in court files, civil or criminal actions might 
not be readily known and the researcher must be able to identify the jurisdiction, county, or 
court involved.  
 
A researcher typically will have access to microfiche listings of cases or parties within the 
individual court system through the clerk’s office. Some courts are set up to provide 
computerized access to this information. Normally, one must be able to provide a case 
number in order to access the actual court file. The Party Name Index will provide the  
case number. 
 
Investigation  Sources of Information 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.415 
Court clerks maintain files on all active and closed lawsuits in their jurisdictions. Information 
regarding these suits is public record and can be searched by scanning the indexes for 
subject’s name as a plaintiff or defendant. 
 
For example, the subject data fields of court records will contain: 
• The complaint for or against the subject (direct and reverse indexes) 
• The subject’s last known address (either through the lawsuit’s pleadings or the court 
officer’s citation and subpoena returns) 
• Other personal information on the subject, depending on the type of suit 
 
Court levels vary by jurisdiction, as do the names of the levels. Different case types are filed 
at different levels and in different courts.  
 
Different levels of courts are assigned jurisdiction over any given case, based on court issues 
and the nature of the claim. To determine the full extent of the litigation history against a 
company or individual, the examiner must search each of the various types of local court 
records. 
 
Civil Court Records 
The key to locating civil court records is knowing the correct spelling of your subject’s name, 
where the person currently lives, and where he lived in the past.  
 
Depending on the type of suit, civil court records will provide potentially valuable 
information. 
 
PERSONAL INJURY SUIT RECORDS 
Records for a personal injury suit, for example, will often contain an accident report, injury 
history, statements of the involved parties, and the financial settlement of the case.  
 
FINANCIAL SUIT RECORDS 
Financial suit records will disclose an individual’s debtors and creditors, and they will present 
an outside view of a business’s history or ability to perform. 
 
DIVORCE RECORDS 
Divorce record searches will return marriage partner names, addresses, location of marriage, 
divorce filing date, and file number. In addition, divorce records frequently contain the 
Sources of Information  Investigation 
3.416   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
subject’s financial inventory, which is submitted at  the time of the divorce or separation, and 
should also include the partition of assets to each party in the settlement. 
 
Criminal Court Records 
When conducting a criminal records search, certain types of information are critical. Like 
civil courts, criminal courts across the country are divided into jurisdictions that generally 
encompass a single county in a single state. 
 
Although most states have their criminal courts divided by county, some states offer indexes 
with criminal convictions for the entire state.  
 
Criminal convictions should not be confused with criminal filings. When you search for 
criminal records at the county level, you will find all cases filed by the district attorney, even 
if the person was not found guilty of a crime. When searching a statewide convictions 
database, you will find only cases that resulted in conviction.  
The county criminal court clerk maintains criminal court files that might contain a wealth of 
information. These files might provide information describing the offenses and the counts. 
These files also might contain the complainant’s signature (exemplar); a transcript of the 
preliminary hearing; the names of the prosecuting and defense attorneys; the probation 
officer’s report, with a background investigation of the defendant; and the subpoenas issued 
in the case. 
 
Probate Court Records 
Probate court records are documents filed to show the dispersal of assets after a subject’s 
death. The probate court conducts an investigation to verify any debts owed by an individual 
estate and sees to the dispersal of assets according to the deceased’s will (or if there is no 
will, by state law) after all debts are paid. 
 
The debts left in an individual’s estate will give the investigator information on the following: 
• Names of individuals with an interest in the deceased’s estate 
• The subject’s financial position at the time of death 
 
The dispersal of assets will reveal: 
• The names and addresses of heirs to the deceased 
• Some indication of the value of the property willed to them 
Investigation  Sources of Information 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.417 
County Coroner’s Register 
A county coroner’s register generally contains the name or a description of the deceased; 
date of inquest, if any; property found on the de ceased and its disposition; and the cause  
of death. 
 
County Personnel Department Records 
A county personnel department maintains information similar to that maintained by a city 
personnel department. 
 
Building Permit Records 
If a business or individual constructs a new building or makes improvements to an existing 
building, there should be a building permit on file with the local building authority. In 
addition, before most businesses can open their doors, the city or county may require that 
they possess certain permits. The local fire department may require permits ensuring that the 
business complies with the fire code. The city health department will require permits for 
restaurants or other businesses that serve food. Planning and zoning departments enforce 
regulations regarding the types of businesses and their locations.  
 
Public Schools 
County public school systems maintain information similar to that found in city public 
school systems. 
 
Voter Registration Records 
To be eligible to vote, U.S. citizens must be registered in their respective precincts. To 
register, citizens must fill out a registration application. The information required to process 
the application includes: name, address, date of birth, signature, and Social Security number. 
 
Voter registration records routinely are verified  by the county and old addresses are deleted 
as new ones appear. 
 
County Recorder’s Office Records 
A county recorder is a government office responsible for maintaining public records and 
documents, especially records relating to real estate ownership. A county recorder’s office 
maintains the following information: 
Sources of Information  Investigation 
3.418   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• Documents pertaining to real estate transactions — including deeds, grants, transfers and 
mortgages of real estate, releases of mortgages, powers of attorney, and leases that have 
been acknowledged or approved 
• Mortgages on personal property 
• Marriage license records and applications, including information on previous marriages, 
maiden names, addresses, and dates of birth 
• Wills admitted to probate 
• Official bonds 
• Notices of mechanic’s liens 
• Transcripts of judgments that are made liens on real estate 
• Notices of attachment on real estate 
• Papers in connection with bankruptcy 
• Certified copies of decrees and judgments of courts of record 
• Other documents permitted by law to be recorded, such as the Department of Defense’s 
DOD 214 Forms, recorded by some veterans as  evidence of veteran status, particularly 
in those states where veterans are granted reduced property tax rates 
 
Real estate transaction records are extremely important. They are relatively easy to access and 
contain a vast amount of information. Real estate records usually are found in the county in 
which the land is located. When an individual purchases real estate, he becomes a taxpayer 
and a registrant in the following county records:  real property records, property tax records, 
and tax assessor records. 
 
Real Property Records 
Each real estate transaction will list a deed verifying the transfer of the property. If an 
individual either buys or sells a house or piece of property, or his real property becomes 
subject to a state or federal lien, the transaction will be reflected in the county real property 
indexes. If improvements are made to the property, such as the addition of a new room or 
the installation of a pool, then a mechanic’s lien or other notice may be on file in the county 
property records. 
 
COMMERCIAL SEARCHES  
Many companies provide access to real property records. A search for a business or 
individual in these databases can return real property ownership information, recent property 
sales and transfers, refinance, construction loans, and seller carry-back transactions.  
 
Investigation  Sources of Information 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.419 
In addition, you can conduct a single search of all available online states in the same amount 
of time and for the same price as an individual county or state search. Typical responses will 
include the property owner’s name, property address, mailing address, parcel number, lot 
size, land, property value, tax amount, purchase amount, property description, and more. On 
refinance, construction loans, and seller carry-back and sale transactions, the date and 
amount of each transaction usually appear. This is especially useful for determining an 
individual’s equity in a specific property or for identifying individuals that may be receiving 
monthly income as a result of providing financing. 
 
NON-COMMERCIAL SEARCHES 
Although examiners can use commercial services to obtain real property information (e.g., 
identify the ownership of a piece of real property), some jurisdictions are not available, 
depending on how local jurisdictions and states compile property information. Searches may 
be conducted by business or person name(s), address, or name of the putative owner. 
Searches of the real property records may reveal: 
• Residences and addresses of buyer and seller (referred to respectively as grantor and 
grantee) 
• Price of the property (see tax stamps if listed) 
• Mortgage company and amount originally financed 
• Real estate ownership 
• Who financed the transaction, if applicable 
• Title companies involved 
• Improvements to the property, along with the names and addresses of the contractors 
used 
 
Property Tax Records 
In addition to the property records themselves, counties charge new landowners property 
taxes for upkeep of their schools, courthouses, police, and other public buildings. These 
records can provide: 
• An idea of the estimated value, for tax purposes, of the property listed 
• The identity of the owner of a vacant piece of land or a piece of property, if ownership is 
unknown 
• The name of the last person to pay taxes on the property 
 
When searching real property and tax records, the fraud examiner should always look for any 
additional names listed on the documents. Frequently, the name of the attorney or notary 
Sources of Information  Investigation 
3.420   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
public who verified the documents is listed, providing another potential source of further 
information. 
 
Tax Assessor/Collector Records 
County tax assessor’s and collector’s offices maintain information similar to that held by city 
tax assessor’s offices. 
 
Sheriff/County Prosecutor Records 
The county sheriff or the county prosecutor may maintain general incident files related to 
the businesses within the county. Incident files can provide leads on managers or owners of 
the business or third parties who have made complaints against the business. 
 
County Fire Marshal Records 
The county fire marshal should have a record of any fires that have occurred at specific 
properties. These records may contain information about a property’s insurer, as well as 
information about any previously conducted investigations. 
 
Regulatory Agency Records 
County regulatory agencies maintain information similar to that held by city regulatory 
agencies.  
 
Welfare Commission Records 
Files of a county welfare commission are based on information gathered by social workers, 
psychologists, and physicians. Frequently, the recipient of benefits provides the information, 
which is generally not verified. Files contain such information as the recipient’s address, 
previous employment, how much the recipient earned, property the recipient or the 
recipient’s relatives might own, the state of the family’s health, and criminal records.
