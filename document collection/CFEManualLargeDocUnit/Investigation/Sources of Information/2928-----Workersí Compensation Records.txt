Workers’ Compensation Records 
Records of workers’ compensation claims are av ailable in most states; however, the breadth 
of coverage will vary from state to state. Some states require some type of authorization 
from the target of the search. Workers’ comp ensation searches may return the subject’s 
name, Social Security number, date of birth, employer’s name, date and type of accident, and 
nature and extent of inquiry.  
 
The Americans with Disability Act, however, purports to prevent prospective employers 
from using workers’ compensation records to deny employment to otherwise qualified job 
applicants.
