Real Property Records 
Each real estate transaction will list a deed verifying the transfer of the property. If an 
individual either buys or sells a house or piece of property, or his real property becomes 
subject to a state or federal lien, the transaction will be reflected in the county real property 
indexes. If improvements are made to the property, such as the addition of a new room or 
the installation of a pool, then a mechanic’s lien or other notice may be on file in the county 
property records. 
 
COMMERCIAL SEARCHES  
Many companies provide access to real property records. A search for a business or 
individual in these databases can return real property ownership information, recent property 
sales and transfers, refinance, construction loans, and seller carry-back transactions.

In addition, you can conduct a single search of all available online states in the same amount 
of time and for the same price as an individual county or state search. Typical responses will 
include the property owner’s name, property address, mailing address, parcel number, lot 
size, land, property value, tax amount, purchase amount, property description, and more. On 
refinance, construction loans, and seller carry-back and sale transactions, the date and 
amount of each transaction usually appear. This is especially useful for determining an 
individual’s equity in a specific property or for identifying individuals that may be receiving 
monthly income as a result of providing financing. 
 
NON-COMMERCIAL SEARCHES 
Although examiners can use commercial services to obtain real property information (e.g., 
identify the ownership of a piece of real property), some jurisdictions are not available, 
depending on how local jurisdictions and states compile property information. Searches may 
be conducted by business or person name(s), address, or name of the putative owner. 
Searches of the real property records may reveal: 
• Residences and addresses of buyer and seller (referred to respectively as grantor and 
grantee) 
• Price of the property (see tax stamps if listed) 
• Mortgage company and amount originally financed 
• Real estate ownership 
• Who financed the transaction, if applicable 
• Title companies involved 
• Improvements to the property, along with the names and addresses of the contractors 
used
