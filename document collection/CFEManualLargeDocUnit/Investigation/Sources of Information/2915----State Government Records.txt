State Government Records 
The following items are basic types of public records that can be accessed at the state level 
of government: 
• Business flings 
• State court records 
• Uniform Commercial Code filings 
• Employee/labor department records 
Investigation  Sources of Information 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.421 
• State tax filings 
• Professional associations and licensing boards 
• State attorneys general records 
• Workers’ compensation records 
• Department of motor vehicles records 
• Bureau of vital statistics 
• Other state regulatory agencies 
 
Business Filings 
If an individual wants to conduct business in a name other than his own, the law requires 
that he file documents to claim ownership of that name. These documents can include: 
• Articles of incorporation 
• Foreign corporation registration 
• DBA/fictitious name registration 
• Tax related filings 
 
Articles of Incorporation 
Corporations are formed by filing articles of incorporation with the secretary of state (or 
state corporation bureau or corporate registry office) in the state of which the company does 
business. These corporate records are public record and will include: 
• Corporate name 
• Ownership information 
• Stock value 
• Initial shareholders 
• Names of the directors and officers 
• Registered agent 
• Location of the principal office 
• Date of incorporation 
• Standing/status 
 
This information will permit the investigator to review a corporate structure, identify the 
registered agent, and trace incorporation dates. The records will often include limited 
partnership information as well. The examiner can also use these records to verify the 
state(s) in which a company is registered as a corporation.

3.422   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Foreign Corporation Registration Records 
Some states, but not all, require foreign corporations (i.e., corporations that were 
incorporated in another state) to register with the state corporation office if the foreign 
corporation transacts business in that state. For example, if a corporation chartered in 
Delaware wishes to transact business in Texas, it must file an Application for Certificate of 
Authority. The application is filed with the secretary of state and must include the date of 
incorporation, the principal office, the address of the registered agent, and the names of the 
officers and directors. 
 
Fictitious Business Names/Doing Business As Information 
Doing business as (DBA) information is typically filed at the county level, though many 
states require filing with at the state level as well. Most states also require limited 
partnerships, trusts, and joint ventures to file DBA information at the state or county level. 
This information will provide insight into the true business venture behind the name. DBA 
information is very similar to corporate filings with the secretary of state, and they allow 
examiners to trace the corporation’s roots or  prove ownership in sole proprietorships, 
partnerships, limited partnerships, joint ventures, and trusts. 
 
Tax Related Filings 
Some state revenue departments require certain businesses to obtain licenses or permits, 
such as a sales tax permit. The licenses and the applications are generally public record. If the 
business is delinquent in the payment of its taxes, the local or state tax investigator or 
collector might be able to provide inside information concerning the business. 
 
Law enforcement officials might be able to gain access to corporate, business, and personal 
state tax information. These records might unwittingly reveal hidden assets or investments. 
Loans to or from officers, stockholders, or related entities should be examined closely. Also, 
mortgages, notes, and bonds shown as liabilities on a corporate return should be 
investigated. Tax returns might also disclose the identity of the accountant or attorney 
preparing the return.  
 
State Court Records 
State Civil Court Records 
State civil court records searches are conducted by court, by county, and are divided between 
upper and lower courts (generally a monetary division) where applicable. Searches of state 
civil court records may return the identities of the plaintiff and defendant, case number, 
Investigation  Sources of Information 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.423 
filing date, cause of action, and disposition or current status. Depending on the court, 
divorces, domestic, family law, child support, name changes, or probate matters may also be 
included.  
 
State Criminal Court Records 
State criminal court records searches are conducted by court or by county for felonies, 
misdemeanors, or a combination of both. Searches of state civil court records may return the 
identity of the defendant, a physical description of the conduct, the arrest date, arresting 
agency, case number, filing date, charges, and disposition or current status. An index search 
is available for some states and counties, and most states have some type of release 
requirement for obtaining this information.  
 
Uniform Commercial Code Filings 
A search of Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) filings can help you identify personal 
property that an individual or business has financed. This is because a lender must file UCC 
statements with the secretary of state or with the county level unit to perfect its security 
interest in personal property. 
 
Banks, finance companies, and other lenders will generate records or recorded filings of 
financial transactions conducted with individuals and businesses, such as purchases of 
household furniture, appliances, boats and yachts, automobiles, aircraft, and business 
equipment. 
 
These filings produced as the result of the transactions will identify: 
• Name of the debtor or joint debtors 
• Current address of the debtors 
• Name of the financial lender 
• Type of collateral pledged as security 
• Date of filing and continuations 
 
UCC filings can also disclose when and where a person obtains personal loans, the type of 
property pledged to the lender to secure the loan, and the current address of the debtor. 
These documents provide itemized lists of personal property held by the debtor. 
 
Additionally, UCC filings and supporting documents can help examiners uncover hidden 
ownership or relationships between parties by viewing the names of all listed debtors and 
Sources of Information  Investigation 
3.424   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
their addresses. The examiner may find information linking individuals to the companies 
they own, or discover information about a company’s subsidiaries, branch offices, or parent 
company.  
 
These documents can be readily retrieved from the secretary of state’s office, through service 
companies, or through online public records services. One company that provides access to 
this information is Experian. Experian’s UCC online database provides information from 
state-level UCC-1 financing statements, as well as information on amendments, assignments, 
terminations, and so on. Most online responses will include debtor and secured party 
name(s) and address(es), file date and file number for each original filing, amendment dates, 
and assignment information (when applicable). 
 
Employee/Labor Department Records 
Some states, under their labor departments, require the filing of periodic lists of employees, 
revealing their names, Social Security numbers, and salaries. In addition, by examining 
previous filings, an investigator can locate former employees.  
 
Professional Associations and Licensing Boards 
Many state and local agencies or bodies main tain records identifying individuals holding 
special licenses or memberships. These can include: 
• Medical practitioners, such as doctors, dentists, and nurses 
• Social workers 
• Attorneys 
• Certified Public Accountants 
• Real estate licensees 
• Notaries 
• Law enforcement personnel 
• Firefighters 
• Security guards 
• Stockbrokers 
• Teachers 
• Insurance agents 
• Private investigators 
• Bail bond agents 
• Travel agents 
• Barbers and cosmetologists 
Investigation  Sources of Information 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.425 
• Contractors, engineers, electricians, and architects 
 
The licenses and applications granted by the state might be public record. Although some 
applications contain no more than a name and address, other applications contain lengthy 
personal information, such as previous residential addresses, previous employers, education 
and training, and financial statements. Some agencies are required to conduct a background 
investigation before issuance of a license. 
 
Also, the state regulatory or licensing agency might have the authority to suspend or revoke 
the licenses necessary for the business to operate. 
 
Many professional organizations maintain their own listings of members or licensees. They 
might be reluctant to provide information beyond the person’s name and current standing in 
the association. 
 
State Attorneys General Records  
State attorneys general are good sources of information on whether a particular entity or 
individual was the subject of an enforcement action by a particular state. For links to the 
attorney general’s website for any of the 50 states, consult the National Association of 
Attorneys General at http://www.naag.org. 
 
Workers’ Compensation Records 
Records of workers’ compensation claims are av ailable in most states; however, the breadth 
of coverage will vary from state to state. Some states require some type of authorization 
from the target of the search. Workers’ comp ensation searches may return the subject’s 
name, Social Security number, date of birth, employer’s name, date and type of accident, and 
nature and extent of inquiry.  
 
The Americans with Disability Act, however, purports to prevent prospective employers 
from using workers’ compensation records to deny employment to otherwise qualified job 
applicants. 
 
Department of Motor Vehicles Records 
The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) maintains information on drivers’ licenses, 
vehicle registrations, titling, car dealers, car salespeople, wrecking yards, tow companies, 
smog inspection facilities, and (in some states) auto repair businesses.  
Sources of Information  Investigation 
3.426   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
DMV records were once thought to  be good locator tools, but recent restrictions on the use 
of such data has reduced the effectiveness of such searches. Moreover, the update quality of 
individual state records supplied by state authorities may not be adequate to locating people 
in a transient, fast-paced society. Still, searches such as Driver Identification can be useful on 
a spot basis. 
 
Vehicle ownership information will identify ve hicles registered to a specific person or 
business. These records include trailers, motor homes, or motor vessels. Information on 
disability placards may also be available. Current ownership of a particular vehicle can be 
obtained through the use of a plate number or a vehicle identification number (VIN). 
Information returned will include plate number, VIN, expiration date, make, model, model 
year, registered owner’s name/address, and legal owner’s name/address.  
 
In 1999, Congress made significant changes to the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994 
(18, U.S.C., § 2721). The amended law bars sta tes from releasing drivers’ Social Security 
numbers, photographs, or certain other information unless they obtain “the express 
consent” of each person in advance. Before the 1999 amendments, drivers could “opt out” 
and ask that their information not be released. Under the new law, however, drivers are 
under an “opt in” system that requires their express authorization of the release of 
information. Although the law was challenged, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the 
constitutionality of the new amendments in January 2000. 
 
These amendments make it extremely difficult to obtain almost any up-to-date information 
from state motor vehicle departments. Such information can only be obtained if the driver 
has expressly consented to its release. Therefore, companies may wish to consider having 
employees sign a consent form as early as the employment application stage because even 
though the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act does not prohibit the use of motor vehicle 
records for pre-employment screening, the state can only release the records with the 
driver’s consent.  
 
Bureau of Vital Statistics 
A state’s bureau of vital statistics, where birth certificates are generally filed, is an excellent 
source of information. Birth certificates can provide a child’s name, sex, date of birth, and 
place of birth; the names of the attending phy sician, midwife, and/or other assistants; the 
parents’ names, ages, addresses, races, places of birth, and occupations; the mother’s maiden 
Investigation  Sources of Information 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.427 
name; and the number of siblings. (In some states, birth certificates might be found at the 
city or county level.)  
 
Other State Regulatory Agencies 
At the state level, the following additional records can be found: 
• Auto licenses, auto transfers, and sales of vehicles 
• Civil service applications 
• Drivers’ licenses 
• Health department records 
• Inheritance and gift tax returns 
• Name changes 
• Occupancy and business licenses 
• Parole officers’ and probation departments’ files 
• Personal property tax returns 
• School and voter registrations 
• State income tax returns 
• Welfare agency records 
 
The following state departments and agencies might also maintain information valuable to 
fraud examiners: 
• Bureau of Professional and Vocational Standards or Department of Licensing (especially 
professional associations, partnerships, and corporations) 
• Controller/treasurer 
• Department of Agriculture 
• Department of Industrial Relations 
• Department of Natural Resources 
• Horse-Racing Board/Gambling Commission 
• Secretary of State (corporations division) 
• State Board of Equalization 
• State Police or Highway Patrol 
• State Securities Commission 
• State Utility Commission
