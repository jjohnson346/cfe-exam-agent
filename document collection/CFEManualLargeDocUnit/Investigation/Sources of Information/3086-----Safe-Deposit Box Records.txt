Safe-Deposit Box Records 
Valuable information can be obtained from a safe-deposit box record. These records usually 
provide the name(s) of the person(s) renting the box, how often a person visited it, the dates 
he visited it, and the times he visited it. The times and frequency of visits can be valuable if 
they correspond to times and dates of deposits or withdrawals from other accounts.  
 
The contents of a safe-deposit box, however, are not known by bank officials, and they are 
never recorded on the box holder’s file. More over, banks usually require the customer’s 
consent, a search warrant, or a court order before an authorized bank official can open a safe 
deposit box.
