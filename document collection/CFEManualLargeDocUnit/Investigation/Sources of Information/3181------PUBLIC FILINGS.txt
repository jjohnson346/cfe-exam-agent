PUBLIC FILINGS 
In the United States, public companies, nonprofits, and some private companies must 
submit financial filings and forms to different government entities. Public companies, for 
example, submit various filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (e.g., the annual 
report and the 10-K). These public filings provide a wealth of information about the filing 
company, including the nature of its business, its history, its organizational structure, its 
auditor, its balance sheets, and its income statements. Similarly, public filings are available for 
nonprofits, which must file the Form 990 to the Internal Revenue Service.
