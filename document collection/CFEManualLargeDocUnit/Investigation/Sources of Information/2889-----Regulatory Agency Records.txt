Regulatory Agency Records 
Applications for business licenses, contained in the files of city regulatory agencies, often 
have valuable information on certain types of enterprises. In many cities, the following 
businesses would have to apply for licenses to operate: 
• Businesses seeking liquor licenses 
• Professionals, including certified public accountants, dentists, doctors, plumbers, 
electricians, and optometrists 
• Restaurants, bars, and night clubs (which are frequently inspected by health and fire 
departments) 
• Businesses operating under names other than the owners’ names (such businesses must 
register under assumed names and are included in the city’s DBA [doing business as] 
files)
