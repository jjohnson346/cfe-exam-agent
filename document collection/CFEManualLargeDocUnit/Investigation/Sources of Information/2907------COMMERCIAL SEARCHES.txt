COMMERCIAL SEARCHES  
Many companies provide access to real property records. A search for a business or 
individual in these databases can return real property ownership information, recent property 
sales and transfers, refinance, construction loans, and seller carry-back transactions.

In addition, you can conduct a single search of all available online states in the same amount 
of time and for the same price as an individual county or state search. Typical responses will 
include the property owner’s name, property address, mailing address, parcel number, lot 
size, land, property value, tax amount, purchase amount, property description, and more. On 
refinance, construction loans, and seller carry-back and sale transactions, the date and 
amount of each transaction usually appear. This is especially useful for determining an 
individual’s equity in a specific property or for identifying individuals that may be receiving 
monthly income as a result of providing financing.
