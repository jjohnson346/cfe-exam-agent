Services (USCIS) is a bureau of the Department of Homeland Security. The USCIS is 
charged with overseeing lawful immigration in the United States, and it retains a number of 
records, including alien registration records issued after August 27, 1940 (from July 1, 1920, 
to August 27, 1940, each immigrant was given an Immigrant’s Identification Card); lists of 
passengers and crews on vessels from foreign ports; passenger manifests and declarations 
(ship, date, and point of entry); naturalization records (names of witnesses to naturalization 
proceedings and acquaintances of the individual); deportation proceedings; and financial 
statements of aliens and people sponsoring an immigrant entry.
