Obtaining Financial Information and Locating Assets 
Discovering whether assets exist, where they exist, and whether they are recoverable can be 
accomplished with a search of federal, state, local, and proprietary records. These records 
can be further divided into those identifying “hard” assets and those regarding the potential 
for assets, credit capacity, or credit worthiness. 
 
SEARCHES FOR HARD ASSETS 
• The ownership of real property may be discoverable through the use of property 
searches, to the extent that they are available at the local or county level within individual 
states. 
• The ownership of vehicles can be inferred through the use of the DMV Vehicle Name 
Index, to the extent that the records within the controlling state agency reflect vehicles 
registered to a specific person or organization at a particular address. Conversely, the 
ownership of a particular vehicle may be inferred from the DMV vehicle registration 
searches. 
• An assumed business name search may be helpful in identifying a sole proprietorship 
business in which attachable assets are available.  
• The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is extraordinary in that it can be useful in a wide 
variety of business situations. A search of UCC filings can help identify personal 
property that an individual or business has financed. UCC filings can also disclose when 
and where a debtor obtained personal loans, the type of property that he pledged to the 
lender to secure the loan, and the debtor’s current address 
• The ownership of an aircraft can be determined by searching the Aircraft Ownership 
Database by business name, person name, or wing number.

SEARCHES FOR ASSET POTENTIAL 
• The question of whether it is realistically possible to recover known assets may be 
partially answered by searching bankruptcy filings, tax liens, and tax judgments. 
• Again, the versatility of a UCC filings search is seen through the identification of assets 
that may have been pledged, in whole or in part, to secure a loan. For example, in a case 
where a bank lender has secured a loan through some type of chattel as collateral and has 
sought to perfect its lien on the chattel through a UCC filing at the state level, it can be 
fairly assumed that the debtor has a bank account with the secured party. Thus, a bank 
account asset may be identified as a recoverable asset.   
• Consumer credit reports and business credit reports searches may help develop a clearer 
picture of the target’s potential for asset recovery in terms of credit capacity and 
creditworthiness. Although access to consumer credit reports is restricted by the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), business credit reports are not governed by the FCRA. 
Business credit reports often contain information that is useful in verifying information, 
understanding business relationships, and developing basic financial information about 
an organization.
