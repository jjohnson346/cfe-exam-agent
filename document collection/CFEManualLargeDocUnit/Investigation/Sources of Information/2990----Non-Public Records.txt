Non-Public Records 
 
Types of Non-Public Records 
As previously stated, non-public records—information about a person or business that is 
considered to be private and confidential—mig ht be needed in some fraud examinations. 
Some of the most valuable personal records include: 
• Banking records 
• Tax returns and related documents 
• Credit records 
• Telephone records 
• Credit card account records 
 
Banking Records 
Bank records are perhaps the single most important external financial source available to a 
fraud examiner. In addition to their use as evidence for fraud, banking records might provide 
leads on sources of funds, expenditures and personal affairs. These records help the 
examiner construct a paper trail to prove the fraud.  
 
Some of the records that should be reviewed, if available, are: 
• Account opening documentation 
• Monthly account statements 
• Checks written on the account 
• Loan files 
• Safe deposit box records 
• Currency transaction reports 
• Bank collection department records 
• Mortgage loan files

Tax Returns and Related Documents 
Personal tax returns, if available, may provide indirect evidence of illicit payments, such as 
profits or losses from previously undisclosed business ventures, or interest and dividends on 
hidden certificates of deposit and bank accounts. The returns may also show deductions and 
expenses, such as real estate taxes, which may lead to previously unknown funds or assets. 
 
Credit Records 
Practically all lines of business have specialized credit-reporting associations that can provide 
credit information on individuals and businesses, including trade information, designation of 
lenders and creditors, types of businesses, date accounts were opened, terms of payment 
agreed upon, highest credit, balance owing, and paying habits. Some credit reports also give 
the name of the bank the subject does business with and the size of the subject’s accounts.  
 
In the United States, most consumer credit information is collected and maintained by the 
three national credit-reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Generally, a 
subscription is required to obtain information from these sources, and their dissemination is 
governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The FCRA places restrictions on when a 
consumer credit report can be obtained and used. In many cases, the consumer must be 
notified or must consent to the use of the report for employment purposes. Please consult 
the information on the FCRA presented previously in this chapter for more information 
about the legality of obtaining and using consumer credit reports.  
 
Credit reports are provided by credit reporting agencies, also known as credit bureaus. Credit 
reporting agencies are local or national institutions that collect data from various sources on 
individual consumer creditworthiness and report that data to their members or subscribers.  
 
There are essentially two types of credit reporting agencies. The first is known as a file-based 
credit reporting agency, which develops its information from credit files and public records. The 
other type is known as an investigative credit reporting agency, which gathers most of its 
information through interviews.  
 
Credit reporting agencies typically maintain the following information: 
• Consumer information, such as address, age, family members, employers, income levels, 
length of employment, the extent of other obligations, and the like 
• Account information, such as payment schedules, items purchased, defaults (if any), and 
buying habits 
Investigation  Sources of Information 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.451 
• Marketing information, such as customers brok en down by age, sex, income levels, and 
other classifications 
• Information on current and former employers 
 
Information on the creditworthiness of a business organization may also be obtained from 
credit reporting agencies. The responses for such searches may include payment trends from 
creditors, public records (such as UCC filings and tax liens), banking information, and key 
facts as to the type of business and ownership. But unlike consumer credit information, 
business credit information is not restricted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
 
Generally, credit reporting agencies obtain their information from the following sources: 
• Consumers, primarily from filling out application forms for credit. 
• Public records, which provide information on bankruptcies, court judgments, 
foreclosures, divorces, criminal convictions, registered chattel mortgages, and registered 
agreements.  
• The major credit grantors and collection agencies, which, as subscribers, regularly send 
their credit files electronically to the credit bureaus, resulting in files that include the 
account number, outstanding balance, and a nine-point scale indicating whether a 
payment was made on time.  
• Many credit grantors and collection agencies  only report payment information to one of 
the three national credit-reporting agencies, but larger creditors may report to more than 
one bureau. Some creditors, like utility companies, only report delinquent activity. Since 
the big three agencies do not share data among themselves, there will be differences 
between the credit reports from each credit bureau. 
 
In a typical credit information request, the potential creditor calls the credit bureau (or 
makes an online request) for information, and the creditor receives details regarding other 
credit histories of the individual, such as payment schedules and delinquencies.  
 
Information maintained by credit reporting agencies is regularly updated at the request of the 
consumer or by request of the credit grantor.  
 
Telephone Records 
Like other types of non-public information, telephone records can provide valuable insight 
into fraud examinations. For example, telephone records  may provide contacts with real 
Sources of Information  Investigation 
3.452   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
estate brokers or sellers, identify charge calls from vacation spots or contacts with co-
 conspirators, or provide other leads to assets and expenditures. 
 
Credit Card Account Records 
Credit card account records can be helpful when conducting a fraud examination. Credit 
card receipts will track the travels of the defendant, and, of course, record expenditures. An 
extremely high balance on a credit card may indicate a motive for the crime or provide 
circumstantial evidence of hidden income. Even modest credit card charges may provide 
leads to identifying hidden assets (e.g., charges for boating supplies purchased at a marina 
might indicate a need for further investigation to determine whether the subject owns an 
expensive boat). 
 
Gaining Access to Non-Public Records 
Non-public records are not available to the public and therefore, may be difficult to obtain. 
Despite the limitations on obtaining personal records, fraud examiner may be able to obtain 
non-public records by using one or more of the methods discussed below.  
 
Requesting the Records 
The simplest way to obtain relevant documents is to request them. This usually works for 
examiners representing large organizations that are important customers to the party with 
the information. Vendors and other customers of the company conducting the investigation 
may cooperate voluntarily if they have nothing to hide (or think that incriminating evidence 
cannot be found) and are anxious to maintain good relations with the company. 
 
Subpoenas 
Subpoenas and other legal processes, such as depositions, interrogations, and document 
requests, are available if a civil action is filed. For example, a wronged organization may file a 
civil or administrative action or make a criminal referral so that records can be subpoenaed. 
In a civil case, records such as bank accounts, brokerage accounts, travel, credit card, credit 
agencies, and telephone toll records may be obtained by subpoena. 
 
Conversely, records subpoenaed in a criminal case usually are available only to the 
government during the investigation and perhaps thereafter if not disclosed at trial. In 
addition, law enforcement agencies may also subpoena records, of course, but usually will 
not disclose them to the victim or third parties. 
 
Investigation  Sources of Information 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.453 
Demand as a Condition of Continued Business 
Similarly, an organization may demand that a supplier, vendor, or agent turn over relevant 
documents as a condition of continued business. Taking this action is legal, in appropriate 
circumstances. Of course, management and counsel should be consulted before such 
demands are made, particularly if the other party has a contractual relationship with the 
company. 
 
Exercise Audit Clause Rights 
An audit clause allows the parties to access the books of the other party. Thus, absent 
subpoena power, examiners may need to use audit clause rights to access contractor and 
subcontractor records and financial accounts.  
 
Unfortunately, most audit clauses are too narrow to provide useful information. However, if 
properly constructed, an audit clause can be a powerful method by which on-book 
information can be obtained. 
 
Negotiating 
Another method to obtain relevant documents is to negotiate with a party to the 
investigation as part of a deal to cooperate in exchange for leniency. In some cases, third-
 party facilitators, or others marginally involved in the wrongdoing, may agree to produce 
records and cooperate in exchange for a release of liability, indemnity, or commitment to 
continue the business relationship. Counsel and management must, of course, be involved in 
such decisions, as well as the fidelity bond carrier, if a claim is to be made under the bond. 
 
Consent  
Although unlikely, a target executive may voluntarily produce certain records (if he is 
blameless, thinks he is blameless, or thinks the investigators will not find the “smoking 
gun”), or execute a consent to obtain such records from banks, credit agencies, or the IRS.
