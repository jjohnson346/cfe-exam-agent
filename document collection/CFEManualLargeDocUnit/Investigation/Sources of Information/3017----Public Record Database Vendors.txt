Public Record Database Vendors 
 
Types of Public Record Database Vendors 
Although there are many categories of public record professionals, this section focuses on 
three: commercial database vendors, search firms, and document retrievers.  
 
Commercial Database Vendors 
Commercial database vendors provide users access to very powerful archives of data that 
compile various public records in one searchable database. Unlike public databases, 
commercial databases generally contain a broad range of information and allow the user to 
search millions of records simultaneously. Because these databases contain diverse types of 
information, fraud examiners can use them for many different types of jobs. 
 
Although generally, commercial database vendors do not provide any more information than 
can be accessed from other sources, they have two distinct advantages—search speed and 
constant access. 
 
Generally, commercial database vendors are available online and allow users to retrieve 
requested information through a computer that is connected to the Internet. For such 
databases, there may be an initial access fee, monthly membership fees, or a one-time access 
fee. 
 
Search Firms 
Search firms specialize in locating assets and retrieving public documents. They use a variety 
of resources, including online services, databases, public records, private information 
sources, and private investigators.  
 
Document Retrievers 
Document retrievers are researches for hire; they obtain information by visiting government 
agencies in person.

vendors, such as criminal and civil litigation, bankruptcies, management or sales 
information

the subject is living beyond his or her means, or has financial problems, through real 
property, motor vehicle, UCC and other records of assets and expenditures
