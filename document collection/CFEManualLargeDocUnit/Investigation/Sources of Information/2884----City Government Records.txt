Health and Fire Department Records 
Most local health or fire departments conduct routine inspections of businesses for health 
and safety code or fire code violations. These inspectors might have valuable information 
about the business, its operations, the employees, and the owners. 
 
Death certificates usually can be found at city, county, or state health departments. A death 
certificate provides the name of the deceased, address, sex, age, race, birthplace, birth date, 
death place, date and time of death, Social Security number, medical certificate, and 
coroner’s certificate. Additionally, a death certi ficate generally provides information about 
the deceased’s parents and their occupations. 
 
City Personnel Department Records 
The city personnel department maintains personal-history statements from city employees 
and political leaders, as well as employment records, efficiency reports, and records of salary 
liens on city employees. 
 
Public School Records 
City school systems maintain teachers’ bi ographies, showing personal background, 
education, and former employment; and stud ent records, showing biographies (in some 
school districts), grades, and disciplinary actions. 
 
Regulatory Agency Records 
Applications for business licenses, contained in the files of city regulatory agencies, often 
have valuable information on certain types of enterprises. In many cities, the following 
businesses would have to apply for licenses to operate: 
• Businesses seeking liquor licenses 
• Professionals, including certified public accountants, dentists, doctors, plumbers, 
electricians, and optometrists 
• Restaurants, bars, and night clubs (which are frequently inspected by health and fire 
departments) 
• Businesses operating under names other than the owners’ names (such businesses must 
register under assumed names and are included in the city’s DBA [doing business as] 
files)

City Tax Assessor/Collector Records 
A city’s tax assessor’s office maintains maps of real property in the city, including a 
property’s dimensions, address, owner, taxable value, and improvements. A tax collector’s 
office maintains the following information: 
• Names and addresses of payers of property taxes, even if the taxes were paid by 
individuals other than the apparent owners 
• Legal descriptions of property 
• Amounts of taxes paid on real and personal property 
• Delinquency status of taxes 
• Names of former property owners 
 
Utility Company Records 
Many utility companies are nonprofit corporations or municipalities. Although the recent 
trend has been to restrict access to utility company records, check with the utility companies 
in the subject’s area to see what, if any, information is available. Utility records might contain 
the phone number of the customer, even if that number is unlisted. In addition, be sure to 
check the names of friends or relatives.
