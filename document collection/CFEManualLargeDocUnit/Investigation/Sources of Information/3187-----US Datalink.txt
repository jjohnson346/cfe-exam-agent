US Datalink 
US Datalink is an employee background check service. Although it cannot retrieve 
information as quickly as some other vendors, US Datalink is the only company that relies 
entirely on manual searches for its information. US Datalink exclusively sends its researchers 
to the county courthouse to look up the requested information, as opposed to the electronic 
and possibly faulty information that other online investigative databases use. Therefore, if a 
fraud examiner has the time to wait for his inquiry, US Datalink might be the most reliable 
option. US Datalink also has media resources, and it can be found at www.usdatalink.com.
