Laws Governing Access to Information 
Despite the public’s broad right of access to public records, there are numerous laws that 
limit access to certain types of information, and a number of risks to privacy are raised by 
the collection of information. Therefore, fraud examiners must be certain that any 
information obtained is done so legally. 
 
Freedom of Information Act 
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is the primary Act that governs the availability of 
governmental records to the general public. The Act sets very specific guidelines regarding 
what governmental records are and are not open to the public. The records that are available 
are known as “public records,” raw records of information that are compiled and maintained 
by governmental agencies. The various records are maintained at one of the three 
governmental levels: federal, state, or county/ local. Although the FOIA is a federal Act, 
most states have adopted very similar versions of the FOIA to cover the state and local 
jurisdictions. While these versions are similar to the original FOIA, the individually passed 
state acts may differ slightly in specific legal areas from state to state.  
 
Sources of Information  Investigation 
3.404   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
The FOIA and its individual state counterparts regulate:  
• The type of records that a governmental agency may maintain about a person 
• The conditions under which such information may be disclosed to another governmental 
agency 
• The circumstances and methods under which an individual may obtain copies of agency 
records that pertain to him 
 
Generally speaking, governmental records about an individual are prohibited from release. 
The disclosure of these records constitutes an invasion of privacy. A person may obtain 
copies of his own records by requesting them in writing from the agency that maintains 
them. Such requests often are denied, in whole or in part, because of numerous exceptions 
to the disclosure requirements. Some of these exceptions include the pendency of an 
ongoing investigation or concerns about national security. A person denied access to records 
may appeal through that agency or through the courts.  
 
Most records are maintained at the county or local level, a fact that can seriously hamper any 
fraud investigation; it can be very difficult for the fraud examiner to catch up with a 
fraudster who understands the county filing procedures and chooses to operate in different 
counties. However, the following records are available at different levels of government. 
 
The FOIA provides for public access to the following information: 
•  Tax rolls 
•  Voter registration 
•  Assumed names  
•  Real property records 
•  Divorce/probate suits 
 
Information NOT deemed to be public under the FOIA includes: 
•  Banking records 
•  Trust records 
•  Telephone records 
•  Passenger lists 
•  Stock ownership

Fair Credit Reporting Act 
One of the primary statutes limiting access to  information is the federal Fair Credit 
Reporting Act (FCRA). This statute regulates the dissemination of consumer information to 
third parties by consumer reporting agencies. Historically, the FCRA only applied to 
consumer credit reports, but due to amendments in 1997, the FCRA now applies to the 
gathering of many other types of information about an individual through third parties. 
 
The FCRA applies in the employment context when an employer contracts with a consumer 
reporting agency (CRA) to collect consumer reports on employees or potential employees. A 
CRA is defined as anyone who sells information about people (e.g., a private investigator or 
an online public records service). A consumer report  is defined as any written, oral, or other 
communication by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a customer’s credit worthiness, 
credit standing, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living. 
 
The FCRA, however, does not apply if the person or organization seeking the information 
gathers it directly from the source.  
 
If the FCRA does apply, it generally means that an examiner cannot use a third party to 
obtain certain information about a person unless that person has received certain notices and 
signed a consent form. The failure to do so can mean civil penalties. 
 
Complying with the FCRA 
Before an employer can obtain consumer information about a current or prospective 
employee from a third party, it must comply with all of the following requirements: 
• Provide the individual with a “clear and conspicuous” separate written disclosure that 
the employer might obtain a report 
• Obtain the individual’s written authorization 
• Inform the third party that the employer has complied with the FCRA’s notice 
requirements 
• Inform the third party that the employer will not use the information to violate any equal 
employment law 
 
The disclosure and the authorization can be contained in the same document, as long as the 
document contains nothing else. 
 
Sources of Information  Investigation 
3.406   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
If the employer relies on a consumer report for an “adverse action” (e.g., denying a job 
application, reassigning or terminating an employee, or denying a promotion), then it must 
provide the individual with a pre-adverse action disclosure before taking the adverse action. 
This disclosure must include a copy of the individual’s consumer report and a copy of “A 
Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act,” which is available from  
the FTC. 
 
After adverse action is taken, the employer must notify the individual via an adverse action 
notice that the action has been taken. That notice must include the following: 
• Name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting agency (CRA) that 
supplied the report; 
• A statement that the CRA did not make the adverse action decision and cannot explain 
why the adverse action was taken; and 
• A notice of the individual’s right to di spute the accuracy or completeness of the 
information furnished, and his right to an additional free consumer report from the 
agency upon request within 60 days. 
 
If, however, the employer is gathering the consumer information in connection with a 
workplace investigation of misconduct, however, it may be excluded from the FCRA (see 
the section “Workplace Investigations of Fraud and Misconduct” below). 
 
Workplace Investigations of Fraud and Misconduct 
The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 amended the Fair Credit Reporting 
Act (FCRA) to exempt certain reports involving employee misconduct investigations. 
 
As a result of these amendments, an employer who uses a third party to conduct a workplace 
investigation no longer has to obtain the prior consent of an employee if the investigation 
involves suspected misconduct, violation of laws or regulations, or violation of any 
preexisting policy of the employer. 
 
To qualify for this exception, the report from the third party must not be communicated to 
anyone other than the employer, an agent of the employer, or the government. 
 
But if “adverse action” is taken against the employee based on the results of the 
investigation, the FCRA still requires the employer to provide the employee with a summary 
of the report. “Adverse action” is broadly defined as any employment decision that adversely 
Investigation  Sources of Information 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.407 
affects the employee. The summary must “contain the nature and substance of the 
communication upon which the adverse action is based.” It does not, however, have to 
identify the individuals interviewed or the sources of the information. 
 
Investigative Consumer Report 
Under the FCRA, an investigative consumer report is a report containing information about 
an individual’s character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living, that 
is obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, or associates. If such a 
report is made, then other notices and consents may need to be obtained from the 
individual. For example, a separate disclosure must be used to inform the employee that an 
investigative consumer report is being obtained. The form must also state what sort of 
information will be collected. 
 
Also, the company must disclose to the individual the nature and scope of the investigation 
(if he requests). If any adverse action is to be taken against the person, he can ask to receive 
a copy of the report before such action is taken. Further, the report given to the individual 
must not be redacted, meaning that if the report contains names of the people providing the 
information and what they reported, such information cannot be deleted from the report. 
The person must also be given an opportunity to dispute the findings in the report. 
 
Contact Your Attorney 
Unfortunately for fraud examiners, the FCRA has created several more hoops that 
examiners must jump through before they can obtain certain types of information. The 
FCRA is not clearly written, but the Federal Trade Commission has published several letters 
giving its interpretation of the statute. These letters and the text of the FCRA can be 
obtained through its website at www.ftc.gov.  
 
The most important thing for the fraud examiner to remember is to consult his in-house or 
outside counsel. Your attorney will help you determine what procedures you need to 
institute to comply with the FCRA. 
 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB) was passed in 1999, and rules implementing the Act 
became final in 2001. GLB was originally enac ted to allow banks and other companies to 
offer previously forbidden services, such as insurance and securities brokerage services. 
Congress was worried that these “super banks” would share customers’ financial data with 
Sources of Information  Investigation 
3.408   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
affiliates and other companies to hawk their products. Therefore, Congress added a 
provision requiring “financial intuitions” to te ll customers about their privacy policies, to 
notify customers of private information they intend to share, and to give customers the 
chance to block such information sharing. 
 
To implement the law, Congress ordered regulators to define “financial institution” in the 
broadest possible terms. Thus, “financial institutions” include not just banks, but also 
insurance companies, accountants, tax preparation and real estate settlement services, and 
investment advisors. The text of the rule can be found at 16 C.F.R. Part 313. Additional 
information about the rule can be found at the Federal Trade Commission’s website: 
www.ftc.gov. 
 
GLB is important for fraud examiners because the privacy rules implemented as part of the 
Act have been interpreted to prevent the selling of credit header information, and under the 
FTC’s interpretation of the rule, credit header information cannot be sold except for the 
very limited purposes allowed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The agency reached this 
decision by concluding that such basic personal information, such as names and addresses, is 
financial information, and, therefore, must be protected under the GLB Act. Therefore, the 
GLB prevents credit bureaus from selling credit header information (including names, 
addresses, phone numbers, and Social Security numbers) to private investigators, direct 
marketers, or other information brokers. 
 
As a general rule, financial information can be obtained only by subpoena.  
 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also made it a criminal offense to engage in “pretexting.” 
Some individuals used pretexting as a means to gather financial information about a subject. 
Pretexters would contact a financial institution and pretend to be the customer or someone 
else authorized to obtain financial information and basically trick the financial institution 
into providing information about the subject. 
 
Section 6821 of Title 15 of the U.S. Code (added by GLB) makes it an offense to: 
• Use false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or documents to get customer information 
from a financial institution or directly from a customer of a financial institution;  
• Use forged, counterfeit, lost, or stolen documents to get customer information from a 
financial institution or directly from a customer of a financial institution; or 
Investigation  Sources of Information 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.409 
• Ask another person to get someone else’s custom er information using false, fictitious, or 
fraudulent statements or documents or using forged, counterfeit, lost, or stolen 
documents.  
 
Violators can, under certain circumstances, be fined and/or imprisoned up to 10 years. 
 
Pretexting is not always illegal, but it should be used with extreme caution. For example, if a 
fraud examiner is trying to locate a witness or a suspect, he might call the person’s relative 
and pretend to be an old high school friend who is looking for a phone number. This type of 
pretexting generally is not illegal. However, it is illegal to obtain certain types of information, 
such as financial records and phone records. 
 
Fraud examiners should never impersonate a member of law enforcement, and should never 
impersonate an actual person (particularly the individual being investigated). To do so may 
lead to charges of identity theft. In 2006, investigators hired by Hewlett-Packard were 
charged with identity theft, conspiracy, and wire fraud for acquiring the phone records of 
several members of their board of directors who were suspected of leaking confidential 
information. As a result, Congress passed the Telephone Records and Privacy Protection 
Act, which is codified at 18, U.S. Code, section 1039. This law makes it a federal crime to 
obtain confidential phone records without authorization, including posing as another 
individual.  
 
Before engaging in any type of pretexting activity, investigators should consult with an 
attorney to determine whether the information sought is protected by state or federal law as 
well as whether the planned impersonation method is legally acceptable. 
 
Privacy Act of 1974 
The Privacy Act of 1974 restricts information about individuals, including employees and 
non-employees, that might be gathered by governmental agencies. Under the Act, an agency 
may maintain records about a person containing information that is relevant and necessary 
to accomplish a purpose of the agency. This information may include a person’s education, 
finances, medical history, criminal history, employment history, and identifying information 
(fingerprint, voice print, or photograph). The person may have access to his information 
unless it is investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, statistical records, 
or material compiled solely for determining suitability, eligibility, or qualification for federal 
service or promotion.  
Sources of Information  Investigation 
3.410   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Right to Financial Privacy Act 
The Right to Financial Privacy Act prohibits financial institutions from disclosing financial 
information about individual customers to governmental agencies without the customer’s 
consent, a court order, a subpoena, a search warrant, or other formal demand. There are, 
however, limited exceptions to this rule. 
 
Although the statute applies only to demands by governmental agencies, most banks and 
other financial institutions also will not release such information to private parties absent 
legal process, such as a subpoena issued in a civil lawsuit. 
 
Driver’s Privacy Protection Act  
In 1999, Congress made significant changes to the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994 
(18, U.S.C., § 2721). The law bars states from  releasing drivers’ Social Security numbers, 
photographs, or certain other information unless they obtain “the express consent” of each 
person in advance. Before the 1999 amendments, drivers could “opt out” and ask that their 
information not be released. Under the law, however, drivers are under an “opt in” system 
that requires their express authorization of the release of information. Although the law was 
challenged, the U.S. Supreme Court, in January 2000, upheld the constitutionality of the 
amendments. 
 
These amendments make it extremely difficult to obtain up-to-date information from state 
motor vehicle departments. Such information can only be obtained if the driver has 
expressly consented to its release. Therefore, companies may wish to consider having 
employees sign a consent form as early as the employment application stage. For example, 
the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act does not prohibit the use of motor vehicle records 
(MVR) for pre-employment screening, but the state can only release the records with the 
driver’s consent.  
 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) instituted several 
additional privacy rules concerning personal health information. While most of the rules do 
not directly affect fraud investigations, fraud examiners should be aware of the rules because 
they may have an impact on the type of information that can be legally gathered on 
employees. 
 
Investigation  Sources of Information 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.411 
The HIPAA privacy rules place restrictions on the availability and use of “protected health 
information.” The definition of this term is extremely broad and covers any information 
relating to an individual’s past, present, or  future physical or mental health, payment for 
services, or health care operations. 
 
If information about the health of an individual or payments for services becomes an issue 
during an investigation, fraud examiners should immediately contact the human resources 
(HR) department. The HR department should have information about whether the entity is 
subject to HIPAA rules and can assist you in compliance with those rules.  
 
The most important thing to note is that if HIPAA rules do apply, you are restricted as to 
the type of health information you can access without specific written authorization. You 
should never contact the health care provider, the health-plan administrator, or a medical-
 billing service for copies of employee’s records without first consulting the employer’s legal 
counsel or the HR department.
