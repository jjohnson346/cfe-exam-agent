State Criminal Court Records 
State criminal court records searches are conducted by court or by county for felonies, 
misdemeanors, or a combination of both. Searches of state civil court records may return the 
identity of the defendant, a physical description of the conduct, the arrest date, arresting 
agency, case number, filing date, charges, and disposition or current status. An index search 
is available for some states and counties, and most states have some type of release 
requirement for obtaining this information.
