The Whois Protocol 
Whois is a query response protocol that is used to search databases that store domain 
registration records, including domain name, server addresses, technical contacts, and 
addresses. These databases can be queried at the following sites: 
• Networksolutions.com will provide the ownership and registration information for a 
website.  
• Arin.net is a whois server that searches for the registrant and IP address range of a 
particular IP address.  
• Allwhois.com will find the whois database for a particular domain name.  
• Whatismyipaddress.com provides a collection of tools for locating information about an 
IP address.   
• Traceroute.org—like whatismyipaddress.com— can be used to trace IP addresses.
