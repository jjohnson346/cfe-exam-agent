Negotiated Checks 
Canceled checks written by a subject or received from others provide the fraud examiner 
with much more than amounts, payees, and endorsees. Of particular interest are checks that 
have been cashed. All banks use a series of codes or symbols imprinted on the front of a 
check to show that the check has been cashed. The specific codes used in various areas can 
be obtained locally. 
 
A useful technique to help examine negotiated checks is to list the information from the 
checks on a spreadsheet (either manual or electronic). Checks should be listed by number 
and date on the left with the payee, amount, and purpose of the check, if known, to the 
right. This will show the subject’s routine monthly or annual expenditures that can be useful 
for computing the comparative net worth. The absence of a check for a recurring payment 
for a particular month might indicate a cash payment, which in turn would indicate possible 
undisclosed cash income. Examine the backs of checks payable to cash and note where they 
were cashed. The depository stamp can identify the bank at which the check was cashed. 
This information may provide a lead to another bank account.

CHECK 21 
“With image exchange, and the emerging fraud detection technology, banks will be able to 
know if sufficient funds are in the account … whether the customer is who he claims to be 
… and whether the check is legitimate.” 6 
 
In July 2003, Congress issued final regulations regarding the availability of funds and 
collection of checks. These regulations, known as “Check 21,” created “substitute checks,” a 
type of negotiable instrument that became the legal equivalent of paper checks. This 
provision facilitates the efficient collection and return of checks in electronic form by 
alleviating the collection requirement that depository banks actually send the original paper 
checks to collecting banks for payment.  
 
Under Check 21, a depository bank can transfer check information electronically to a 
collecting bank via a substitute check for presentment. The collecting bank is then required 
to take presentment of the substitute check as long as it meets all the legal requirements of 
the original check. Therefore, rather than actually processing and sending an original  
paper check across cities and states, the depositing bank can now collect the substitute  
check electronically. 
 
A substitute check is a paper reproduction of the original check that states, “This is a legal 
copy of your check. You can use it the same  way you would use the original check.” Upon 
transfer, presentment, or return, a bank warrants that the substitute check submitted is an 
accurate depiction of the physical check, and that no depository bank, drawee, drawer, or 
endorser will be asked or required to pay a check that has already been paid. Essentially, this 
legend on the substitute check informs consumers of their rights to expedited recrediting of 
an amount charged if there is a disputed item and the original or substituted copy is 
necessary to prove the validity of the charge on the account. Under this law, the validity of a 
charge becomes an issue when a consumer is charged twice for a check, the substitute check 
is illegible, or the original check was not properly copied during the imaging process. 
 
Furthermore, Check 21 places the risk of loss associated with substitute checks on the 
reconverting bank that first transferred, presented, or returned the substitute check.

Although the reconverting banks can allocate such loss among themselves, they may remain 
liable under warranty claim, indemnity, or recrediting claims. 
 
TRACING CHECKS 
Tracing checks is facilitated by the use of bank identification symbols. Fraud examiners do 
not have to understand the internal bookkeeping procedures used by banks. The concept of 
bank identification symbols, however, is of interest. All checks printed for banking 
institutions contain an ABA transit number. These numbers represent an identification code 
developed by the American Bankers Association. The ABA transit number enables a check 
to be routed to the bank of origin. In the process of routing, a trail is left. 
 
MAGNETIC INK CHARACTER RECOGNITION 
Magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) is a machine language and is a check design 
standard to which all banks must conform. Numeric information is printed in magnetic ink 
on the bottom of bank checks and other documents. This coding is electronically scanned by 
computers that convert the magnetic ink notations into electronic impulses readable by a 
computer. MICR information is printed in groupings called fields. The first field on the left 
on bank checks is the Federal Reserve check routing code and the next is the ABA transit 
number. These numbers also appear in the upper right corner of the check. 
 
The account number field shows the drawer’s assigned account number at the bank. When 
the check is processed through the bank, an additional field is added on the right for the 
amount of the check. The dollar amount of the check should always equal the encoded 
MICR amount. These two figures should be compared to make sure that the subject did not 
alter the returned check. All checks, drafts, and similar items that are not encoded with 
magnetic ink cannot be cleared through the Federal Reserve system without special handling. 
 
PREFIX NUMBERS OF CITIES IN NUMERICAL ORDER 
When the ABA established the city and state prefix numbering system, it did so by the 
geographical location of the reserve cities in existence at the time. The prefix numbers 
identify city and state documents. For example, numbers 1 through 49, as seen in the 
following examples, were given to the most populated reserve cities and major banking 
centers at the time. The rest of the numbers, 50 through 99, were assigned to the states from 
East to West. The principal numbers 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 were given to the main collecting 
financial centers (New York, Pennsylvania, Illi nois, Missouri and California). The numbers 
before and after each principal number were generally designated to nearby states.

All banks in an area served by a Federal Reserve bank or branch carry the routing symbol of 
the Federal Reserve bank or branch. The Federal Reserve routing symbol (FRRS) 
encompasses the first four digits of the nine-digit routing number. This routing symbol 
identifies where the Federal Reserve bank is located. The first two numbers of the FRRS 
designate the Federal Reserve District in which the bank is located (as shown below). The 12 
Federal Reserve Districts and numbers are as follows:  
 
01—Boston, MA 
02—New York, NY 
03—Philadelphia, PA 
04—Cleveland, OH 
05—Richmond, VA 
06—Atlanta, GA 
07—Chicago, IL 
08—St. Louis, MO 
09—Minneapolis, MN 
10—Kansas City, KS 
11—Dallas, TX 
12—San Francisco, CA 
 
The next two numbers designate the specific bank location of the Federal Reserve branch. A 
thrift institution is designated when “2” is added to the first digit of the FRRS. For example, 
if there is a thrift institution in the first district (Boston) the designation would be “21.” If 
the thrift institution is in a district that has a double digit, such as San Francisco, the 
designation becomes “32.” The next four numbers of the routing number sequence are

number is a digit derived from an algorithmic calculation.
