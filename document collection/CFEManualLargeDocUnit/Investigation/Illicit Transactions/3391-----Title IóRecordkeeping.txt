Title I—Recordkeeping 
The regulations governing recordkeeping are set forth in Chapter 31 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations at Part 103, Subpart C. The recordkeeping requirements are set forth for banks, 
nonbank financial institutions, securities brokers, casinos, and currency dealers and 
exchangers. Under these regulations, all institutions are required to keep a record of any 
financial transaction of more than $10,000. 
 
These regulations provide, in part, that banks must keep an original, microfilm, or other 
copy or reproduction of most demand deposits (checking account) and savings account 
records must be retained for five years. The records must include signature cards; 
statements, ledger cards or other records disclosing all transactions, that is, deposits and 
withdrawals; and copies of customers’ check s, bank drafts, money orders, and cashier’s 
checks drawn on the bank or issued and payable by it.

In addition, banks also must retain, for two years, all records necessary to reconstruct a 
customer’s checking account. These records must include copies of customers’ deposit 
tickets. They must also retain records necessary to trace and supply a description of a check 
deposited to a customer’s checking account. 
 
Although some of these requirements apply to checks written or deposits made in excess of 
$100, most banks find it cheaper to microfilm all pertinent records, including the checks and 
deposits in amounts less than $100, rather than sort their records into two categories. The 
Bank Secrecy Act also requires financial institutions to retain a record of any extension of 
credit of more than $10,000 as well as each tr ansfer of $10,000 or more outside the United 
States.
