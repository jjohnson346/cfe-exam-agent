Net-Worth Analysis 
Any recipient of funds, whether honest or suspect, has only four ways of disposing of 
income: save it, buy assets, pay off debts, or spend it. 
 
Net-worth analysis begins with the completion of a suspect’s financial profile. Through 
identification of the suspect’s assets, liabilities, income, and expenses, a net-worth statement 
can be determined. Once a net-worth statement is completed through the identification of a 
suspect’s assets, liabilities, income, and expenses, changes in the suspect’s net worth can be 
compared to his known income, and differences can be inferred to be from unknown 
sources. 
 
COMPARATIVE NET WORTH: ASSET METHOD  
Again, the asset method is advisable when it is suspected that the subject has purchased 
assets or otherwise increased his net worth. It can be applied for any number of years, but, 
ideally, it is best to start with the year before the suspected fraudulent activity began. The 
formula is: 
 
 Assets 
– Liabilities 
= Net worth 
– Prior year’s net worth 
= Net worth increase 
+ Living expenses 
= Income (or expenditures) 
– Funds from known sources 
= Funds from unknown sources 
 
In computing the comparative net worth, these issues should be considered: 
• All assets should be valued at cost, not fair market value. Subsequent appreciation or 
depreciation of assets is ignored. 
• The amount of funds available to the subject from legitimate sources should be 
estimated or computed generously. The amount of the subject’s expenditures, 
Tracing Illicit Transactions  Investigation 
3.840   2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
particularly hard-to-document living costs, such as food and entertainment, should be 
estimated conservatively to give the subject the benefit of any doubt. In attempting to 
estimate personal living expenses, you should consult the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
This agency publishes an annual table that details personal living expenses such as 
utilities, food, and gas. 
• Always attempt to interview the subject to identify all alleged sources of funds and to 
negate defenses that he might raise later. 
 
To compute the comparative net worth using the asset method, perform the following steps: 
• Establish the starting point, generally the year before the target’s illegal activities begin. 
This will be referred to as “year one” in the following computations. 
• Compute the target’s net worth at the end of year one. Identify all assets held by the 
subject, valued at cost, including assets acquired earlier, and the amount of current 
liabilities. 
 
The difference between the value of the assets and the liabilities is the target’s net worth at 
year one, or “opening net worth.” 
 
EXAMPLE 
Year One 
Assets at Cost               Liabilities 
Residence $100,000  Mort gage balance $ 90,000 
Stocks and bonds 30,000  Automobile loan  
Automobile 20,000  balance 10,000 
 TOTAL $150,000  TOTAL $100,000 
 
Assets $150,000
 Liabilities -100,000
 Net Worth $50,000
  
Compute the target’s net worth for year two, using the same method. 
 
  
Investigation  Tracing Illicit Transactions 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.841 
EXAMPLE 
Year Two 
                     Assets at Cost                                          Liabilities 
Residence $100,000  Mortgage balance $50,000 
Stocks and bonds 30,000    
Automobile 20,000  Automobile loan  
CD 50,000  balance  0  
 TOTAL $200,000  TOTAL $50,000  
 
Assets $200,000
 Liabilities -50,000
 Net Worth $150,000
  
Note that in the example the target’s net wo rth increased by $100,000 during year two. 
To determine the source of such an increase, determine the target’s known income, 
during year two, and subtract known expenses for year two. 
 
EXAMPLE 
Year Two 
               Income                            Expenses 
Salary $30,000  Mortgage interest 
payments 
 
$20,000 
Commissions 20,000  Living expenses 10,000  
 TOTAL $50,000  TOTAL $30,000 
   
The difference between the target’s income and expenses equals the increase (or decrease) in 
net worth from year one to year two, which can be attributed to known sources. Here it is 
$20,000. Subtract the increase in net worth fr om known sources from the total increase in 
net worth to determine the amount from unknown sources. 
 
EXAMPLE 
 Total increase in net worth $100,000 
 Increase attributed to known sources <20,000>  
 Dollars from unknown sources $80,000 
 
Repeat the above steps for subsequent years as necessary.

EXPENDITURES METHOD 
The expenditures method (also known as the sources and application of funds method) 
compares the suspect’s known expenditures and known sources of funds during a given 
period of time. Any excess expenditures must be the result of income from unknown 
sources. It is closely related to the net-worth analysis, accounting variations of the same 
principle. 
 
The table below illustrates the formula used to compute net worth using the expenditures 
method. The steps are discussed in greater detail below  
 
Expenditures  (Application of Funds)  
– Known source of funds  
= Funds from unknown sources  
 
To compute the subject’s net worth using the expenditures method, follow three steps. First, 
establish the subject’s known expenditures for the relevant year. Expenditures include the 
use or application of funds for any purpose, including deposits to bank accounts, purchase 
of major assets, travel and entertainment expenses, and payment of loan and credit card 
debts. Second, identify all sources of funds available to the subject, including loans and gifts, 
as well as cash on hand from previous years. Third, compute the difference between the 
amount of the suspect’s expenditures and his known income to determine the amount 
attributed to unknown sources.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    3.843 
EXAMPLE 
Subject   Year One  Year Two  
Application of funds:  
 Increase in bank balance  $2,000 $10,000 
 Down payment on residence    ——  10,000  
 Purchase of automobile  10,000  ——— 
 Mortgage payments  8,000  20,000 
 Credit card payments  5,000  10,000 
 Other expenses  15,000  30,000 
 TOTAL  $40,000 $ 80,000 
Less: known sources of funds  
   Cash on hand 1,000  
   Salary 30,000 38,000 
   Interest earned on savings  
   Account 1,000 2,000 
   Loan proceeds 8,000  
 TOTAL $40,000 $ 40,000 
Funds from unk nown or illegal sources   0 $40,000 
 
The following example demonstrates how a net-worth analysis assisted prosecutors in their 
amended complaint against a fraud suspect. 
 
EXAMPLE 
R. Peery, age 40, the executive director of a five-state commission planning a low-level 
radioactive waste dump was charged with two ne w charges of felony theft. Peery was also 
charged with one federal count of wire fraud. 
 
Peery was accused of wiring $115,000 to a personal account in Georgia, and prosecutors 
said they suspected him of taking $600,000. He was also charged with  two counts of using 
commission funds in Nebraska to buy cars, a 1990 BMW valued  at $67,000 and a 
1991 BMW valued at $92,000. 
 
Peery was paid $52,000 annually. He lived in a house valued at $305,000 and at the 
time of his arrest had six luxury cars, including Jaguars, Mercedes-Benzes, and BMWs.
