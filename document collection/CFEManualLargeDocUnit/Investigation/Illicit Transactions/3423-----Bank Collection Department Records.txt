Bank Collection Department Records 
The bank’s collection department, which is normally involved in collecting amounts due on 
installment contracts and notes, can be used to collect personal checks (usually in large 
amounts and with special instructions), thus circumventing the normal record-keeping 
associated with checking accounts. Such a transaction will not be reflected on the target’s 
regular checking account statements but will appear in the collection department records. A 
copy of the check also will be microfilmed.
