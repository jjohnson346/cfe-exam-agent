Savings Bond Purchases 
Drug dealers and tax evaders often use savings bond purchases as a means to conceal  
their ready cash. In several recent cases, defendants in financial crimes have purchased 
bonds in their individual names, their spouses’ names (in their maiden names), or their 
children’s names.
