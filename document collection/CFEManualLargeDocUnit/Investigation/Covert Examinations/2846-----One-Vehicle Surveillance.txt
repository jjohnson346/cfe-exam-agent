One-Vehicle Surveillance 
When one vehicle is used, it must remain close enough to allow the observers to monitor the 
subject’s actions, but far enough behind to avoid detection. When a subject’s car stops, one 
observer should follow his actions on foot. The subject normally will not expect to be tailed 
by a person on foot while he is using his car. When the subject turns a corner, the observers 
can make one of two possible moves. They can continue in the original direction, cross the 
intersecting street, and make a U-turn; the subject will take little interest in a car turning into 
the street behind him coming from the opposite direction. An alternative would be to 
continue in the original direction, cross the intersecting street, and continue around  
the block.
