Covert Informants 
A covert informant serves the same basic function that any other type of informant does by 
supplying information to authorities on criminal behavior. The difference in this category is 
that a covert informant is one who has been embedded in a situation or scenario for a 
number of years and is called upon only sporadically for tip-offs and leads. These types of 
informants are often referred to as moles, because of the nature of their insulated situation as 
inside sources. Weston and Wells identify two instances in which covert informants are 
commonly used: in organized crime and hate-extremist group investigations, covert 
informants are often culled to get information about upcoming criminal activities by  
the groups.
