Use of Operatives 
Operatives are subject to greater control than informants. In a typical scenario, a source or 
informant advises that information exists or that a crime is currently being committed. The 
informant’s motives might or might not be altruistic. For example, a warehouse worker 
approaches the fraud examiner and says that Collins is stealing inventory. The informant 
wants money for her assistance in apprehending Collins. The examiner does not know 
whether the informant is telling the truth or whether she is trying to divert attention from 
herself.  
 
The informant suggested that she secretly record a conversation with Collins, getting Collins 
to admit to the theft. If an informant conducts the investigation under the examiner’s 
direction, he then becomes an operative. To demonstrate a worst-case scenario, consider the 
following example. Without the examiner’s k nowledge or consent, the informant plants a 
tape recorder in the break room at the warehouse, and records conversations to which he is 
not a party. This is a violation of the law regarding interception of communication. Although 
the recording was made without the examiner’s knowledge or consent, the case is 
nonetheless compromised. The informant might insist that he recorded the conversations at 
the examiner’s request, thereby placing the examiner in the unenviable position of having to 
defend himself. 
 
Most operatives lack the training to conduct an investigation, and they cannot, in many 
instances, be trusted. It is vital that operatives be properly monitored and supervised. Obtain 
background information on the operative to ensure his degree of culpability in the offense, if 
any. Make certain that the operative clearly understands the objectives of the covert 
operation, and ensure that he is regularly debriefed before and after critical meetings with the 
target. Be careful that the operative does not take any action without proper authorization.

Satellite and Civil Liberties 
In the 1980s, the Supreme Court made several rulings that established the legal basis for 
satellite surveillance. Some of these key rulings are listed below. 
 
California v. Ciraolo, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 1810 (1986). The court ruled that aerial photographs did 
not interfere with a person’s expectation of privacy. 
 
United States v. Dunn, 55 U.S.L.W. 4251, 4253 (1987). The court held that open areas are not 
protected by Fourth Amendment rights. 
 
Dow Chemical Company v. United States, 106 S.Ct. 1819 (1986). The court enunciated standards 
regarding the legality of aerial photography. It expressed concern about satellite surveillance, 
but did not establish any legal distinction between aerial photography and satellite 
surveillance.
