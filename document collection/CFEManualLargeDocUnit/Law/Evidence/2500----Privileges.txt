Privileges 
 
Introduction 
There are certain evidentiary privileges that protect certain types of evidence from being 
discovered or produced. Invoking a privilege for a piece of testimony or other evidence in a 
legal encounter keeps the material outside trial proceedings. If a privilege applies, the court 
and its petitioners are denied access to the privileged information, and judges and juries must 
disregard any evidence they do actually hear if it is deemed privileged afterward.  
 
The most important privileges are discussed below. 
 
Attorney-Client Privilege 
The attorney-client privilege precludes disclosure of communications between an attorney 
and client, but only if the following conditions are met: 
• The client retained the attorney 
• To provide legal advice 
• And thereafter communicated with the attorney on a confidential basis, and 
• The privilege has not been waived 
 
The attorney-client privilege applies to individuals as well as corporations or other business 
entities. In the context of an investigation of a company, communications generally will be 
protected under the attorney-client privilege if the following elements are present: 
• The communications were made by corporate employees to counsel. 
• The communications were made at the direction of corporate superiors in order for the 
company to obtain legal advice from counsel. 
• The employees were aware that the communications were being made in order for the 
company to obtain legal advice. 
• The information needed was not available from upper management. 
• The communications concerned matters within the scope of the employees’ corporate 
duties. 
  
Basic Principles of Evidence  Law 
2.726  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• The communications were confidential when made and were kept confidential by the 
company. 
 
A general counsel’s participation in an investigation conducted by management does not 
automatically create an attorney-client privilege. The key element is that the attorney (whether 
in-house counsel or outside counsel) is conducting the investigation for the purpose of 
providing legal advice to the company. The privilege generally extends to information 
gathered by investigators if the investigator is acting at the direction of the attorney. 
 
The attorney-client privilege prevents disclosure of the communications—the letters, memos, 
or contents of telephone calls—b etween the attorney and client, not of the underlying facts 
or documentary evidence in the case. A client may not refuse to produce documents or other 
relevant evidence merely because such evidence was previously given to the attorney. 
 
Similarly, the attorney-client privilege does not prevent disclosure of communications that 
relate to business rather than legal advice. Corporate counsel is often consulted to give advice 
on matters related to business conduct rather than legal issues. Such communications would 
be discoverable. 
 
Finally, the attorney-client privilege may not be asserted if the communication involved the 
attempted or actual commission of a present crime or fraud. The attorney does not have to be 
a participant in the fraud for the waiver to apply. 
 
Waiver 
Special care should be taken to ensure that the attorney-client privilege is not waived 
inadvertently by giving documents or communicating information to anyone outside the 
investigation team, including members of law enforcement. If information gathered during an 
investigation is shared with law enforcement, then the privilege may be waived not only as to 
the information given, but also to any other information relating to the same subject matter.  
 
For example, if an investigator submits a copy of his report to the prosecutor who initiates 
criminal proceedings based on the findings in the report, the criminal defendant may be able 
to require the investigator to provide all the documents he used in writing the report. In such 
an instance, the investigator may be considered to have waived the privilege. Likewise, if law 
enforcement requests the results of an investigation or information gathered during an 
investigation, the attorney should be consulted before turning over the information. Some 
Law  Basic Principles of Evidence 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.727 
courts have held that the privilege is not waived if a company is subpoenaed to produce the 
information. 
 
Inadvertent Waiver 
Moreover, some courts have held that inadvertent disclosure of a single privileged document, 
including digital documents, waives the privilege as to all documents concerning the same 
subject matter. For this reason, special care must also be taken to avoid inadvertent disclosure 
from the use of electronic communications, including e-mail, cell phones, faxes, text 
messages, instant messages, etc. It is clear that the attorney-client privilege extends to 
electronic communications, and it is also clear that a matter voluntarily communicated to a 
third-party who is not an agent of your counsel is not confidential and, therefore, not 
privileged. Thus, when a party chooses to use a form of electronic communication, which is 
vulnerable to interception and inadvertent disclosure, you run the risk that your messages 
might be intercepted by, or disclosed to, an unintended third-party.  
 
To illustrate how easily inadvertent disclosure of electronic communications may occur, 
consider a few ways that an e-mail may unwittingly end up in the hands of an unintended 
third-party. E-mails may be forwarded to additional unintended employees, indicating a lack 
of confidential subject matter; they may be distributed to a large number of persons, 
suggesting a lack of confidentiality; or the sender could mistakenly hit the wrong key on the 
keyboard and send the e-mail to the wrong recipient. Therefore, fraud examiners must be 
concerned about the risks of inadvertent disclosure of electronic communications and should 
take cautionary measures to preserve the attorney-client privilege. 
 
Unfortunately, fear over the consequences of subject-matter waiver has led to dramatic 
litigation cost increases in today’s digital environment, where reviewing tens, hundreds, and 
even thousands of gigabytes of information for privilege is time consuming and expensive.  
 
Federal Rule of Evidence 502 
In an effort to protect against inadvertent waiver of the attorney-client privilege or the work 
product protection, President Bush signed into law S. 2450, a bill adding Evidence Rule 502 
to the Federal Rules of Evidence. The legislation resolves conflict between courts throughout 
the country on whether an inadvertent production of privileged material results in waiver. 
Simply stated, under Rule 502, an inadvertent disclosure of a privileged communication can 
no longer waive protection for all documents concerning the same subject matter. 
 
Basic Principles of Evidence  Law 
2.728  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Among other things, Rule 502 provides the following protections: 
• If disclosure is made, then the privilege is waived to any other undisclosed information 
only if (1) the waiver is intentional; (2) the other information relates to the same subject 
matter; and (3) “fairness” requires further disclosure (Rule 502(a)).  
• If disclosure is inadvertent, it does not result in waiver when the privilege holder “took 
reasonable steps to prevent disclosure” and “promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the 
error” (Rule 502(b)).  
• If the disclosure was made in a state court proceeding, the disclosure does not waive 
protection in a federal proceeding if one of two conditions is met: (1) the disclosure 
would not have been a waiver under Rule 502; or (2) the disclosure is not a waiver under 
state law (Rule 502(c)).  
 
The McNulty Memorandum and the DOJ Guidelines 
On December 12, 2006, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued guidelines (in the form of 
the McNulty Memorandum) for federal investigation and prosecution of business 
organizations. The McNulty Memorandum, which addressed the practice of federal 
prosecutors investigating and charging business organization misconduct, revised the DOJ’s 
prior guidance outlined in the much maligned Thompson Memorandum, which provided that 
federal prosecutors could seek waiver of the attorney-client privileges and attorney work 
product protections as an element of a company’s cooperation. Specifically, the McNulty 
Memorandum provided specific criteria that prosecutors were required to consider and 
procedures they were required to follow before seeking waiver of privileges or work product 
protection. 
 
On August 28, 2008, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued guidelines, which revised the 
McNulty Memorandum, on how federal prosecutors investigate, charge, and prosecute 
corporate crimes. Unlike the McNulty Memorandum, the guidelines are a part of the U.S. 
attorney’s manual, which provides internal DOJ guidance but does not create any enforceable 
law. 
 
In an effort to stop congressional action, such that proposed by S. 445, the guidelines bar 
prosecutors from judging corporate cooperation for leniency on whether an entity is willing 
to waive the attorney-client privilege or work product protection. The guidelines also state 
that prosecutors can no longer seek disclosure of information that is either privileged or 
protected work product. In addition, the guidelines provide that when evaluating a 
corporation’s cooperation, prosecutors may no longer consider whether a company is 
Law  Basic Principles of Evidence 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.729 
advancing legal fees for its employees, whether a corporation has sanctioned or retained 
culpable employees, or whether a corporation has entered into joint defense agreements.  
 
Even though most observers agree that the guidelines are a significant improvement over the 
McNulty Memorandum, many contend that comprehensive legislation is still needed to make 
the DOJ’s reforms permanent and prevent a relapse in department policy, as well as to bar 
similar waiver policies adopted by other federal agencies such as the Securities Exchange 
Commission and the Internal Revenue Service. For this reason, the DOJ’s guidelines may 
stop interested parties from supporting the enactment of legislation that would further 
protect corporations and their employees from government-coerced waiver. 
 
Selective Waiver 
Under the selective waiver doctrine, a corporation seeking to cooperate with a government 
investigation, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, can disclose material protected by the 
attorney-client privilege to the government without waiving those protections as to 
nongovernmental parties, such as private plaintiffs. But it should be noted that most federal 
circuit courts have rejected the selective waiver doctrine. In addition, Rule 502 of the Federal 
Rules of Evidence does not explicitly acknowledge selective waiver, but it does not explicitly 
eliminate selective waiver as a viable doctrine.  
 
The Attorney Work Product Doctrine 
Under Rule 26(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and under comparable state 
rules, documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation are 
protected by the attorney’s work product doctrine or privilege. The privilege is conditional in part: 
The opposing party may obtain access to otherwise privileged investigative documents and 
things through pre-trial discovery if it can show substantial need  for the protected information 
and that the information cannot be obtained from another source. However, the attorney’s 
mental impressions, opinions, and strategies concerning the litigation are absolutely privileged 
and cannot be discovered even with a showing of substantial need. The privilege extends to not 
only information and documents prepared by a party or the party’s attorneys, but also by the 
consultants and examiners hired by the attorneys. For instance, communications with the 
attorney and any work or analysis done by an expert with whom the attorney has consulted is 
privileged as work product, although that privilege will be waived if the expert is called to 
testify as an expert witness at trial.  
 
Work product protection applies only to documents and things prepared  in anticipation of 
Basic Principles of Evidence  Law 
2.730  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
litigation or for trial. Thus, documents and tangible things prepared in the course of an in-house 
or other pre-litigation investigation, even if at the direction of an attorney, may not be 
privileged if they were not prepared in anticipation of litigation. Just because there is a possibility 
of future litigation does not mean that the investigation is in anticipation thereof. Litigation 
must be actually planned and the work for which protection is sought must have been 
undertaken for the specific purpose of preparing for that litigation. But if the work to be 
protected was done in anticipation of litigation, then it does not matter in most jurisdictions that 
no lawsuit has been filed yet. 
 
The privilege protects documents and things prepared in anticipation of litigation from 
compelled disclosure. Nevertheless, it does not render the facts themselves confidential, 
privileged, or non-discoverable. Thus, while reports, interview notes, and transcripts might 
not be discoverable under the privilege, the facts learned may have to be provided in response 
to properly phrased discovery requests. Similarly, the privilege does not prevent discovery of 
the identity of witnesses and the existence of interview notes, tapes, or transcripts. The extent 
to which interview notes, transcripts, and other factual reports prepared in anticipation of 
litigation are actually protected from discovery by a party opponent may vary between 
jurisdictions and may depend on the facts and circumstances of a given case. 
 
Waiver of Work Product Protection 
Like the attorney-client privilege, work product protection can be waived. Moreover, the 
Federal Rule of Evidence 502 expressly applies to disclosure of a communication or 
information covered by work product protection. Therefore, the examiner should abide by 
the same rules governing disclosure of materials protected by the attorney-client privilege.  
 
Work Product Protection and Outside Auditors 
In late 2004, a federal district judge in New York, under the work product doctrine, protected 
the results of an internal investigation of a large company given to an outside auditor (Merrill 
Lynch & Co., Inc. v. Allegheny Energy, Inc., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21543). However, courts 
continue to disagree as to whether such disclosure waives work product protection under the 
Federal Rules of Evidence. 
  
Before disclosing work product to an outside auditor, a company should determine whether 
the outside auditor is an “adversary.” Some courts consider auditors to be the “watchdogs” of 
companies, and therefore inherently adversary to their corporate clients. Certainly, the role of 
outside auditors is to independently ensure the accuracy of a company’s financials, find 
Law  Basic Principles of Evidence 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.731 
inaccuracies, and detect fraud. However, the court in Merrill Lynch distinguished this kind of 
adversary from a “litigation adversary.” A company’s auditor is not necessarily a “litigation 
adversary” (which is required to invalidate the work product privilege). Rather, “[a] business 
and its auditor can and should be aligned insofar as they both seek to prevent, detect, and 
root out corporate fraud.”  
 
The court also emphasized that a blanket waiver of privilege in this kind of situation would 
likely discourage ethical disclosure and conduct by companies. Thus, the trend in litigation 
seems to review the facts on a case-by-case basis to determine whether an auditor and 
company share common interests and therefore are non-adversarial.  
 
The following principles should aid companies in determining whether they should provide 
work product to outside auditors: (1) ensure a common interest between the company and 
the outside auditor; (2) only disclose information necessary to help the auditor assess 
sufficiency of the company’s controls and the accuracy of the company’s audit/accounting 
procedures; and (3) when disclosing informati on, always include a confidentiality agreement 
acknowledging that the documents were prepared by counsel and therefore privileged, as well 
as a covenant that the outside auditor is to maintain the strictest confidence of the 
documents.  
 
Self-Evaluation Privilege 
The self-evaluation privilege (also referred to as the self-critical privilege) may provide some 
protection for the investigative work product. This privilege is based on the need to 
encourage voluntary internal reviews and compliance programs. It applies if an organization 
can demonstrate that it is attempting to police itself in an area of public interest, and that 
disclosure of the work product would prejudice such efforts. The privilege is a relatively new 
concept and is not recognized in all jurisdictions. It is much weaker than the attorney-client 
and attorney work product privileges. 
 
Marital Privilege 
Additionally, the marital privilege protects communications between husbands and wives. 
There are two forms of the marital or spousal privilege: (1) the confidential communications 
privilege, enabling either spouse to prevent the other from testifying regarding a 
communication during marriage between the two that was intended to be in confidence, and 
(2) the adverse testimony privilege, protecting spouses from being compelled to testify against each 
other while they are married. Usually, the confidential communications privilege continues 
Basic Principles of Evidence  Law 
2.732  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
after the termination of the marriage; the adverse testimony privilege does not.  
 
There is no privilege that permits a person not to testify against other family members, 
although, as a matter of policy, many law enforcement agencies will not compel testimony 
from immediate family members. 
 
Law Enforcement Privilege to Withhold the Identity of an Informant 
Law enforcement agencies may legitimately withhold the identity of an informant unless 
disclosure is necessary to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial. In such circumstances, 
the prosecution has to decide whether to forego prosecution or disclose the identity of the 
informant. In the private sector, there is no equivalent privilege. Certified Fraud Examiners or 
others who are investigating on behalf of a private client may be compelled by court order to 
disclose the identity of an informant or any other witness. This possibility should be disclosed 
to potential witnesses who may request confidentiality. See the Investigation Section of the 
Fraud Examiners Manual for more information. 
 
Accountant-Client Privilege 
A few states have a weak accountant-client privilege that allows an accountant to resist 
production of a client’s work papers or documents. No such privilege is recognized in federal 
court, and the state privileges may be overcome by a showing of need or by the service of a 
subpoena.  
 
There is, however, a Federally Authorized Tax Practitioner Privilege under section 7525 of 
the Internal Revenue Code. This privilege is a evidentiary privilege that provides limited 
protection in federal tax law.  It applies only in situations where a CPA is providing tax advice  
in noncriminal proceedings before the IRS or before a federal court.  
 
Nevertheless, as discussed above, in federal proceedings, communications between a client 
and a third-party, such as an accountant, may be protected under the attorney-client privilege 
or the attorney work product doctrine.  
 
The attorney-client privilege extends to accountants if the attorney hired the accountant to 
assist in rendering legal advice. Additionally, the privilege extends to an accountant’s 
documents, which were made at the attorney’s request, used to render legal advice. This 
privilege was clarified in U.S. v. Cote, which concluded that there is no protection for 
accounting services if no legal advice was sought. In Cote, the client engaged the accountant 
Law  Basic Principles of Evidence 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.733 
before retaining the lawyer, the client and accountant had a long-standing professional 
relationship, and the attorney did not control or supervise the accountant’s efforts or work 
product.  
 
In addition, the attorney work product protection extends to information and documents 
prepared by the consultants and examiners hired by the attorneys, including accountants. 
However, any protection will be waived if the accountant is called to testify as an expert 
witness at trial.  
 
In cases where accountants serve as expert witnesses, the work product doctrine may apply. 
Protection under the work product doctrine generally depends on whether the accountant 
serves as a testifying expert or a non-testifying (consulting) expert. Nothing created by the 
testifying expert is privileged from discovery. Conversely, the rules of discovery generally 
protect communications between a non-testifying expert, the attorney, and the party from 
disclosure to adversaries. However, the protection against disclosure of communications with 
non-testifying experts can be lost, and this commonly occurs when the non-testifying expert’s 
communications are released to others, particularly to testifying experts. This topic is 
discussed in further detail below.  
 
There are a number of other privileges that are less likely to be asserted in fraud actions, 
including the priest-penitent  and physician-patient  privileges.
