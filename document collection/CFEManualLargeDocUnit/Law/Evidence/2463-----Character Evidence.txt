Character Evidence 
In civil and criminal trials, there is strong policy against character evidence (FRE 404). 
Character evidence (sometimes called propensity evidence) is testimony or exhibits that 
purport to establish a “trait of character” or propensity to behave in a particular way, such as 
carefulness, honesty, violence, or cowardice. There are some good reasons to leave character  
out of the discussion whenever possible, such as the subjective nature of the description —
one person’s “gruff” is another viewer’s “aggressive.”  
 
Additionally, character is not an absolute indicator of behavior. That is, it is pretty common 
to remark how “out of character” somebody’s actions were in a given situation. So there is 
always a chance someone was acting out of character, making the behavioral propensity (if 
there was one) useless in the legal exchange. 
 
Finally, testimony about character has a reckless potential to be mistakenly founded, misled, 
or concocted. It is always possible to “misjudge” someone, especially if we only know the 
person in limited circumstances like work or a social club. Moreover, it is exceedingly easy to 
fabricate incidents about character and, for shrewd talkers, to manipulate perceptions of

personality. In a fraud case, it must be shown that the defendant committed the act in 
question. There is too great a danger of prejudicing the jury if you allow testimony about the 
defendant just being a bad person. Whether he is a bad person or not ought to have no 
bearing on whether or not he committed the act in question. 
 
In general, character evidence is not admissible. In civil cases, character evidence is rarely 
admissible, and the general rule in criminal cases provides that evidence of a defendant’s bad 
character is not admissible at trial. For example, the government cannot offer evidence of a 
defendant’s prior crimes or other bad acts to prove the defendant’s bad character.  
 
There are, however, some instances where character evidence may be admitted in criminal 
trials. Some of the exceptions for use of character evidence in criminal cases include:  
• The accused may offer evidence of his good character, in which case the prosecution may 
introduce evidence of the accused’s bad character. 
• Character evidence may be admissible to reflect on the credibility of a witness. 
 
Under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or 
acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person. In other words, such evidence is not 
admissible to prove that the defendant is generally a bad person, and therefore is likely to 
have committed the crime with which he is charged. For example, if a defendant is charged 
with stealing money from his employer’s safe, the prosecution would not be permitted to 
offer evidence that the defendant had previously stolen money from another employer to 
show the defendant had a propensity to steal.  
 
However, there are some uses of character evidence that may be admissible because they are 
offered for a purpose other than showing character. Some of the exceptions for use of 
character evidence in criminal cases include: 
• To show the accused’s knowledge, intent, or motive for the crime 
• To prove the existence of a larger plan of which the charged crime is a part 
• To show the accused’s preparation to commit the charged crime 
• To show the accused’s ability and means of committing the crime (possession of a 
weapon, tool, or skill used in the commission of the act) 
• To show the accused’s opportunity to commit the crime 
• Threats or expressions of ill will by the accused 
• To link the accused to physical evidence at the scene 
• The suspect’s conduct and comments during arrest
