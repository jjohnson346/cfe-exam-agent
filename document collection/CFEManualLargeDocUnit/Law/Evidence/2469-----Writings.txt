Writings 
In general, authentication of a writing consists of establishing who authored the document. 
Depending on the document and situation, this is done in one of several ways: (1) the author 
testifies and claims authorship; (2) a witness testifies to seeing the author write the document; 
(3) with handwritten letters, a witness verifies the author’s penmanship; (4) with typed or 
machine-written documents, the witness verifies the author’s signature; (5) a witness testifies 
that the contents of the document point decisively to the author. These and many other 
document issues may require the participation of a questioned documents expert.
