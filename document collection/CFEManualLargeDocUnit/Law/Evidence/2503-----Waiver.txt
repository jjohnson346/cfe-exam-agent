Waiver 
Special care should be taken to ensure that the attorney-client privilege is not waived 
inadvertently by giving documents or communicating information to anyone outside the 
investigation team, including members of law enforcement. If information gathered during an 
investigation is shared with law enforcement, then the privilege may be waived not only as to 
the information given, but also to any other information relating to the same subject matter.  
 
For example, if an investigator submits a copy of his report to the prosecutor who initiates 
criminal proceedings based on the findings in the report, the criminal defendant may be able 
to require the investigator to provide all the documents he used in writing the report. In such 
an instance, the investigator may be considered to have waived the privilege. Likewise, if law 
enforcement requests the results of an investigation or information gathered during an 
investigation, the attorney should be consulted before turning over the information. Some 
Law  Basic Principles of Evidence 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.727 
courts have held that the privilege is not waived if a company is subpoenaed to produce the 
information.
