Electronically Stored Information 
Currently, there is still much controversy regarding how to authenticate electronically stored 
information (ESI). The U.S. Department of Justice’s Computer Crime and Intellectual 
Basic Principles of Evidence  Law 
2.710  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Property Section has developed a manual for electronic search and seizure, which judges have 
used as a guide as to whether digital evidence has been properly seized. If digital evidence 
needs to be seized, it is vital that examiners engage the services of a trained computer forensic 
technician. A properly trained technician should know the procedures to follow to ensure that 
the files can be authenticated. 
 
Generally, to be admissible, ESI evidence must meet the same authentication standards as 
hard copy documents (i.e., to show that the item is what the proponent claims); however, 
courts have recognized that the authentication of ESI evidence may require greater scrutiny 
because ESI can easily be altered after creation. Thus, to prove that a particular electronic 
document is authentic, those offering the evidence must demonstrate that the original 
document was not modified after its creation.  
 
Rule 901 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides a non-exclusive, explicative list of 
methods by which evidence can be authenticated, and some of the methods may be used to 
authenticate ESI. Rule 901(b)(1) allows authentication through testimony of a witness with 
knowledge that a matter is what it is claimed to be. Additionally, Rule 901(b)(3) allows for 
authentication by comparison to already authenticated evidence by an expert witness or the 
trier of fact. Similarly, Rule 901(b)(4) allows authentication by circumstantial evidence of 
distinctive characteristics (e.g., hash values or metadata).  
 
Furthermore, under Rule 902, some documents are self-authenticating, which means that they 
may be received into evidence without independent proof of authenticity. For ESI purposes, 
the three most relevant categories of self-authenticating documents are official publications, 
trade inscriptions, and certified copies of business records.  
 
In addition, different forms of ESI evidence may require different authentication approaches. 
Therefore, it is helpful to examine a few common types.  
 
E-MAIL 
Unlike traditional business letters written on formal letterhead, e-mails are more prone to 
authenticity issues and may be more difficult to properly authenticate. For example, the judge 
in Lorraine v. Markel, 241 F.R.D. 534 (D. Md. 2007) refused to allow either party to offer e-mails
of an arbitration negotiation as evidence, finding that neither party authenticated the e-mails 
by simply attaching them to their motions as exhibits. 
 
Law  Basic Principles of Evidence 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.711 
E-mail authenticity issues usually arise because e-mail systems are unreliable and inherently 
unsecure, making e-mails susceptible to alteration. Moreover, e-mails can lack reliability 
because the identities of senders can be corrupted through unauthorized access and use.  
 
Even so, there are numerous ways e-mail can be authenticated, including:  
• Witness with personal knowledge (e.g., a witness testifies that he recognizes a copy of an 
e-mail that he received or drafted) 
• Comparison with authenticated examples (e.g., if one e-mail has been properly 
authenticated, a second e-mail could by authenticated by comparing it with the first) 
• Circumstantial evidence of distinctive characteristics (e.g., the presence of a party’s name 
and e-mail address or the presence of metadata) 
• Trade inscriptions purporting to have been affixed in the course of business and 
indicating ownership, control, or origin (e.g., an automatic business signature at the end of 
the e-mail) 
• Certified copies of business records (e.g., e-mail is accompanied by a written certification 
by its custodian) 
 
TEXT AND INSTANT MESSAGES 
As the use of text and instant messages continues to grow, parties are offering this ESI as 
evidence in an increasing number of cases. However, given the nature of this type of 
evidence, parties often encounter foundational issues when authenticating text and instant 
messages. Notwithstanding the novel technology involved, these types of ESI can be 
admissible when the proponent offers direct or circumstantial evidence as to its authenticity. 
The most likely authenticate chat room and text messages are: 
• Witness with personal knowledge (e.g., a witness testifies that he recognizes a copy 
messages that he received or drafted) 
• Circumstantial evidence of distinctive characteristics (e.g., the use of the defendant’s name 
in the text messages and the subject matter of the messages) 
 
COMPUTER RECORDS  
Courts typically accept computer files and documents as evidence. In fact, courts themselves 
are using more electronic resources because many aspects of litigation can now be conducted 
electronically. 
 
Traditionally, to be admitted as evidence, computerized records need only meet the usual 
business-records authentication, which requires that the computerized records be 
Basic Principles of Evidence  Law 
2.712  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
accompanied by certification by a qualified person stating that (1) the records were prepared 
reasonably near the time of the event they describe, (2) the records were prepared as a usual 
part of doing business, and (3) the organization’s way of keeping records is demonstrably 
reliable.  
 
The required supporting material to authenticate computer records will include information 
on the computing machine used, any software, and the record-keeping process. A business 
record, electronic or otherwise, is legal as long as it’s kept in the normal course of business. 
When there are clear routines for compiling information, admitting the record into court will 
be routine.  
 
Recently, however, courts have recognized that authentication of computerized records may 
require greater scrutiny because, unlike other ESI evidence, the primary authentication issue 
regarding computerized records is what has, or may have, happened to the record in the time 
between when it was entered in the files and the time of trial. Based upon this view, the most 
likely methods of authenticating computerized records are: 
• Witness with personal knowledge (e.g., an authenticating witness attests to the process by 
which the computerized records are created, acquired, maintained, and preserved) 
• Circumstantial evidence of distinctive characteristics (e.g., a person’s business habit is 
consistent with the document) 
• Certified copies of business records (e.g., computerized records are accompanied by 
custodian’s written certification)
