Then Existing Mental, Emotional, or Physical Condition  
Statements of the declarant’s then-existing state of mind, emotion, or physical condition are 
also admissible as exceptions to the hearsay rule. Specifically, the Federal Rule of Evidence 
803 lists “state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition …, pain, and bodily health”

as acceptable subject matter, along with extremely personalized thought processes such as 
“intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling ….”  
 
Defense attorneys at a fraud trial sometimes use arguments about what their client intended, or 
the confusion and stress the person was suffering. For instance, the defendant was seen 
shredding documents, and he was overheard to say, “They’ll never prove anything now.” The 
statement may be admitted to show the defendant’s state of mind at the time he was 
shredding the documents. It also shows that the defendant acted with the intent to destroy 
the documents. Hearsay statements that help establish this intention are admissible as 
exceptions.
