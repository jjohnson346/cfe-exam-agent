The “Best Evidence” Rule 
Sometimes testimony may be rejected because of the “best evidence” rule, which prohibits a 
party from testifying about the contents of a document without producing the document 
itself. This rule, however, only applies when an original or copy is being used to prove the 
contents of a writing.  
 
Also known as the “original writing” rule, the best evidence rule provides that when a witness 
testifies about the contents of a document, at least a fair copy of the original must be available 
for inspection. If there is no original, a copy of the proven authentic document will do, but 
the court must be assured that the copies are reliable and accurate. If the document is lost —
no original, no copies — the judge will have to be convinced there is good reason to forgo the 
exhibit and admit the testimony.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.715 
Fraud examiners can use copies in preparing their case reports, but at trial, the original must 
be produced if it is available. Thus, when public records are involved in a fraud examination, 
examiners should always obtain certified copies. 
 
With regard to computerized data, the best evidence rule does not require the party offering 
ESI as evidence to bring the original custodian’s computer, monitor, and other equipment to 
display the information at trial. Rather, Rule 1001(3) provides that an original writing includes 
any printout or other “output readable by sight, shown to reflect the data accurately.” Thus, 
hard-copy printouts of documents, e-mail, and other ESI qualify as originals under the 
Federal Rules of Evidence.
