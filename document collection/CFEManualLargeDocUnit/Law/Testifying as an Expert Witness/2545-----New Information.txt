Testifying as an Expert Witness


:


New Information 
Opposing counsel may introduce new information of which the expert might not be aware. 
This normally is done to introduce confusion in the witness’s mind in the hope that the 
witness might contradict himself or develop a series of alternate scenarios given the new 
information to show that the existing report and opinions are no longer of value.
