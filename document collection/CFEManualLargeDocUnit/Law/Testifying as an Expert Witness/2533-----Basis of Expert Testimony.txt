Testifying as an Expert Witness


:


Basis of Expert Testimony 
Rule 703 of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs the sources on which experts may base 
their testimony. It provides that experts may rely on facts or data made known to the expert at 
or before the hearing: 
 
The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may 
be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably 
relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the 
facts or data need not be admissible in evidence in order for the opinion or inference to be 
admitted.  
 
Therefore, under Rule 703, an expert may base an opinion on:  
• Firsthand observations 
• Facts, data, or opinions presented at trial 
• Facts, data, or opinions conveyed outside of court

In addition, under Rule 703, experts can rely on inadmissible hearsay or other inadmissible 
evidence as long as it is the type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field — a 
determination that is left to the discretion of the trial judge. This rule allows an expert to 
employ data usually used by experts in the field, though the data itself may not be admissible. 
An example might be a table of interest rates taken from a Department of Commerce 
publication. Similarly, an accountant serving as an expert witness may rely on private sources 
in forming an opinion if such sources normally are relied upon by accountants.  
 
The majority of states, however, follow the common law rule, which permits a more limited 
basis for expert testimony. Most states require the expert to predicate testimony on firsthand 
perception, or in the alternative, information “admitted in evidence at the hearing” at which 
he is called to testify.
