MANDATORY DISCLOSURE RULE (FAR 3.1003(A)(2)) 
On December 12, 2008, a major revision to the FAR went into effect. Among other things, 
the revised FAR provisions require all government contractors to disclose “credible 
evidence” of criminal fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations found in Title 
18, as well as violations of the civil False Claims Act. Furthermore, the mandatory disclosure 
rules require that the contractor make reports to two different offices: the inspector general 
and the affected contracting officer. In addition, the mandatory disclosure rules make the 
failure to disclose violations a basis for suspension and debarment.
