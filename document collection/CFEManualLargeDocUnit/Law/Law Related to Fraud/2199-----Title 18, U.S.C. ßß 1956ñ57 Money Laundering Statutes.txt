Title 18, U.S.C. §§ 1956–57 Money Laundering Statutes 
In addition to the BSA, Congress enacted sections 1956 and 1957 of Title 18, which emanate 
from the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, to combat money laundering. These complex 
statutes forbid money laundering  in connection criminal activity, including but not limited to 
narcotics trafficking.  
 
LAUNDERING OF MONETARY INSTRUMENTS (18 U.S.C. § 1956) 
Section 1956 addresses financial transactions involving proceeds of criminal activity. It 
covers three types of money laundering, which are found in sections 1956(a)(1), 1956(a)(2), 
and 1956(a)(3).  
 
Section 1956(a)(1) concerns domestic money laundering. To establish an offense under 
section 1956(a)(1), the government must establish that “(1) the defendant took part in a 
financial transaction; (2) the defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction 
involved the proceeds of illegal activity; (3) that the property involved was in fact the 
proceeds of that illegal activity; and (4) the defendant knew that the transaction was designed 
in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, source, location, ownership, or control 
of the illegal proceeds.” U.S. v. Ruiz-Castro, 92 F.3d 1519 (10th Cir. 1996).

2.328  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Individuals who violate Section 1956(a)(1) may be fined up to $500,000 or twice the value of 
the monetary instrument or funds (whichever is greater) and imprisoned for up to 20 years. 
Also, assets acquired because of violations of this provision are subject to forfeiture by the 
government. 
 
Section 1956(a)(2) pertains to international money laundering. Section 1956(a)(2) prohibits 
the transportation, transmission, or transfer of funds either into or out of the United States 
if the person knows the funds are the proceeds of unlawful activity and the transportation, 
transmission, or transfer is done with the intent to promote the carrying on of “specified 
unlawful conduct”; is done to conceal the natu re, location, source, ownership, or control of 
the funds; or is done to avoid reporting requirements. The penalties are the same as those set 
forth in section 1956(a)(1).  
 
Section 1956(a)(3) prohibits a person from engaging in financial transactions involving 
property the person believes to be the proceeds of illegal activity. This is intended to cover 
sting operations in which a suspect engages in money laundering activity with funds he 
believes to be illegally derived, even though the funds are actually supplied by government 
agents. A person who violates this provision can be imprisoned for up to 20 years and/or 
fined in accordance with 18, U.S.C., § 3571. 
 
Property qualifies as the proceeds of illegal activity if it is derived from a “specified unlawful 
activity,” which includes narcotics-related transactions, transactions related to bankruptcy 
fraud, bribery, false statements, embezzlement, mail or wire fraud, bank fraud, 
environmental violations, health care offenses, and a number of other crimes.  
 
Additionally, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 added terrorism activities, bribery of public 
officials, smuggling, and export control violations to the list of unlawful activities that give 
rise to violations of this law.  
 
On May 21, 2009, President Obama signed into law the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery 
Act of 2009 (FERA). Congress designed FERA to providing federal authorities additional 
tools and resources to prosecute fraudulent financial practices. Among other measures, the 
legislation amends section 1956(c) to broaden the term proceeds to include the gross receipts 
of unlawful activity, rather than merely its profits. This amendment addresses a recent 
Supreme Court ruling that proceeds of criminal activity, as treated by federal money 
laundering statutes, included only the defendant’s profits of such activity.

ENGAGING IN MONETARY TRANSACTIONS IN PROPERTY DERIVED FROM SPECIFIED UNLAWFUL ACTIVITY (18 U.S.C. § 1957) 
Section 1957 makes it illegal for any person to knowingly engage or attempt to engage in a 
monetary transaction with criminally derived property greater than $10,000 and is derived 
from “specified unlawful activity.” Section 1957 applies in situations where the offense takes 
place in the United States (or within its special maritime or territorial jurisdiction) or the 
offense takes place outside the United States, and the defendant is a U.S. citizen or legal 
alien. Violations of this statute are punished by fines, up to 10 years of imprisonment, and 
forfeiture of illegally obtained gains.
