ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES 
To help ensure that the government is dealing only with responsible contractors, the 
government uses suspension and debarment of contractors for certain offenses. The current 
regulations governing the debarment and suspension of federal government contractors are 
set forth in subpart 9.4 of the FAR.  
 
Suspension and debarment are administrative sanctions that disqualify contractors from 
government contracting and subcontracting. Suspension refers to an action taken by a 
suspending official to temporarily disqualify a contractor from government contracting. The 
government may suspend a contractor upon “adequate evidence” that the party has 
committed certain civil or criminal offenses. 
 
Debarment is defined as the action taken by a debarr ing official to exclude a contractor from 
government contracting for a specified period. Debarment actions require that this sanction 
be established by a “preponderance of the evidence” that the person engaged in conduct 
warranting debarment.
