CIVIL CERTIFICATIONS (SARBANES-OXLEY § 302) 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 302 requires the CEO and CFO to personally certify the following 
six items in every annual and quarterly report:  
1. They have personally reviewed the report. 
2. Based on their knowledge, the report does not contain any material misstatement that 
would render the financials misleading. 
3. Based on their knowledge, the financial information in the report fairly presents in all 
material respects the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow of the 
company. 
4. They are responsible for designing, maintaining, and evaluating the company’s internal 
controls; they have evaluated the controls within 90 days prior to the report; and they 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.219 
have presented their conclusions about the effectiveness of those controls in the report. 
5. They have disclosed to the auditors and the audit committee any material weaknesses in 
the controls and any fraud, whether material or not, that involves management or other 
employees who have a significant role in the company’s internal controls. 
6. They have indicated in their report whether there have been significant changes in the 
company’s internal controls since the filing of the last report. 
 
Note that in items two and three, the CEO and CFO are not required to certify that the 
financials are accurate or that there is no misstatement. They are simply required to certify 
that to their knowledge the financials are accurate and not misleading. This does not mean, 
however, that senior financial officers can simply plead ignorance about their companies’ 
SEC filings to avoid liability.  
 
Furthermore, the term fairly presents in item three is a broader standard than what is required 
by GAAP. In certifying that their SEC filings meet this standard, the CEO and CFO 
essentially must certify that the company (1) has selected appropriate accounting policies to 
ensure the material accuracy of the reports; (2) has properly applied those accounting 
standards; and (3) has disclosed financial information that reflects the underlying 
transactions and events of the company. Furthermore, the other certification rules (see items 
one, four, five, and six above) mandate that CEOs  and CFOs take an active role in their 
companies’ public reporting and in the design and maintenance of internal controls. 
 
Also, it is significant that in item four, the CEO and CFO not only have to certify that they 
are responsible for their companies’ internal controls, but also that they have evaluated the 
controls within 90 days prior to their quarterly or annual report.  Essentially, this certification 
requirement mandates that companies actively and continually re-evaluate their control 
structures to prevent fraud. 
 
In conjunction with the Sarbanes-Oxley section 302 certification requirements on the 
responsibility of the CEO and CFO for internal controls, Sarbanes-Oxley section 404 
requires all annual reports to contain an internal control report that (1) states management’s 
responsibility for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and 
procedures for financial reporting; and (2) contains an assessment of the effectiveness of the 
internal control structure and procedures of the company for financial reporting.  
 
Item five requires the CEO and CFO to certify that they have disclosed to their auditors and 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.220  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
their audit committee any material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls, and any 
fraud, whether material or not, that involves management or other key employees. Obviously, 
this is a very broad reporting standard that goes beyond the “material” standard 
contemplated in auditing standards. The CEO and CFO now must report to their auditors 
and audit committee any fraud committed by a manager. This places a greater burden on the 
CEO and CFO to take part in anti-fraud efforts and to be aware of fraudulent activity within 
their companies to meet this certification requirement.  
 
Item six is significant because periodic SEC filings must now include statements detailing 
significant changes to the internal controls of publicly traded companies. 
 
The overall effect of these certification requirements is to force CEOs and CFOs to take an 
active role in the anti-fraud efforts of their companies, making internal controls and fraud 
prevention a high priority.
