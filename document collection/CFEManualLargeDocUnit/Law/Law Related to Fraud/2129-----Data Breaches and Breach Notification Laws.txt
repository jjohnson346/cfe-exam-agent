Data Breaches and Breach Notification Laws 
Businesses with inadequate security safeguards not only leave customers’ confidential data 
vulnerable to misuse or theft, but also increase their risk of regulatory or legal action, direct 
economic loss, and loss of consumer confidence. 
 
EXAMPLE  
In September 2009, TJX Companies (the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, 
HomeGoods, and other enterprises) agreed to pay $525,000 to settle a class-action suit filed by 
several banks related to the data breach of its computer system in which hackers compromised 
94 million credit and debit card numbers. According to investigations, inadequate security 
safeguards allowed hackers to access and steal this information. This settlement is one of several 
for TJX, which has estimated that it will spend more than $250 million to address network-security 
weaknesses and respond to lawsuits, investigations, and other claims stemming from the 
breach. 
 
EXAMPLE  
On November 20, 2009, the Hartford Courant reported that Health Net, a health insurance 
provider, lost a portable, external hard drive with unencrypted personal information of 
approximately 1.5 million customers. The missing data included Social Security numbers and 
bank account numbers of Health Net members in Arizona, Connecticut, New Jersey, and 
New York. Although the hard drive reportedly disappeared from Health Net’s office in May 
2009, the company waited six months before disclosing the breach. According to the 
Connecticut Attorney General, Health Net may be in violation of state notification laws that 
require companies to inform consumers of data breaches without unreasonable delay.

Data breaches are one of the largest contributors to the escalating problem of identity theft, 
which costs Americans more than $50 billion each year. In fact, the Identity Theft Resource 
Center, a nonprofit organization dedicated to understanding and preventing identity theft, 
estimates that in 2008, data breaches left more than 35 million personal records exposed. 
 
Although these cases and statistics illustrate why strengthening information-security practices 
should become a high priority for management in all types of organizations, complying with 
U.S. privacy laws and regulations is becoming increasingly complex. This is primarily because 
the United States uses a sectoral approach to protect information. This approach, which 
relies on a mix of legislation, regulation, and self-regulation, creates a system in which 
privacy standards emerge from a complex interplay of overlapping state and federal laws and 
regulations, as well as industry practices.  
 
In addition to a complex regulatory framework, organizations across various industries have 
experienced a significant increase in the number of information privacy laws and regulations 
affecting their operations. Particularly due to an onslaught of data-breach stories like the 
ones above, concerns about the privacy of personal information have escalated, and this has 
compelled government authorities to enact stronger consumer-protection legislation and 
enhance enforcement efforts to identify and prosecute violations of laws protecting private-
 consumer information. 
 
Although businesses have become subject to a growing number of privacy laws and 
regulations, information-privacy regulation in the United States is more prevalent in areas 
where abuses of personal information are most likely to occur, such as the financial and 
health care industries.  
 
This increasingly complex area of law poses significant compliance challenges for 
organizations operating in regulated industries. In this environment, management must 
understand the complicated and expanding area of privacy law and continually work to 
ensure that their organizations have and follow appropriate procedures and protocols 
addressing information privacy. 
 
This section seeks to provide a general overview on the subject by briefly examining some 
important laws, regulations, and standards designed to protect the privacy, security, and 
confidentiality of customer data. The discussion below is divided into the following  
  
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.268  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
categories: financial privacy, private health in formation, and privacy protections applying to 
businesses in other industries. 
 
PRIVATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
Privacy protections in the financial services industry are primarily contained in the Fair and 
Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.  
 
FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT’S RED FLAG RULES  
In 2007, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued final rules and guidelines (Red Flag 
Rules) implementing sections 114 and 315 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act 
(FACTA).The Red Flag Rules require financial institutions and certain creditors to develop 
and implement a formal written program to identify, detect, and respond to red flags of 
possible identity theft. 
 
See the chapter on “Financial Institution Fraud” in the Financial Transactions and Fraud 
Schemes section of the Fraud Examiners Manual for more information about the Red Flag 
Rules. 
 
GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT  
Like FACTA’s Red Flag Rules, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which protects customers’ 
financial information held by banks working in personal finance, imposes privacy obligations 
on financial institutions. Specifically, financial institutions have privacy obligations under the 
Financial Privacy Rule and the Safeguards Rule of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. 
 
The Financial Privacy Rule requires financial institutions to provide their customers with 
privacy notices explaining the institution’s policies for collecting and sharing personal 
financial information. The Financial Privacy Rule also applies to companies — whether or not 
they are financial institutions — that receive personal financial information. 
 
Conversely, the Safeguards Rule requires all financial institutions to design, implement, and 
maintain safeguards to protect the confidentiality and integrity of customers’ personal 
information. The Safeguards Rule applies not only to financial institutions that collect 
information from their own customers, but also to financial institutions that receive 
customer information from other financial institutions. 
 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.269 
PRIVATE HEALTH INFORMATION 
In addition, certain businesses may need to consider adopting a set of policies and 
procedures to safeguard private health information, which includes any identifiable 
information that relates to a patient’s health, health care, or payment for health care. Federal 
privacy protections for consumers’ health care information are primarily located in the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information 
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act). 
 
THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT  
Although Congress originally enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA) to protect health insurance coverage for workers and their families, it 
expanded the law to protect patient health information. The HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to 
health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses that electronically transmit 
health information in connection with a covered transaction, and it governs access to and 
use of “protected health information,” which includes any identifiable information that 
relates to a patient’s health, health care, or payment for health care. 
 
The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally provides that covered entities cannot use or disclose any 
protected health information except as authorized by the subject of that information or as 
specifically required or authorized by the regulations. It also provides that when the use or 
disclosure of such information is permitted, covered entities must make all reasonable efforts 
to use or disclose the minimum amount of protected information necessary to accomplish 
the intended purpose.  
 
If protected health information becomes an issue during a fraud examination, the examiner 
should immediately contact the human resources (HR) department. The HR department 
should have information about whether the entity is subject to HIPAA rules and can help 
the examiner comply with those rules.  
 
The most important thing to note is that if HIPAA rules do apply, examiners are restricted 
as to the type of health information they can access without specific written authorization. 
Examiners should never contact the health care provider, the health-plan administrator, or a 
medical-billing service for copies of employee’s records without first consulting the 
employer’s legal counsel or HR department. 
 
 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.270  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
THE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR ECONOMIC AND CLINICAL HEALTH ACT  
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), which was enacted on 
February 17, 2009, contains many compliance challenges for entities that create, maintain, 
disclose, or use health information. Title XIII of ARRA, the Health Information Technology 
for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), imposed additional requirements for 
notifications of federal security breaches and added numerous privacy and data security 
restrictions for covered entities under HIPAA. The act also increased the maximum fine 
under HIPAA from $100,000 to $1,500,000. 
 
BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL AND HEALTH CARE INDUSTRIES 
Even if managers believe their companies fall outside of the financial services or health care 
industries, they should determine if they are creditors under the Red Flag Rules and look to 
state laws and industry standards, especially the Payment Card Industry’s Data Security 
Standard (PCI DSS). 
 
STATE PRIVACY LAWS  
In addition to the federal laws summarized above, specific state laws may regulate the 
collection and use of personal information by businesses in the private sector. During the 
past few years, states have been aggressive in creating protections for personal information, 
and these protections typically apply to a broad set of personal information and extend to all 
businesses operating in the state.  
 
Of particular concern for businesses are state laws pertaining to breach notification. Most 
states have responded to the escalating number of security breaches by enacting these laws, 
which typically require businesses to notify their customers of a security breach involving 
personal information.  
 
Although most states’ breach-notification laws contain similar provisions, they contain 
varying definitions of personal information and require different types of notification. 
Therefore, before establishing new policies and practices concerning the handling of  
  
                                                 
2As of April 12, 2010, 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have enacted 
legislation requiring notification of security breaches involving personal information. For a list of state breach 
notification laws, visit the National Conference of State Legislatures website at www.ncsl.org.   
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.271 
personal information, management should consult with legal counsel to identify what laws 
apply.  
 
PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY’S DATA SECURITY STANDARD  
In addition to state laws, management must be aware of its industry-specific data security 
standards, such as the Payment Card Industry’s Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), one of 
the most important private-industry data-security standards. 
 
Developed by the five major credit card companies (American Express, Discover, JCB, 
MasterCard, and Visa) to prevent security issues, the PCI DSS is a comprehensive set of 
security due diligence practices to help ensure the safe handling of payment card data. All 
companies that store, process, or transmit credit or debit card data must comply with this set 
of standards. 
 
The PCI DSS framework comprises the following 12 security requirements: 
• Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data. 
• Do not use vendor-supplied defaults of system passwords and other security parameters. 
• Protect stored cardholder data. 
• Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks. 
• Use and regularly update anti-virus software or programs. 
• Develop and maintain secure systems and applications. 
• Restrict access to cardholder data on a need-to-know basis. 
• Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access. 
• Restrict physical access to cardholder data. 
• Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data. 
• Regularly test security systems and processes. 
• Maintain a policy that addresses information security for employees and contractors. 
 
Failure to comply with PCI DSS can result in severe consequences imposed by the card 
brands, including: 
• Fines up to $500,000 per data breach if data is compromised 
• Fines up to $25,000 per month until compliance is obtained 
• Liability for all fraud losses incurred from compromised account numbers 
• Loss of ability to process payment card transactions 
 
And while the federal government has not mandated compliance with the PCI DSS, some 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.272  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
state laws force elements of the PCI DSS into law, and several states have considered 
amending their breach-notification laws to include liability for an organization’s failure to 
adopt certain safeguards required by the PCI DSS.
