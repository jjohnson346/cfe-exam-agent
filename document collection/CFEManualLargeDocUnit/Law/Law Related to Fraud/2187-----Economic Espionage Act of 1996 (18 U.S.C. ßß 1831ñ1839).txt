Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. §§ 1831–1839) 
The Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (EEA) made the theft of trade secrets a federal 
criminal offense. The Department of Justice now has sweeping authority to prosecute trade 
secret theft whether it is in the United States, via the Internet, or outside the United States. 
 
Section 1839 defines trade secrets as any secret “patterns, plans, compilations, program 
devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, 
programs, or codes” that have some independ ent economic value and are used to obtain an 
economic advantage over competitors or customers. Furthermore, the EEA applies to 
anyone who, without authorization, copies, duplicates, “downloads, uploads, alters, destroys 
... replicates, transmits, delivers, sends, mails, communicates, or conveys a trade secret.” 
 
The EEA outlaws two types of trade secret misappropriation: economic espionage and theft 
of commercial trade secrets. Section 1831 criminalizes the theft of a trade secret to benefit a 
foreign government, instrumentality, or agent. Section 1832, however, criminalizes the theft 
of commercial trade secrets to obtain an economic advantage. Both sections are examined in 
more detail below.  
 
Prosecutors can apply the EEA to a wide variety of misconduct because it criminalizes 
attempts and conspiracies to violate the EEA. The same penalties apply to these offenses 
with increased penalties if the trade secret misappropriation benefits a foreign government, 
foreign instrumentality, or a foreign agent.  
 
Section 1834 of the EEA allows criminal forfeiture to the United States of (1) any property 
constituting or derived from the proceeds of violations of the Act, and (2) the forfeiture of 
any property used or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit or facilitate a 
violation of the Act. (See 18 U.S.C. § 1834.) The criminal forfeiture provisions enable federal 
prosecutors to dismantle entire Internet networks and seek criminal forfeiture of all the 
computers, printers and other devices used to commit or facilitate the offenses proscribed by 
the Act.  
 
The EEA also authorizes the attorney general, deputy attorney general, or assistant attorney 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.322  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
general in the Criminal Division of the Justice Department to apply for a federal court order 
authorizing or approving the interception of wire or oral communications by the FBI or 
other federal agencies having responsibility for the investigation of the offense. These are the 
same investigative tools available in other federal criminal prosecutions. 
 
The EEA also applies to offenses committed outside the United States if (1) the offender is 
a citizen or permanent resident alien of the United States, (2) if the corporation or other 
organization was incorporated or organized in the United States, or (3) an act in furtherance 
of the offense was committed in the United States. See  18 U.S.C. § 1837. These 
extraterritorial provisions in the Act will provide the Justice Department with broad 
authority to prosecute the international theft of trade secrets and will prevent the willful 
evasion of liability for trade secret misappropriation by using the Internet or other means to 
transfer the trade secret information outside the United States. 
 
Moreover, the EEA authorizes the attorney general to commence a civil action seeking 
injunctive relief to prevent further disclosure of a trade secret by the defendant or third 
parties. See 18 U.S.C. § 1836. There is no requirement in  the Act that criminal indictments be 
issued first. Therefore, the Justice Department  may commence civil actions for injunctive 
relief at any stage of the investigation. In any prosecution or other proceeding under the Act, 
the Court is required to issue protective orders and to take such other action as be necessary 
to preserve the confidentiality of the trade secrets consistent with the Federal Rules of 
Criminal and Civil Procedure. See  18 U.S.C. § 1835. 
 
Finally, violations under the EEA may implicate other federal laws, including: 
• Disclosing government trade secrets (18 U.S.C. § 1905) 
• Interstate transportation and receipt of stolen property or goods (18 U.S.C. § 2314) 
• Mail or wire fraud (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343) 
• Computer Fraud (18 U.S.C. 1030(a)) 
• Criminal copyright infringement (17 U.S.C. § 506 and 18 U.S.C. § 2319) 
 
ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE (18 U.S.C. § 1831) 
Section 1831 of the EEA is targeted at economic espionage conducted by or on behalf of 
foreign governments or instrumentalities. In addition to the three general elements of an 
espionage case — that (1) the defendant stole or, with or without the authorization of the 
owner, obtained, destroyed, or conveyed information; (2) the defendant knew the 
information was proprietary; and (3) the information was in fact a trade secret) — there is a 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.323 
fourth element that the government must prove to successfully prosecute under section 
1831. The government must show that the defendant intended or knew that the offense 
would benefit a foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent. Attempts and 
conspiracies to commit these offenses are also punishable under section 1831.  
 
The maximum punishment under section 1831 is 15 years imprisonment and a fine of 
$500,000. If the offense is committed by an organization, the maximum fine is $10 million.  
 
THEFT OF TRADE SECRETS (18 U.S.C. § 1832) 
Section 1832 is concerned with conventional commercial theft and misappropriation of trade 
secrets. It principally covers domestic crimes. In addition to three standard elements of 
espionage, which were discussed above, a section 1832 action requires the government to 
prove the following three additional elements:  
• That the accused intended to convert the trade secret to the economic benefit of 
someone other than the rightful owner;  
• That the accused intended to injure the owner of the trade secret; and 
• That the trade secret was related to or included in a product that is produced for or 
placed in interstate or foreign commerce.  
 
As evidenced by the additional elements, the requirements for prosecution under section 
1832 are somewhat stricter than under section 1831. For example, section 1832 requires that 
the defendant have intended for someone to gain by the misappropriation, whereas section 
1831 prosecutions can succeed even when the benefits of a theft are noneconomic.  
 
The maximum punishments for an offense under section 1832 are 10 years imprisonment, a 
fine, or both. If the offense is committed by an organization, the fine can run as high as 
$5,000,000. Attempts and conspiracies to commit the domestic theft of trade secrets are also 
punishable under section 1832. 
   
ORDERS TO PRESERVE CONFIDENTIALITY (18 U.S.C. § 1835) 
Trade secret theft victims often feel conflicted about whether to report these crimes to the 
government. They want punishment but fear that their trade secrets will be disclosed during 
the trial process.  
 
Congress addressed this dilemma in section 1835, which gives the government procedures to 
preserve the confidentiality of trade secrets throughout the trial. Section 1835 authorizes the 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.324  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
court to enter orders and take actions “necessary and appropriate to preserve the 
confidentiality of trade secrets.” In addition, section 1835 gives the government the right to 
an interlocutory appeal from an order authorizing a trade secret’s disclosure. 
 
CONSTRUCTION WITH OTHER LAWS (18 U.S.C. § 1838) 
Section 1838 states that “[t]his chapter shall not be construed to preempt or displace any 
other remedies, whether civil or criminal, provided by United States Federal, State... or to 
affect the otherwise lawful disclosure of information by any government employees under 
section 552 of title 5 (commonly known as the Freedom of Information Act).” Therefore, 
the EEA does not bar the government from seeking any other remedies, whether civil or 
criminal.
