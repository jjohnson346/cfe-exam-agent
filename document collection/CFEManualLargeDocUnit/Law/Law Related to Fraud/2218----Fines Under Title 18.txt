Fines Under Title 18 
Several sections of Title 18 do not provide a specified maximum fine in the section setting 
forth the offense. Instead, these criminal statutes usually provide that the offender may “be 
fined under this title.” Unless a section sets fo rth another amount, the sections below should 
be used to determine the maximum sentence available. 
 
Sentence of Fine (18 U.S.C. § 3571) 
In general, the statutory provisions governing a sentence of a fine are set forth in section 
3571. It specifies the maximum fines that courts can impose against individuals and 
organizations. Section 3571 provides: 
 
(a) In general. — A defendant who has been found guilty of an offense may be sentenced to pay a 
fine. 
 
(b) Fines for individuals. — Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, an individual 
who has been found guilty of an offense may be fined not more than the greatest of — 
(1) The amount specified in the law setting forth the offense; 
(2) The applicable amount under subsection (d) of this section; 
 (3) For a felony, not more than $250,000; 
 (4) For a misdemeanor resulting in  death, not more than $250,000; 
 (5) For a Class A misdemeanor that does not result in death, not more than $100,000; 
(6) For a Class B or C misdemeanor that does not result in death, not more than $5,000; 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.335 
or 
(7) For an infraction, not more than $5,000. 
 
(c) Fines for organizations. — Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, an 
organization that has been found guilty of an offense may be fined not more than the 
greatest of — 
(1) The amount specified in the law setting forth the offense; 
(2) The applicable amount under subsection (d) of this section; 
(3) For a felony, not more than $500,000; 
(4) For a misdemeanor resulting in death, not more than $500,000; 
(5) For a Class A misdemeanor that does not result in death, not more than $200,000; 
(6) For a Class B or C misdemeanor that does not result in death, not more than 
$10,000; and 
(7) For an infraction, not more than $10,000. 
 
(d) Alternative fine based on gain or loss. — If any person derives pecuniary gain from the 
offense, or if the offense results in pecuniary loss to a person other than the defendant, the 
defendant may be fined not more than the greater of twice the gross gain or twice the gross 
loss, unless imposition of a fine under this subsection would unduly complicate or prolong 
the sentencing process. 
 
(e) Special rule for lower fine specified in substantive provis ion. — If a law setting forth an 
offense specifies no fine or a fine that is lower than the fine otherwise applicable under this 
section and such law, by specific reference, exempts the offense from the applicability of the 
fine otherwise applicable under this section, the defendant may not be fined more than the 
amount specified in the law setting forth the offense. 
 
Imposition of a Sentence of Fine and Related Matters (18 U.S.C. § 3572) 
Section 3572 sets forth the factors courts should consider in imposing fines. It provides: 
 
(a) Factors to be considered. — In determining whether to impose a fine, and the amount, time 
for payment, and method of payment of a fine, the court shall consider, in addition to the 
factors set forth in section 3553(a) — 
(1)  The defendant's income, earning capacity, and financial resources; 
(2)  The burden that the fine will impose upon the defendant, any person who is financially 
dependent on the defendant, or any other person (including a government) that would 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.336  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
be responsible for the welfare of any person financially dependent on the defendant, 
relative to the burden that alternative punishments would impose; 
(3)  Any pecuniary loss inflicted upon others as a result of the offense; 
(4)  Whether restitution is ordered or made and the amount of such restitution; 
(5)  The need to deprive the defendant of illegally obtained gains from the offense; 
(6) The expected costs to the government of any imprisonment, supervised release, or 
probation component of the sentence; 
(7) Whether the defendant can pass on to consumers or other persons the expense of the 
fine; and 
(8) If the defendant is an organization, the size of the organization and any measure taken 
by the organization to discipline any officer, director, employee, or agent of the 
organization responsible for the offense and to prevent a recurrence of such an offense. 
 
(b) Fine not to impair ability to make restitution. — If, as a result of a conviction, the defendant 
has the obligation to make restitution to a victim of the offense, the court shall impose a fine 
or other monetary penalty only to the extent that such fine or penalty will not impair the 
ability of the defendant to make restitution. 
 
(c)   Effect of finality of judgment. Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence to pay a fine can 
subsequently be — 
(1) Modified or remitted under section 3573; 
(2) Corrected under rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and section 3742; 
or 
(3) Appealed and modified under section 3742; 
a judgment that includes such a sentence is a final judgment for all other purposes 
 
(d)   Time, method of payment, and related items 
(1) A person sentenced to pay a fine or other monetary penalty, including restitution, shall 
make such payment immediately, unless, in the interest of justice, the court provides for 
payment on a date certain or in installments. If the court provides for payment in 
installments, the installments shall be in equal monthly payments over the period 
provided by the court, unless the court establishes another schedule. 
(2) If the judgment, or, in the case of a restitution order, the order, permits other than 
immediate payment, the length of time over which scheduled payments will be made 
shall be set by the court, but shall be the shortest time in which full payment can 
reasonably be made. 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.337 
(3) A judgment for a fine which permits payments in installments shall include a 
requirement that the defendant will notify the court of any material change in the 
defendant's economic circumstances that might affect the defendant’s ability to pay the 
fine. Upon receipt of such notice the court may, on its own motion or the motion of any 
party, adjust the payment schedule, or require immediate payment in full, as the 
interests of justice require. 
 
(e)   Alternative sentence precluded. At the time a defendant is sentenced to pay a fine, the court 
may not impose an alternative sentence to be carried out if the fine is not paid. 
(f)   Responsibility for payment of monetary obligation relating to organization. If a sentence 
includes a fine, special assessment, restitution or other monetary obligation (including 
interest) with respect to an organization, each individual authorized to make disbursements 
for the organization has a duty to pay the obligation from assets of the organization. If such 
an obligation is imposed on a director, officer, shareholder, employee, or agent of an 
organization, payments may not be made, di rectly or indirectly, from assets of the 
organization, unless the court finds that such payment is expressly permissible under 
applicable State law. 
 
(g)   Security for stayed fine. If a sentence imposing a fine is stayed, the court shall, absent 
exceptional circumstances (as determined by the court) - 
(1) Require the defendant to deposit, in the registry of the district court, any amount of the 
fine that is due; 
(2) Require the defendant to provide a bond or other security to ensure payment of the fine; 
or 
(3) Restrain the defendant from transferring or dissipating assets. 
 
 (h)  Delinquency. A fine or payment of restitut ion is delinquent if a payment is more than 30 
days late. 
 
(i)   Default. A fine or payment of restitution is in default if a payment is delinquent for more 
than 90 days. Notwithstanding any installment schedule, when a fine or payment of 
restitution is in default, the entire amount of the fine or restitution is due within 30 days 
after notification of the default, subject to the provisions of section 3613A. 
 
Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. § 3663A) 
The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA) expands the scope of mandatory 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.338  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
restitution on the federal level. It requires federal courts to order restitution for each 
defendant, without consideration of the defendant’s economic circumstances, who has been 
convicted or plead guilty to charges for certain categories of offenses, including fraud under 
Title 18, U.S. Code. Thus, victim corporations may be entitled to victim compensation, just 
like natural persons.  
 
Recently, courts have held that the MVRA third parties have the right to recover not only 
the losses suffered as a result of the wrongdoing, but also the costs associated with 
investigating the offense. Specifically, the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit agree that 
section 3663A(b)(4) of the MVRA provides for restitution of attorneys’ fees and certain out-of-pocket 
investigative expenses a victim company incurs as part of an internal investigation 
of suspected fraud.
