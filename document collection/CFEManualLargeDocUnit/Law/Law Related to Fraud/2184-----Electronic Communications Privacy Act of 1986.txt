Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986   
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA), codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 
2510–2521, 2701–2710, 3121–3126, governs the illegal interception of electronic 
communication and the unauthorized access of electronically stored data.  
 
The ECPA is divided into three parts: the Wiretap Act, which governs the interception of 
electronic communications; the Stored Communications Act, which covers access to stored 
communications and records; and the Pen Register Act, which regulates pen registers and 
trap and trace devices. This section focuses on the Wiretap Act and the Stored 
Communications Act. 
 
THE WIRETAP ACT (18 U.S.C. §§ 2510–2521) 
In response to an increase in privacy breaches, Congress enacted the Wiretap Act, which 
prohibits anyone from intentionally intercepting or attempting to intercept any wire, oral, or 
electronic communication. Under the ECPA, electronic communications are defined as “any 
transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature 
transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic, or photo 
optical system that affects interstate or foreign commerce.” 
 
Focusing on its applicability to computer fraud, section 2511 prohibits covert spying on

voice and data communications, extending protection from eavesdropping on mail and 
telephone communications to include digital data communications, such as e-mail and 
remote computing; it does not govern stored communications. But because most courts 
agree that interception does not occur when an individual obtains access to an electronically 
stored copy of the communication, the Wiretap Act is often inadequate to protect electronic 
communications sent over the Internet. For example, the Wiretap Act is often unsuccessful 
in combating spyware. Although spyware’s main function is to make unauthorized 
interceptions of electronic communication, spyware developers typically design spyware to 
evade the Wiretap Act’s reach by engineering the software to record electronic information 
while it is temporarily stored before, after, or during transmission.  
 
The Wiretap Act is discussed in more detail in the “Individual Rights” chapter below. 
 
THE STORED COMMUNICATIONS ACT (18 U.S.C. § 2701) 
As part of the ECPA, Congress enacted the Stored Communications Act (SCA) to protect 
stored electronic communications, such as e-mail and voicemail, by prohibiting the 
unauthorized access of such communications that are in storage. More specifically, the SCA 
prohibits unlawful access to a facility, which provides an electronic communication service, 
and, then, obtaining, altering, or preventing authorized access to a wire or electronic 
communication while it is electronically stored in such a system. An electronic 
communication falls under the SCA once a system receives and stores it.   
 
The SCA is discussed in more detail in the “Individual Rights” chapter below.
