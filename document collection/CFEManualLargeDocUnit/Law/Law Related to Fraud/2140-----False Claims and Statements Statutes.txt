False Claims and Statements Statutes  
As previously discussed, Chapter 47 of Title 18, U.S. Code contains a number of related 
provisions that punish false or fraudulent statements made to various federal agencies and 
departments, including 18 U.S.C. § 1001, the criminal false claims act (18 U.S.C. § 287), the 
civil false claims act (18 U.S.C. § 3729), and the Major Fraud Act of 1988 (18 U.S.C. § 1031). 
 
  
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.273 
FALSE STATEMENTS (18 U.S.C. § 1001) 
The principle federal false statement statute is located in section 1001 of Title 18, U.S. Code. 
Section 1001 prohibits false or fraudulent statements, orally or in writing, made to various 
federal agencies and departments.  
 
CRIMINAL FALSE CLAIMS ACT (18 U.S.C. § 287) 
Frequently referred to as the Criminal False Claims Act, section 287 makes it illegal to 
present or make any false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim against any agency or department of 
the United States. The crime is complete when the claim is presented and payment of the 
claim is not an element of the offense.  
 
CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT (31 U. S.C. § 3729 et seq.) 
The Civil False Claims Act is the civil counterpart to the Criminal False Claims Act. It 
provides a separate civil cause of action that may be taken in addition to a criminal 
prosecution. As a result, the submission of a false claim to the government can make a 
contractor liable to the government, both criminally and civilly. 
 
The False Claims Act provides in part that a person who commits the following acts is liable 
to the government for any treble damages it sustains and a civil penalty of $5,000 to $10,000 
per false claim. 
 
In addition to allowing the government to recover penalties and damages for false claims, 
the Civil False Claims Act allows a private party to prosecute a civil action against the 
perpetrator(s) on behalf of the government. This is called a qui tam action and is discussed 
in further detail below.  
 
MAJOR FRAUD ACT OF 1988 (18 U.S.C. § 1031) 
The Major Fraud Act prohibits any scheme to de fraud the United States or obtain money or 
property from the United States by means of false or fraudulent pretenses involving 
procurement contracts worth $1 million or more.  
 
To establish a claim under the Major Fraud Act, the government must show the following 
elements:  
• The defendant knowingly executed or attempted to execute 
• Any scheme or artifice  
• With the intent to defraud the United States or to obtain money by false pretenses 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.274  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• On a contract with the United States valued at $1 million or more 
 
The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA), signed into law by President 
Obama on May 20, 2009, contains a number of measures intended to combat fraud. Among 
other significant changes, FERA amends section 1031 to cover fraud in connection with 
funds provided under the Troubled Asset Relief Program and other governmental economic 
stimulus or recovery programs.  
 
If convicted, the defendant may be imprisoned for up to 10 years and fined up to $10 
million or twice the amount of the gross loss or gain involved in the offense. The statute 
contains a special seven-year statute of limitations compared to the normal five-year statute 
applicable to federal crimes. 
 
The statute also contains a whistleblower protection clause. This clause provides that any 
individual who is discharged, demoted, harassed, or otherwise mistreated as a result of the 
individual’s cooperation in the prosecution of offenses under this section may obtain 
reinstatement, two times the amount of back pay due, and other damages, including litigation 
costs and attorney’s fees. 
 
Another provision authorizes the attorney general to pay up to $250,000 in certain 
circumstances for information regarding possible prosecutions under this section. This and 
the whistleblower provisions do not apply to people who participated in the offense.
