THE LAW RELATED TO FRAUD (PART 1) 
 
Definition of Fraud 
Black’s Law Dictionary defines fraud as: 
 
… all multifarious means which human ingenuity can devise, and which are resorted to by one 
individual to get an advantage over another by false suggestions or suppression of the truth. It 
includes all surprise, trick, cunning or dissembling, and any unfair way by which another is 
cheated. 
  
Put more succinctly, fraud includes any intentional or deliberate act to deprive another of 
property or money by guile, deception, or other unfair means. 
 
The principal categories of fraud (or white-collar crime) are: 
• Misrepresentation of material facts 
• Concealment of material facts 
• Bribery 
• Extortion 
• Conflicts of interest 
• Forgery 
• Theft of money or property 
• Theft of trade secrets  
• Breach of fiduciary duty 
• Statutory offenses 
 
 
Principal Types of Fraud 
 
Misrepresentation of Material Facts 
Misrepresentation of material facts is most often thought of when the term fraud is used. 
Misrepresentation cases can be prosecuted criminally or civilly under a variety of statutes, 
such as false statements, false claims, or mail and wire fraud. They might also be the basis for 
common law claims. The gist of the offense is the deliberate making of false statements to 
induce the intended victim to part with money or property.  
 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.202  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
The specific elements composing proof of misrepresentation vary somewhat according to 
the jurisdiction and whether the case is prosecuted as a criminal or civil action. The elements 
normally include: 
• A material false statement  
• Knowledge of its falsity 
• Reliance on the false statement by the victim 
• Damages suffered 
 
Although it might be necessary to prove that the victim relied upon the false statements and 
actually suffered a loss in a civil case, these elements of proof might not be necessary in a 
criminal prosecution. In addition, in some statutes, materiality is assumed and need not be 
proved. 
 
In most instances, only false representations of “presently existing facts” may be prosecuted. 
Opinions or speculative statements about future events may not be the basis for a fraud case, 
even if made with the intent to mislead. A used car salesperson, for example, who assures 
the naive customer that the 20-year-old car towed to the lot will give him “years of driving 
pleasure” probably cannot be prosecuted for fraud. The salesperson could be prosecuted, 
however, if he tells the customer that the car has been driven only 15,000 miles when he 
knows that it has gone 150,000 miles. 
 
The rule limiting fraud cases to misrepresentations of existing facts is often applied to bar 
fraud claims in contract disputes. A party to a contract who promises to perform certain 
services by a particular date but fails to do so generally may not be prosecuted for fraud 
unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the defendant had the intent not to perform the 
promised services when the contract was made. Of course, the other party may file an action 
for breach of contract. 
 
The rule precluding fraud actions based on false “opinions” is subject to certain exceptions, 
principally cases involving opinions provided by professional advisers such as Certified 
Public Accountants. For example, an independent auditor may be liable for 
misrepresentation if he: 
• Certifies that a financial statement fairly presents the financial condition of the company 
when the auditor knows it does not, 
• Falsely states that the audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards, or 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.203 
• Deliberately distorts the audit results. 
 
Normally, only material false statements may serve as the basis for a fraud case. Materiality  
usually refers to statements sufficiently important or relevant to the defendant to influence 
the defendant’s decision. For example, a claim that a company enjoyed a 50 percent growth 
in profits would probably be material to a prospective investor, whereas a statement that the 
company was considering moving its headquarters from New York City to Chicago might 
not be. The materiality of allegedly false statements often is a central issue in security fraud 
cases.  
 
In all fraud cases, the prosecution or plaintiff must prove that a false statement was 
intentional and part of a deliberate scheme to defraud. A person intentionally makes a false 
statement if it is his desire to cause the social harm, or if he acts with knowledge that the 
social harm will almost certainly result from his actions. In some instances, particularly those 
involving civil actions for fraud and securities cases, the intent requirement is met if the 
prosecution or plaintiff is able to show that the false statements were made recklessly; that is, 
with complete disregard for truth or falsity. 
 
Moreover, there is no such thing as an accidental or negligent fraud. For exampale, 
mistakenly entering incorrect numbers on a financial statement is not fraud; however, 
knowingly entering incorrect numbers with the intent that someone will take action in 
reliance on them is fraud if the other elements are present. 
 
Although a misrepresentation fraud case may not be based on negligent or accidental 
misrepresentations, in some instances a civil action may be filed for negligent 
misrepresentation. This action is appropriate if a defendant suffered a loss because of the 
carelessness or negligence of another party upon which the defendant was entitled to rely. 
Examples would be negligent false statements to a prospective purchaser regarding the value 
of a closely held company’s stock or the accuracy of its financial statements. 
 
Concealment of Material Facts 
An action for fraud may be based on the concealment of material facts, but only if the 
defendant had a duty in the circumstances to disclose. The essential elements of fraud based 
on failure to disclose material facts are: 
• That the defendant had knowledge 
• Of a material fact 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.204  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• That the defendant had a duty to disclose 
• And failed to do so 
• With the intent to mislead or deceive the other party 
 
The duty to disclose usually depends on the relationship between the parties. Those people 
who occupy a special relationship of trust, such as the officers or directors of a corporation, 
an attorney, accountant, trustee, stockbroker, or other agent, may be found to have a duty to 
completely disclose material facts to the parties who rely upon them. Statutes might expand 
the duty to disclose to areas in which traditionally there was no such duty, such as to the 
sellers of personal or real property or to the purchasers or sellers of securities. 
 
Proof that the concealed fact was material probably is the most important element in a 
concealment case; there can be no liability if  the withheld information would not have 
affected the other party. In addition to fraudulent concealment, a defendant might also be 
liable for negligent failure to discover and disclose material facts. An accountant, for 
example, might be liable for failure to discover or report material facts in a financial 
statement or audit. Of course, as with neg ligent misrepresentation, the penalties are less 
severe for negligence than fraudulent misrepresentation, and there is no criminal liability. 
 
Bribery 
Bribery is a form of corruption that may be defined as the offering, giving, receiving, or 
soliciting of anything of value to influence an act or a decision.  
 
Types of Bribery Schemes 
Bribery includes official bribery and commercial bribery.  
 
OFFICIAL BRIBERY 
Official bribery  refers to the corruption of a public official. Illegal payments to public officials 
can give rise to stiff criminal penalties. The elements of official bribery vary by jurisdiction 
but generally are: 
• Giving or receiving 
• A thing of value 
• With the intent to corruptly influence 
• An official act 
 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.205 
COMMERCIAL BRIBERY 
In contrast, commercial bribery refers to the corruption of a private individual to gain a 
commercial or business advantage. Commercial bribery may be prosecuted either as a criminal 
act or by a civil action. About half of the states in the U.S. have criminal statutes that 
prohibit commercial bribery. If a state does not have a commercial bribery statute, 
commercial bribery schemes can usually be prosecuted under criminal fraud statutes on the 
theory that the payment of a commercial bribe defrauds the business owner of the right to 
an employee’s unbiased and loyal services. 
 
There is no federal statute prohibiting commercial bribery, but such offenses may be 
prosecuted at the federal level as mail or wire fraud, as a RICO violation, or as a violation of 
some other law. The elements of commercial bribery vary by jurisdiction, but typically 
include: 
• Giving or receiving 
• A thing of value 
• With intent to corruptly influence 
• A business decision 
• Without the knowledge or consent of the principal 
 
The “without the knowledge or consent of the principal” element is included on the theory 
that a private business owner is not defrauded if the owner knows of or allows employees to 
accept gifts, favors, or other payments from vendors or other business contacts. 
 
Most state commercial bribery statutes are misdemeanors punishable by a jail term of no 
more than one year. Commercial bribery is a felony in Colorado, Kansas, Texas, Arizona (if 
the value of the bribe payment is $100 or more) and New Hampshire (if the value of the 
bribe is $500 or more). The New York commercial bribery law is a typical statute that makes 
it a misdemeanor to give or receive (or to offer or solicit) “any benefit” without the consent 
of the employer, with the intent of influencing the employee’s business conduct. The 
Louisiana, Michigan, and New Jersey commercial bribery statutes confer immunity on the 
party to the scheme who first agrees to testify against the other party in a criminal 
proceeding. 
 
Businesses injured by commercial bribery schemes may sue for treble damages and attorneys’ 
fees under the Civil RICO statute (Title 18 U.S. Code Section 1964) and the Clayton 
Antitrust Act (Title 15 U.S. Code Section 13(c)), and for compensatory and punitive 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.206  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
damages for common law fraud, conflict of interest, and breach of fiduciary duty. Civil 
actions may be brought even if commercial bribery is not a crime in a jurisdiction. 
 
Methods of Making Corrupt Payments 
In bribery schemes, the thing of value  is not limited to cash or money. Any tangible benefit 
given or received with the intent to corruptly influence the recipient may be an illegal 
payment. Courts have held that such things as lavish gifts and entertainment, payment of 
travel and lodging expenses, payment of credit card bills, loans, promises of future 
employment, and interests in businesses, can be bribes if they were given or received with 
the intent to influence or be influenced. Some state statutes might distinguish between 
felonies or misdemeanors according to the amount of illegal payment. 
 
Corrupt Influence 
To establish a bribery claim, it must be proven that the defendant acted with Proof of corrupt 
influence often involves demonstration that the person receiving the bribe favored the bribe-
 payer in some improper or unusual way, such as by providing preferential treatment, bending 
or breaking the rules, taking extraordinary steps to assist the bribe-payer, or allowing the 
bribe-payer to defraud the agency or company. It is not necessary, however, that the 
prosecution or plaintiff demonstrate that the bribe-taker acted improperly; a bribe might be 
paid to induce an official to perform an act that otherwise would be legal, or an act that the 
official might have performed without a bribe. Bribery schemes involving these 
circumstances, however, are difficult to prove and lack appeal for prosecution. 
 
Illegal Gratuity 
Illegal gratuities are similar to bribery schemes. In fact, under the federal legislation governing 
the offenses of bribery and illegal gratuity (Title 18 U.S. Code Section 201), an illegal gratuity 
is a lesser-included offense of official bribery. The elements of an illegal gratuity are:  
• Giving or receiving 
• A thing of value 
• For or because of 
• An official act 
 
The big difference between a bribe and an illegal gratuity is that an illegal gratuity charge 
does not require proof that the gratuity was given for the purpose of influencing an official 
act. In other words, an illegal gratuity charge only requires that the gratuity be given for or 
because of an official act.  
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.207 
In the typical illegal gratuities scenario, a decision is made which happens to benefit a certain 
person or company. The party who benefited from the decision then gives a gift to the 
person who made the decision. The gifts are merely offered as a “thank you” for something 
that has been done. 
 
The federal statute governing the illegal gratuity offense prohibits a public official from 
accepting any payment of money or thing of value other than his lawful compensation. In 
practice, the statute often is applied when relatively small payments, such as gifts or 
entertainment, are used to attempt to influence a public official. 
 
Extortion 
An extortion case is often the flip side of a bribery case. Extortion is defined as the obtaining 
of property from another with the other party’s “consent” having been induced by wrongful 
use of actual or threatened force or fear. Fear might include the apprehension of possible 
economic damage or loss. A demand for a bribe or kickback, coupled with a threat of 
adverse action if the payment is not paid, also might constitute extortion. 
 
In most states and the federal system, extortion is not a defense to bribery. That is, a person 
who makes a bribe payment upon demand of the recipient still is culpable for bribery. In 
New York, however, extortion may be a defense in certain circumstances. 
 
Conflict of Interest 
A conflict of interest occurs when an employee has an undisclosed personal or economic 
interest in a transaction. These schemes involve self-dealing by an employee and can occur in 
various ways. A conflict may occur when an employee accepts inappropriate gifts, favors, or 
kickbacks from vendors, or when an employee engages in unapproved employment 
discussions with current or prospective contractors or suppliers. 
 
Statutes in every state and the federal system (as well as common law decisions in all 
jurisdictions) prohibit people from engaging in conduct that involves a conflict of interest. A 
conflict of interest may be prosecuted civilly or criminally. The criminal statutes vary widely 
and include prohibitions on public officers from accepting employment with government 
contractors or lobbying government agencies during specified times. 
 
Elements of a typical civil claim for conflict of interest include: 
• An agent taking an interest in a transaction 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.208  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• That is actually or potentially adverse to the principal 
• Without full and timely disclosure to and approval by the principal 
 
An agent includes any person who, under the law, owes a duty of loyalty to another, including 
officers, directors, and employees of a corporation, public officials, trustees, brokers, 
independent contractors, attorneys, and accountants. People who do not occupy positions of 
trust with another party, such as arms-length commercial parties, do not owe a duty of 
loyalty to each other and therefore are not subject to conflict of interest restrictions. 
 
The defendant in a civil conflict of interest case must repay any losses that the conflict 
caused and “disgorge” any profits he earned because of the conflict, even if there was no 
actual loss to the principal. The “disloyal” party also might be required to forfeit all 
compensation received during the period of disloyalty. The victim of a conflict of interest 
also may void any contracts entered into on its behalf that were the result of or influenced by 
the conflict. 
 
Forgery 
Forgery includes two distinct common law offenses: forgery and uttering a forged 
instrument. Both crimes are specific intent offenses, i.e., they both require proof of specific 
intent to defraud. 
 
Forgery is: 
• The fraudulent making or altering 
• Of a false writing or instrument that has apparent legal significance 
• With the intent to defraud 
 
Uttering a forged instrument expands the forgery offense by including the offering or 
passing of a forged document as genuine. The elements of uttering a forged instrument are: 
• Offering as genuine 
• A forged instrument 
• With the intent to defraud 
 
A forgery occurs when a document is not what it purports to be. It is not forgery just 
because the writing contains a false representation. The writing as a whole must have 
apparent legal significance. Forgery occurs not just when an entire writing or instrument is 
created, but also when there is any material alteration that affects the legal significance of the 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.209 
document and/or whenever a signature on a writing is fraudulently procured from a person 
who does not know what he is signing. Furthermore, the offense is committed even if no 
one is actually defrauded. 
 
Although forgery is a crime, not a civil wrong, it can occur in connection with a fraud or a 
conversion of property or property interests, for which the victim can seek civil remedies. 
 
Theft of Money and Property 
Theft is a term often used to describe a wide variety of fraudulent conduct. Many state 
statutes describe misrepresentation fraud as theft by deception or larceny by trick. As used here, 
the term theft is limited to embezzlement, larceny, and misappropriation of trade secrets and 
proprietary information. 
 
Embezzlement 
Embezzlement is the wrongful appropriation of money or property by a person to whom it has 
been lawfully entrusted (or to whom lawful possession was given). Embezzlement involves a 
breach of trust, although it is not necessary to show a fiduciary relationship between the 
parties. The elements of embezzlement are generally: 
• The defendant took or converted 
• Without the knowledge or consent of the owner 
• Money or property of another 
• That was entrusted to the defendant (defendant had lawful possession of the property) 
 
Larceny 
Larceny is defined as the unlawful taking of money or property of another with the intent to 
convert or to deprive the owner. Unlike in embezzlement, in larceny the defendant never has 
lawful possession of the property, but may have mere custody of it (e.g., a cashier has 
custody, not possession, of money in a register). The elements of larceny typically include: 
• Unlawfully taking or carrying away 
• Money or property of another 
• Without the consent of the owner 
• With the intent to permanently deprive the owner of its use or possession 
 
Misappropriation of Trade Secrets 
Misappropriation is the intentional, illegal use of the property, funds, or ideas of another 
person for an unauthorized purpose. In the fraud context, misappropriation claims generally 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.210  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
involve trade secrets or other proprietary information. 
 
Trade secret includes not only secret formulas and processes, but also more mundane 
proprietary information, such as customer and price lists, sales figures, business plans, or any 
other confidential information that has a value to the business and would be potentially 
harmful if disclosed. 
 
Theft or misappropriation of trade secrets may be prosecuted under a variety of federal and 
state statutes and the common law. The definition of what constitutes a trade secret depends 
on the organization, industry, and jurisdiction, but the following three characteristics are 
common to most definitions: 
• The information is not generally known to the relevant portion of the public. 
• It confers some sort of economic benefit on its holder (where this benefit must derive 
specifically from its not being generally known, not just from the value of the 
information itself). 
• It is the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. 
 
The elements of a typical theft of trade secret claim are: 
• That a party possessed information of value to the business 
• The information was treated confidentially 
• That the defendant took or used the information by breach of an agreement, confidential 
relationship, or other improper means 
 
An organization can only maintain legal protection over its trade secrets if it takes reasonable 
steps to keep that information secret. Thus, it is critical that the information being sought to 
be protected was treated confidentially, although absolute secrecy is not required; it is 
sufficient if the information was “substantially” undisclosed. Limited disclosure to people 
with a need to know or pursuant to confidentiality agreements will not void the secret. 
Methods of demonstrating that information was intended to be kept confidential include a 
written policy describing the information as proprietary or secret; strict limitations on 
distribution of the information; and physically securing the information to prevent 
unauthorized access and use. 
 
The owners of the information also should enforce restrictive agreements and act promptly 
to remedy any inadvertent disclosures. Failure to do so might be construed as a waiver of 
confidentiality and make it impossible to prevent future use or disclosures. 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.211 
COMMON DEFENSE IN TRADE SECRET CASES 
The most typical defense is that the information was developed independently. If the 
aggrieved party demonstrates that the information came to the defendant as the result of or 
during a confidential relationship, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to 
demonstrate independent discovery. The defendant also might defend a misappropriation 
claim by showing that the information was not in fact a secret, that the third party’s use was 
authorized, or that the trade secret or proprietary information had been abandoned by the 
owner. 
 
CIVIL ACTION FOR TRADE SECRET THEFT 
A victim of theft of trade secrets may file a civil action for damages or request an injunction 
under a variety of federal and state statutes. Civil damages include reimbursement for actual 
losses caused by the defendant, such as lost profits, reimbursement of development expenses 
and overhead costs, and the cost of efforts to protect the secret or recover damages, as well 
as for reduction in the value of business. Damages also can be measured by the defendant’s 
profits, which may be ordered to be paid to the plaintiff. Punitive damages and attorney’s 
fees also may be awarded. 
 
In addition to or in lieu of monetary damages, the plaintiff in a civil action for theft of trade 
secrets also may obtain an injunction prohibiting further use of the information. To obtain 
an injunction, the plaintiff must demonstrate that: 
• It is the proper owner of the trade secret 
• An unauthorized person has taken or used the trade secret 
• There is a high probability of improper disclosure 
• The plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury (meaning that the plaintiff could not be 
adequately compensated by monetary damages) 
• The plaintiff probably will win the case 
 
Injunctions have been issued in numerous trade secret cases to prevent the use of stolen 
information, to prohibit an employee in possession of a trade secret from accepting 
employment with a competitor, or to order the wrongdoer to return the misappropriated 
information. The injunction usually prohibits use of the trade secret only for that period it 
would have been required for its legitimate independent development. However, injunctions 
are difficult to obtain. 
 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.212  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Breach of Contract 
If the fraudster has any kind of a contractual relationship with the victim, there may also be a 
breach of contract claim. Any non-performance of a contractual obligation or an announcement 
that a party cannot or will not perform constitutes a breach. In other words, a breach of 
contract occurs when one party fails to perform, or announces that it does not intend to 
perform, without just cause.  
 
A breach of contract claim can arise under an oral or written contract. Many states have 
recognized certain implied or unwritten duties as a part of almost every contract. For 
instance, some courts have held that it is an implicit part of a contract that each party will 
use their best efforts to fulfill their duties under the contract. A similar duty that has been 
recognized by some states is the duty to deal with each other in good faith. If a party to a 
contract, which includes an employment contract, steals from the other party or acts in bad 
faith, there may be a civil claim for breach of contract. 
 
Gross Negligence 
Gross negligence can be generally defined as the intentional failure to perform a duty in reckless 
disregard of the consequences to the victim. Although the exact definition varies by state, 
the basic elements of this civil cause of action are that the defendant committed an 
intentional act, knowing that it was at least substantially likely to cause harm to the victim. In 
regards to an employee, the employee has a duty to act in the best interests of the employer. 
If the employee consciously steals from the employer, the employee has breached that duty 
and caused harm to the employer; further, the employee knew that the harm would occur 
when he committed the act. One further note about gross negligence — generally, punitive or 
exemplary damages are available if the defendant is found liable. 
 
Breach of Fiduciary Duty 
People in a position of trust or fiduciary relationship — such as officers, directors, high-level 
employees of a corporation or business, and agents and brokers — owe certain duties 
imposed by law to their principals or employers. The principal fiduciary duties are loyalty 
and care. 
 
Duty of Loyalty 
The duty of loyalty requires that the employee/agent act solely in the best interest of the 
employer/principal, free of any self-dealing, conflicts of interest, or other abuse of the 
principal for personal advantage. Thus, corporate directors, officers, and employees are 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.213 
barred from using corporate property or assets for their personal pursuits or taking 
corporate opportunities for themselves. More traditional forms of fraudulent conduct, such 
as embezzlements, thefts, acceptance of kickbacks, and conflicts of interest, also violate the 
duty of loyalty and may be prosecuted as such in addition to or instead of the underlying 
offense. 
 
A breach of duty of loyalty is easier to prove than fraud. The plaintiff does not need to 
prove criminal or fraudulent intent or the other elements of fraud. To prevail, the plaintiff 
must show only that the defendant occupied a position of trust or fiduciary relationship as 
described above, and that the defendant breached that duty to benefit personally. 
 
Duty of Care 
A corporate officer, director, or high-level employee, as well as other people in a fiduciary 
relationship, must conduct business affairs prudently with the skill and attention normally 
exercised by people in similar positions. Fiduciaries who act carelessly or recklessly are 
responsible for any resulting loss to the corporate shareholders or other principals. Damages 
may be recovered in a civil action for negligence, mismanagement, or waste of corporate 
assets. 
 
People in a fiduciary relationship, however, are not guarantors against all business reverses or 
errors in judgment. The business judgment rule protects corporate officers and directors from 
liability for judgments that were made in good faith (e.g., free of self-dealings or conflicts) 
and that appeared to be prudent based on the then-known circumstances. 
 
Corporate officers breach their duty of loyalty if they accept kickbacks, engage in a conflict 
of interest, or are otherwise disloyal. However, corporate officers who carelessly fail to 
prevent such conduct, enforce controls, or pursue recovery of losses might breach their duty 
of care. Corporate defendants in such cases might raise the business judgment rule in 
defense by showing that they had no reasonable grounds to suspect such conduct or that the 
cost of prevention or recovery was too high compared to the anticipated returns. 
 
Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claim 
A breach of fiduciary duty claim is a civil action. The plaintiff may receive damages for lost 
profits and recover profits that the disloyal employee earned—in some instances even the 
salary paid to the employee or agent during the period of disloyalty. The plaintiff may 
recover profits earned by the disloyal agent even if the principal did not suffer an actual loss. 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.214  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
The plaintiff also may void any contracts entered into on its behalf that were the result of or 
were influenced by the employee or agent’s disloyalty. 
 
 
Federal Legislation Related to Fraud 
Under our federal system, the prosecution of most white-collar crimes, such as 
embezzlement, larceny, and false pretenses, is left to the states. Prosecution under the 
criminal fraud statutes in the U.S. Code requires a federal jurisdictional basis, such as an 
effect on interstate commerce or mail uses. The U.S. laws often are used to prosecute the 
larger and more serious crimes primarily because of the generally superior resources of 
federal law enforcement agencies and their nationwide jurisdiction. 
 
All federal criminal laws are the product of statutes. Statutes vary widely from a statute that 
prohibits unauthorized use of the “Smoky the Bear” emblem to the criminal provisions of 
the antitrust laws. The most important of the hundreds of federal laws, rules, and regulations 
are listed below. 
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Public Law 107-204) 
On July 30, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This law, which 
was triggered in large part by several corporate accounting scandals that occurred in 2001 
and 2002, significantly changed the laws of corporate governance and the rules and 
regulations under which accounting firms must operate. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was 
designed to restore investor confidence in capital markets and help eliminate financial 
statement fraud in publicly traded companies while at the same time significantly increasing 
the penalties for corporate accounting fraud. The most significant changes brought on by 
the Act included:  
• The creation of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
• Requirements for senior financial officers to certify SEC filings 
• New standards for audit committee independence 
• New standards for auditor independence 
• Enhanced financial disclosure requirements 
• New protections for corporate whistleblowers 
• Enhanced penalties for white-collar crime 
 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 101 establishes the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.215 
(PCAOB), whose purpose is: 
 
[T]o oversee the audit of public companies that are subject to the securities laws, and related matters, in 
order to protect the interests of investors and further the public interest in the preparation of informative, 
accurate, and independent audit reports for companies the securities of which are sold to, and held by and 
for, public investors. 
 
In short, the PCAOB is charged with overseeing public company audits, setting audit 
standards, and investigating acts of noncompliance by auditors or audit firms. The PCAOB 
is to be appointed and overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which 
is part of the Executive branch. It is to be made up of five persons, two who are or have 
been CPAs and three who have never been CPAs. The PCAOB members, which are 
appointed by the SEC, can only be removed by the SEC for cause. 
 
The Act lists the PCAOB’s duties, which include: 
• Registering public accounting firms that audit publicly traded companies 
• Establishing or adopting auditing, quality control, ethics, independence, and other 
standards relating to audits of publicly traded companies 
• Inspecting registered public accounting firms 
• Investigating registered public accounting firms and their employees, conducting 
disciplinary hearings, and imposing sanctions where justified 
• Performing such other duties as are necessary to promote high professional standards 
among registered accounting firms, to improve the quality of audit services offered by 
those firms, and to protect investors 
• Enforcing compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the rules of the PCAOB, 
professional standards, and securities laws relating to public company audits 
 
Recently, the Supreme Court considered a constitutional challenge to the PCAOB in Free 
Enterprise Fund v. Public Comp any Accounting Oversight Board, et al. In this case, the Free 
Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit public interest organization, and a Nevada accounting firm 
sued the PCAOB seeking an order that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act violates the U.S. 
Constitution.  
 
The main issue raised by the suit concerned whether SOX violated the separation of powers 
doctrine by the manner in which the PCAOB’s members are selected and removed. To 
review, the separation of powers doctrine precludes each of the three branches of 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.216  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
government (legislative, executive, and judicial) from interfering upon the domain of the 
other two branches. In particular, the plaintiffs argued that SOX is unconstitutional because 
the PCAOB’s members are impermissibly insulated from presidential oversight, noting that 
the members are appointed by, and can only be removed for cause by, the SEC and not the 
president. 
 
In its opinion, the Supreme Court ruled that, because the President lacks the power to fire 
the Board members, the current method for removing PCAOB members violated the 
separation of powers principles. The Court detailed that the “buck stops” with the President, 
and, therefore, a clear and effective chain of command must be in place. “By granting the 
Board executive power without the Executive’s oversight [SOX] subverts the President’s 
ability to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed — as well as the public’s ability to pass 
judgment on his efforts. The Act’s restrictions are incompatible with the Constitution’s 
separation of powers…. Congress cannot limit the President’s authority in this way.”  
 
Despite ruling that the provision violated the Constitution, the Court allowed SOX to 
remain “fully operative as a law.” It also said that, to bring the PCAOB into compliance with 
the Constitution, the SEC must be given the ability to remove the Board members at will. 
Thus, PCAOB may continue to function without any for operational changes or legislative 
action. 
 
REGISTRATION WITH THE BOARD 
Public accounting firms must be registered with the PCAOB to legally prepare or issue an 
audit report on a publicly traded company. To become registered, accounting firms must 
disclose, among other things, the names of all public companies they audited in the 
preceding year, the names of all public companies they expect to audit in the current year, 
and the annual fees they received from each of their public audit clients for audit, 
accounting, and non-audit services.  
 
AUDITING, QUALITY CONTROL, AND INDEPENDENCE STANDARDS AND RULES 
Section 103 of the Act requires the PCAOB to establish standards for auditing, quality 
control, ethics, independence, and other issues relating to audits of publicly traded 
companies. Although the Act places the responsibility on the PCAOB to establish audit 
standards, it also sets forth certain rules that the PCAOB is required to include in those 
auditing standards. Among these rules are:  
• Audit work papers must be maintained for at least seven years. 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.217 
• Auditing firms must include a concurring or second partner review and approval of audit 
reports, as well as concurring approval in the issuance of the audit report by a qualified 
person other than the person in charge of the audit. 
• All audit reports must describe the scope of testing of the company’s internal control 
structure and present the auditor’s findings from the testing, including an evaluation of 
whether the internal control structure is acceptable and a description of material 
weaknesses in internal controls and any material noncompliance with controls. 
 
Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the PCAOB, in conjunction with the 
Security Exchange Commission (SEC), has promulgated several rules requiring compliance 
with additional auditing standards. Because these rules are extensive and ever-changing, 
auditors should periodically review the SEC’s website for updates and new rules at 
http://sec.gov/rules/final.shtml.  
 
INSPECTIONS OF REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMS 
The Act also authorizes the PCAOB to conduct regular inspections of public accounting 
firms to assess their degree of compliance with laws, rules, and professional standards 
regarding audits. Inspections are to be conducted once a year for firms that regularly audit 
more than 100 public companies and at least once every three years for firms that regularly 
audit 100 or fewer public companies.  
 
INVESTIGATIONS AND DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS 
The PCAOB has the authority to investigate registered public accounting firms (or their 
employees) for potential violations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, professional standards, any 
rules established by the board, or any securities laws relating to the preparation and issuance 
of audit reports. During an investigation, the PCAOB has the power to compel testimony 
and document production.  
 
Additionally, the PCAOB has the power to issue sanctions for violations or for 
noncooperation with an investigation. Sanctions can include temporary or permanent 
suspension of a firm’s registration with the board (which would mean that firm could no 
longer legally audit publicly traded companies), temporary or permanent suspension of a 
person’s right to be associated with a registered public accounting firm, prohibition from 
auditing public companies, and civil monetary penalties of up to $750,000 for an individual 
and up to $15,000,000 for a firm.  
 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.218  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Certification Obligations for CEOs and CFOs 
One of the most significant changes affected by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is the requirement 
that the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of public 
companies personally certify annual and quarterly SEC filings. These certifications essentially 
require CEOs and CFOs to take responsibility for their companies’ financial statements and 
prevent them from delegating this responsibility to their subordinates and then claiming 
ignorance when fraud is uncovered in the financial statements.  
 
There are two types of officer certifications mandated by Sarbanes-Oxley: criminal 
certifications, which are set forth in Sarbanes-Oxley section 906 and codified at 18 U.S.C. § 
1350, and civil certifications, which are set forth in Sarbanes-Oxley section 302. 
 
CRIMINAL CERTIFICATIONS (SARBANES-OXLEY § 906) 
Under Section 906, all periodic filings with the SEC must be accompanied by a statement, 
signed by the CEO and CFO, which certifies that the report fully complies with the SEC’s 
periodic reporting requirements and that the information in the report fairly presents, in all 
material respects, the financial condition and results of operation of the company. 
 
These certifications are known as “criminal certifications” because the Act imposes criminal 
penalties on officers who violate the certification requirements.  
• Corporate officers who knowingly  violate the certification requirements are subject to 
fines of up to $1,000,000 and up to 10 years imprisonment, or both.  
• Corporate officers who willfully violate the certification requirements are subject to fines 
of up to $5,000,000 and up to 20 years imprisonment, or both.  
 
CIVIL CERTIFICATIONS (SARBANES-OXLEY § 302) 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 302 requires the CEO and CFO to personally certify the following 
six items in every annual and quarterly report:  
1. They have personally reviewed the report. 
2. Based on their knowledge, the report does not contain any material misstatement that 
would render the financials misleading. 
3. Based on their knowledge, the financial information in the report fairly presents in all 
material respects the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow of the 
company. 
4. They are responsible for designing, maintaining, and evaluating the company’s internal 
controls; they have evaluated the controls within 90 days prior to the report; and they 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.219 
have presented their conclusions about the effectiveness of those controls in the report. 
5. They have disclosed to the auditors and the audit committee any material weaknesses in 
the controls and any fraud, whether material or not, that involves management or other 
employees who have a significant role in the company’s internal controls. 
6. They have indicated in their report whether there have been significant changes in the 
company’s internal controls since the filing of the last report. 
 
Note that in items two and three, the CEO and CFO are not required to certify that the 
financials are accurate or that there is no misstatement. They are simply required to certify 
that to their knowledge the financials are accurate and not misleading. This does not mean, 
however, that senior financial officers can simply plead ignorance about their companies’ 
SEC filings to avoid liability.  
 
Furthermore, the term fairly presents in item three is a broader standard than what is required 
by GAAP. In certifying that their SEC filings meet this standard, the CEO and CFO 
essentially must certify that the company (1) has selected appropriate accounting policies to 
ensure the material accuracy of the reports; (2) has properly applied those accounting 
standards; and (3) has disclosed financial information that reflects the underlying 
transactions and events of the company. Furthermore, the other certification rules (see items 
one, four, five, and six above) mandate that CEOs  and CFOs take an active role in their 
companies’ public reporting and in the design and maintenance of internal controls. 
 
Also, it is significant that in item four, the CEO and CFO not only have to certify that they 
are responsible for their companies’ internal controls, but also that they have evaluated the 
controls within 90 days prior to their quarterly or annual report.  Essentially, this certification 
requirement mandates that companies actively and continually re-evaluate their control 
structures to prevent fraud. 
 
In conjunction with the Sarbanes-Oxley section 302 certification requirements on the 
responsibility of the CEO and CFO for internal controls, Sarbanes-Oxley section 404 
requires all annual reports to contain an internal control report that (1) states management’s 
responsibility for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and 
procedures for financial reporting; and (2) contains an assessment of the effectiveness of the 
internal control structure and procedures of the company for financial reporting.  
 
Item five requires the CEO and CFO to certify that they have disclosed to their auditors and 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.220  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
their audit committee any material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls, and any 
fraud, whether material or not, that involves management or other key employees. Obviously, 
this is a very broad reporting standard that goes beyond the “material” standard 
contemplated in auditing standards. The CEO and CFO now must report to their auditors 
and audit committee any fraud committed by a manager. This places a greater burden on the 
CEO and CFO to take part in anti-fraud efforts and to be aware of fraudulent activity within 
their companies to meet this certification requirement.  
 
Item six is significant because periodic SEC filings must now include statements detailing 
significant changes to the internal controls of publicly traded companies. 
 
The overall effect of these certification requirements is to force CEOs and CFOs to take an 
active role in the anti-fraud efforts of their companies, making internal controls and fraud 
prevention a high priority. 
 
Standards for Audit Committee Independence 
AUDIT COMMITTEE RESPONSIBILITIES  
Section 301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act makes the audit committee for each publicly traded 
company “directly responsible” for appointing, compensating, and overseeing the work of 
the company’s outside auditors. The Act also mandates that the auditors must report directly 
to the audit committee — not management — and makes it the responsibility of the audit 
committee to resolve disputes between management and the auditors. Section 301 also 
requires that the audit committee must have the authority and funding to hire independent 
counsel and any other advisors it deems necessary to carry out its duties.  
 
COMPOSITION OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandates that each member of a company’s audit committee must 
be a member of its board of directors and must otherwise be “independent.” The term 
“independent” means that the audit committee members can only receive compensation 
from the company for their service on the board of directors, the audit committee, or 
another committee of the board of directors. They cannot be paid by the company for any 
other consulting or advisory work.  
 
FINANCIAL EXPERT  
Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires every public company to disclose in its 
periodic reports to the SEC whether or not the audit committee has at least one member 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.221 
who is a “financial expert,” and if not, to explain the reasons why. The Act defines a 
“financial expert” as a person who, through education and experience as a public accountant, 
auditor, CFO, comptroller, chief accounting officer, or a similar position, (1) has an 
understanding of generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements; (2) has 
experience in preparing or auditing financial statements of comparable companies and the 
application of such principles in accounting for estimates, accruals, and reserves; (3) has 
experience with internal controls; and (4) has an understanding of audit committee 
functions.  
 
ESTABLISHING A WHISTLEBLOWING STRUCTURE 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act makes it the responsibility of the audit committee to establish 
procedures (e.g., a hotline) for receiving and dealing with complaints and anonymous 
employee tips regarding irregularities in the company’s accounting methods, internal 
controls, or auditing matters.  
 
Standards for Auditor Independence 
RESTRICTIONS ON NON-AUDIT ACTIVITY 
Perhaps the greatest concern arising out of the public accounting scandals of 2001 and 2002 
was the fear that public accounting firms that received multimillion-dollar consulting fees 
from their public company clients could not maintain an appropriate level of objectivity in 
conducting audits for those clients. To address this concern, Congress established section 
201, which provides a list of activities that public accounting firms are now prohibited from 
performing on behalf of their audit clients. The prohibited services include:  
• Bookkeeping services 
• Financial information systems design and implementation 
• Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contribution-in-kind reports 
• Actuarial services 
• Internal audit outsource services 
• Management functions or human resources 
• Broker or dealer, investment adviser, or investment banking services 
• Legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit 
• Any other service that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board proscribes 
 
There are certain other non-audit services — most notably tax services — that are not 
expressly prohibited by Sarbanes-Oxley. In order for a public accounting firm to perform 
these services on behalf of an audit client, however, that service must be approved in 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.222  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
advance by the client’s audit committee, which must be disclosed in the client’s periodic SEC 
reports. Furthermore, regarding non-audit services, the SEC prevents accounts from 
providing audit clients with expert opinions and services, as well as legal representation for 
advocating the audit client’s litigation, regulatory, or administrative interests. 
 
MANDATORY AUDIT PARTNER ROTATION 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 204 requires public accounting firms to rotate the lead audit partner 
or the partner responsible for reviewing the audit every five years.  
 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROVISIONS 
Another provision of Sarbanes-Oxley aimed at improving auditor independence is section 
206, which seeks to limit conflicts or potential conflicts that arise when auditors cross over 
to work for their former clients. The Act now makes it unlawful for a public accounting firm 
to audit a company if, within the prior year, the client’s CEO, CFO, controller, or chief 
accounting officer worked for the accounting firm and participated in the company’s audit.  
 
AUDITOR REPORTS TO AUDIT COMMITTEES 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 301 requires that auditors report directly to the audit committee, and 
section 204 makes certain requirements as to the contents of those reports. To help ensure 
that the audit committee is aware of questionable accounting policies or treatments that were 
used in the preparation of the company’s financial statements, Sarbanes-Oxley section 204 
states that auditors must make a timely report (before any report is filed with the SEC 
pursuant to the federal securities laws) of the following to the audit committee:  
• All critical accounting policies and policies used 
• Alternative GAAP methods that were discussed with management, the ramifications of 
the use of those alternative treatments, and the treatment preferred by the auditors 
• Any other material written communications between the auditors and management 
 
AUDITORS’ ATTESTATION TO INTERNAL CONTROLS 
As was stated previously, section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires every annual report 
to contain an internal control report which states that the company’s management is 
responsible for internal controls, and which also assesses the effectiveness of the internal 
control structures. Sarbanes-Oxley section 404 requires the company’s external auditors to 
attest to and issue a report on management’s assessment of internal controls.  
 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.223 
IMPROPER INFLUENCE ON AUDITS 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also makes it unlawful for any officer or director of a public 
company to take any action to fraudulently influence, coerce, manipulate, or mislead an 
auditor in the performance of an audit of the company’s financial statements. This is yet 
another attempt by Congress to ensure the independence and objectivity of audits to prevent 
accounting fraud and strengthen investor confidence in the reliability of public company 
financial statements.  
 
Enhanced Financial Disclosure Requirements 
OFF-BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act directed the SEC to issue  rules that require the disclosure of all 
material off-balance sheet transactions by publicly traded companies. The rules require 
disclosure of “all material off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations 
(including contingent obligations), and other relationships the company may have with 
unconsolidated entities or persons that may have a material current or future effect on the 
company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, liquidity, capital expenditures, 
capital resources, or significant components of revenues or expenses.” These disclosures are 
required in all annual and quarterly SEC reports. 
 
PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 401 increases the type and extent of disclosures in periodic reports 
filed with the SEC. Under section 401, pro forma financials that are filed with the SEC or 
that are included in any public disclosure or press release must not contain any untrue 
statements or omissions that would make them misleading, and they must be reconciled to GAAP.  
 
PROHIBITIONS ON PERSONAL LOANS TO EXECUTIVES 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 402 makes it illegal for public companies to make personal loans or 
otherwise extend credit, either directly or indirectly, to or for any director or executive 
officer. An exception applies to consumer lenders if the loans are consumer loans of the type 
the company normally makes to the public and are on the same terms. 
 
RESTRICTIONS ON INSIDER TRADING 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 403 establishes disclosure requirements for stock transactions by 
directors and officers of public companies, or by persons who own more than 10 percent of 
a publicly traded company’s stock. SEC rules further specify content and timing 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.224  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
requirements of blackout period notices that must be provided to directors and officers. 
Reports of changes in beneficial ownership by these persons must now be filed with the 
SEC by the end of the second business day following the transaction. 
 
Under Sarbanes-Oxley section 306, directors and officers are also prohibited from trading in 
the company’s securities during any pension fund blackout periods. This restriction only 
applies to securities that were acquired because of their employment or service to the 
company. A blackout period is defined as any period of more than three consecutive 
business days in which at least 50 percent of the participants in the company’s retirement 
plan are restricted from trading in the company’s securities. If a director or officer violates 
this provision, he can be forced to disgorge to the company all profits received from the sale 
of securities during the blackout period. 
 
CODES OF ETHICS FOR SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS  
Pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley section 406 and SEC release No. 33-8177, public companies 
must disclose in their annual report whether they have adopted a code of ethics for senior 
financial officers, and if they have not, they must explain their reasoning.  
 
ENHANCED REVIEW OF PERIODIC FILINGS 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 408 requires the SEC to make regular and systematic reviews of 
disclosures made by public companies in their periodic reports to the SEC. Reviews of a 
company’s disclosures, including its financial statements, must be made at least once every 
three years. Prior to this enactment, reviews were typically minimal and tended to coincide 
with registered offerings. 
 
REAL TIME DISCLOSURES  
Under Sarbanes-Oxley section 409, public companies must publicly disclose information 
concerning material changes in their financial condition or operations. These disclosures 
must be “in plain English” and must be  made “on a rapid and current basis.”  
 
Protections for Corporate Whistleblowers Under Sarbanes-Oxley 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act establishes broad protections for corporate whistleblowers. There 
are two sections of the Act that address whistleblower protections: Section 806 deals with 
civil protections and section 1107 establishes criminal liability for those who retaliate against 
whistleblowers.  
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.225 
CIVIL LIABILITY WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 806, which is codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1514A, creates civil liability for 
companies that retaliate against whistleblowers. It should be noted that this provision does 
not provide universal whistleblower protection; it only protects employees of publicly traded 
companies. Section 806 makes it unlawful to fire, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in 
any other manner discriminate against an employee for providing information or aiding in an 
investigation of securities fraud. To trigger section 806 protections, the employee must 
report the suspected misconduct to a federal regulatory or law enforcement agency, a 
member of Congress or a committee of Congress, or a supervisor. Employees are also 
protected against retaliation for filing, testifying in, participating in, or otherwise assisting in a 
proceeding filed, or about to be filed, relating to an alleged violation of securities laws or 
SEC rules. 
 
The whistleblower protections apply even if the company is ultimately found not to have 
committed securities fraud. As long as the employee reasonably believes he is reporting 
conduct that constitutes a violation of various federal securities laws, then he is protected. 
The protections not only cover retaliatory acts by the company, but also by any officer, 
employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of the company.  
 
If a public company is found to have violated Sarbanes-Oxley section 806, the Act provides 
for an award of compensatory damages sufficient to “make the employee whole.” Penalties 
include reinstatement; back pay with interest; and compensation for special damages, 
including litigation costs, expert witness fees, and attorneys’ fees.  
 
CRIMINAL SANCTION WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION  
Sarbanes-Oxley section 1107—codified at 18 U.S. C. § 1513 — makes it a crime to knowingly, 
with the intent to retaliate, take any harmful action against a person for providing truthful 
information relating to the commission or possible commission of any federal offense. This 
protection is only triggered when information is provided to a law enforcement officer. It 
does not apply to reports made to supervisors or to members of Congress, as is the case 
under Sarbanes-Oxley section 806.  
 
In general, the coverage of Sarbanes-Oxley section 1107 is much broader than the civil 
liability whistleblower protections of Sarbanes-Oxley section 806. While the Sarbanes-Oxley 
section 806 protections apply only to employees of publicly traded companies, Sarbanes-Oxley 
section 1107’s criminal whistleblower protections cover all individuals (and 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.226  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
organizations) regardless of where they work. Also, Sarbanes-Oxley section 806 only applies 
to violations of securities laws or SEC rules and regulations, whereas Sarbanes-Oxley section 
1107 protects individuals who provide truthful information about the commission or 
possible commission of any Federal offense.  
 
Violations of Sarbanes-Oxley section 1107 can be punished by fines of up to $250,000 and 
up to 10 years in prison for individuals. Corporations that violate the Act can be fined up to 
$500,000.  
 
Enhanced Penalties for White-Collar Crime 
As part of Congress’ general effort to deter corporate accounting fraud and other forms of 
white-collar crime, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also enhances the criminal penalties for a number 
of white-collar offenses.  
 
ATTEMPT AND CONSPIRACY (18 U.S.C. § 1349) 
The Act amends the fraud provisions of the U.S. Code (Chapter 63) to make “attempt” and 
“conspiracy to commit” offenses subject to the same penalties as the offense itself. This 
applies to mail fraud, wire fraud, securities fraud, bank fraud, and health care fraud. The text 
of the statute provides: 
 
Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense under this chapter [U.S. Code 
Chapter 63] shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the 
commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy. 
 
MAIL FRAUD AND WIRE FRAUD 
Sarbanes-Oxley amends the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343), 
increasing the maximum jail term from five to 20 years.  
 
SECURITIES FRAUD  
Section 807 creates an additional securities fraud offence that can carry a maximum sentence 
of 25 years in prison. Specifically, this law imposes criminal liability for anyone who 
knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud in connection 
with registered securities.  
 
The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA), signed into law by President 
Obama on May 20, 2009, contains a number of measures intended to combat fraud. Among 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.227 
other provisions, the legislation expands the definition of securities fraud in section 1348 to 
include fraud schemes involving commodities for future delivery or options on commodities 
for future delivery. 
 
DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION   
Sarbanes-Oxley section 802 makes destroying evidence to obstruct an investigation or any 
other matter within the jurisdiction of any U.S. department illegal and punishable by a fine of 
up to $250,000 and up to 20 years in prison.  
 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 802 also specifically requires that accountants who perform audits 
on publicly traded companies maintain all audit or review work papers for a period of five 
years. Violations of this rule may be punished by fines up to $250,000 and up to 10 years in 
jail for individuals, or fines up to $500,000  for corporations. (Although Sarbanes-Oxley  
section 802 only requires work papers to be maintained for five years, keep in mind that 
under Sarbanes-Oxley section 103, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is 
directed to set standards that require public accounting firms to maintain audit work papers 
for seven years. Accounting firms should design their document retention policies 
accordingly.)  
 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 1102 amends section 1512 of the U.S. Code to make it a criminal 
offense to corruptly alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal a record or document with the intent 
to impair its integrity or use in an official proceeding, or to otherwise obstruct, influence, or 
impede any official proceeding or attempt to do so. Violations of this section are punishable 
by fines up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to 20 years.  
 
FREEZING OF ASSETS 
During an investigation of possible securities violations by a publicly traded company or any 
of its officers, directors, partners, agents, controlling persons, or employees, the SEC can 
petition a federal court to issue a 45-day freeze on “extraordinary payments” to any of the 
foregoing persons. If granted, the payments will be placed in an interest-bearing escrow 
account while the investigation commences. This provision was enacted to prevent 
corporate assets from being improperly distributed while an investigation is underway.  
 
BANKRUPTCY LOOPHOLES 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 803 amends the bankruptcy code so that judgments, settlements, 
damages, fines, penalties, restitution payments, disgorgement payments, etc., resulting from 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.228  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
violations of federal securities laws are nondischargeable. This was intended to prevent 
corporate wrongdoers from sheltering their assets under bankruptcy protection.  
 
DISGORGEMENT OF BONUSES 
One of the most unique aspects of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is section 304, which states that 
if a publicly traded company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the 
company’s material noncompliance (as a result of “misconduct”) with any financial reporting 
requirement under securities laws, then the CEO and CFO must reimburse the company for: 
• Any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation received during the 
12 months after the initial filing of the report that requires restating; and  
• Any profits realized from the sale of the company’s securities during the same 12-month 
period. 
 
While the Act requires the CEO and CFO to disgorge their bonuses if the company’s 
financial statements have to be restated because of “misconduct,” it makes no mention of 
whose misconduct triggers this provision. There is certainly nothing in the text of Sarbanes-
 Oxley section 304 that limits the disgorgement provision to instances of misconduct by the 
CEO and CFO. Presumably, then, the CEO and CFO could be required to disgorge their 
bonuses and profits from the sale of company stock even if they had no knowledge of and 
took no part in the misconduct that made the restatement necessary.  
 
Extended Statute of Limitations for Federal Securities Fraud 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also amended the statute of limitations for several securities fraud 
claims. Section 804 of the Act extends the statute of limitations to the earlier of two years 
after the discovery of facts constituting fraud or five years after such violation. Prior to the 
Act, the statute of limitations was the earlier of one year after the discovery of facts 
constituting fraud or three years after such violation.  
 
However, the extended statute of limitations only applies to causes of action involving “a 
claim of fraud, deceit, manipulation, or contrivance.” Even though litigation has arisen over 
the types of claims subject to the extension, it is clear that section 804 extends the statute of 
limitations for section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims.  
 
Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act 
On May 20, 2009, President Obama signed into law the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery 
Act (FERA). This legislation contains a number of measures intended to combat fraud and 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.229 
to protect against fraud, waste, and abuse in federal programs. Specifically, this legislation 
broadens federal statutes used to prosecute financial fraud, expands potential liability for 
false claims, authorizes additional funding for fraud investigations, prosecutions, and civil 
proceedings, and creates the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission to examine the causes, 
domestic and global, of the current financial and economic crisis in the United States. 
 
Strengthened Criminal Statutes 
FERA is designed to increase anti-fraud enforcement by enhancing a number of federal 
criminal statutes used to prosecute financial fraud. First, it amends the definition of 
“financial institution” in the criminal code to include mortgage lending businesses. Under 
the revised definition, the Justice Department  may prosecute mortgage fraud cases as bank 
fraud and seek enhanced penalties under the mail and wire fraud statutes.  
 
Second, FERA broadens the prohibition against making false statements in mortgage 
applications to employees and agents of mortgage lenders. FERA amends the false 
statements in mortgage applications statute (18 U.S.C. § 1014) to include a prohibition of 
false statements in mortgage applications intended to influence any action by a mortgage 
lending business. Before FERA, section 1014 did not necessarily extend to private mortgage 
lending businesses.  
 
Third, FERA amends the major fraud statute (18 U.S.C. § 1031) to cover fraud in funds 
provided under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and other funds constituting 
federal assistance.  
 
Fourth, the legislation amends the federal securities statute (18 U.S.C. § 1348), which 
imposes criminal liability for securities fraud, to include fraud schemes involving 
commodities for future delivery or options on commodities for future delivery. 
 
Finally, FERA amends anti-money-laundering laws to broaden the term proceeds to include 
the gross receipts of unlawful activity, rather than merely its profits. This amendment 
addresses a recent Supreme Court ruling that proceeds of criminal activity, as treated by 
federal money laundering statutes, included only the defendant’s profits from such activity.  
 
Modifications to the False Claims Act 
In addition to the modifications of criminal law, FERA enacts several changes to the civil 
False Claims Act (FCA), 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–37 33, which increase the potential for liability 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.230  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
under the Act. Among other significant changes, FERA amends the FCA in the following 
ways:  
• FERA eliminates the requirement that a false claim be presented to a federal official or 
that it directly involve federal funds. Before FERA, the FCA required that allegedly false 
claims for payment be presented directly to an officer or employee of the government. 
In addition, the legislation broadens the definition of a “claim” under the FCA to include 
any request or demand for property, even if the United States does not have title to the 
money or property.  
• FERA also reduces the intent required to establish liability under section 3729(a) by 
removing the to get language from the statute. By removing the words to get, FERA 
overturns the Supreme Court’s 2008 holding in Allison Engine Co. v. United States that a 
defendant must intend to get a false claim paid by the government. As a result, liability can 
attach even if the defendant did not intend to get a false claim paid by the government.  
• Additionally, FERA enhanced the whistleblower protections under the FCA, which 
allows employees to seek relief against their employer if they are retaliated against for 
whistleblowing. FERA now makes these retaliation claims available to government 
contractors and agents.   
 
Additional Appropriations for Fraud Investigations, Prosecutions, and Civil Proceedings 
In addition to modifying financial fraud statutes, FERA authorizes additional appropriations 
for the government’s fraud enforcement efforts over the next two fiscal years.  
 
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission 
FERA also creates the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission “to examine the causes, 
domestic and global, of the current financial and economic crisis in the United States.” The 
Commission may hold hearings, take testimony, receive evidence, issue subpoenas, and 
obtain information from governmental entities. 
  
Mail Fraud and Wire Fraud 
The mail and wire fraud laws prohibit the use of mail or wires, including the Internet, in 
furtherance of a fraudulent scheme designed to obtain money or property. Virtually any 
intentional scheme to deceive or deprive another of money, property, or any other valuable 
right or interest by fraud or false pretenses is within the scope of the statute. 
 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.231 
Mail Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341) 
The mail fraud statute is the workhorse of federal white-collar prosecutions. It has been used 
against virtually all types of commercial fraud, public corruption, and security law violations. 
In general, mail fraud is the use of the mail to perpetrate a scheme to defraud a victim of 
money or property. The statute provides: 
 
Whoever, having devised or intend ing to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining 
money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, or to 
sell, dispose of, loan, exchange, alter, give away, distribute, supply, or furnish or procure for 
unlawful use any counterfeit or spurious coin, obligation, security, or other article, or anything 
represented to be or in timated or held out to be such counterfeit or spurious article, for the 
purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or a ttempting so to do, places in any post office or 
authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by 
the Postal Service, deposits or ca uses to be deposited any matter or thing whatever to be sent or 
delivered by any private or commercial interstate carrier, or takes or receive, any such matter or 
thing, or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail according to the direction thereon, or at the 
place at which it is directed to be delivered by  the person to whom it is addressed, any such 
matter or thing, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or 
both. If the violation affects a financial institution, such person shall be fined not more than 
$1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both. 
 
The gist of the offense is the use of the mail. Thus, where the postal system is not used, no 
matter how large or serious the fraud, there is no federal jurisdiction under this statute. Yet, 
the mailing does not itself need to contain the false and fraudulent representations, as long as 
it is an integral part of the scheme. What is integral or incidental depends on the facts of 
each case; generally, a mailing that helps advance the scheme in any significant way will be 
considered sufficient. 
 
Frauds and swindles are not defined in the mail fraud statute or elsewhere in the U.S. Code. 
Most of the cases treat any intentional scheme to deceive and deprive another of a tangible 
property right as being within the statute.  
 
It is not necessary that the fraudulent scheme succeed or that the victim suffer a loss for the 
statute to apply. It also is not necessary that the predicate mailing travel in interstate 
commerce; any use of the U.S. postal system provides sufficient grounds for federal 
jurisdiction. 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.232  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) 
The wire fraud statute is similar to the mail fraud statute. Generally defined, wire fraud is the 
use of wire communications to perpetrate a scheme to defraud a victim of money or 
property. The text of the statute provides: 
 
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining 
money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, 
transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in 
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of 
executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 
twenty years, or both. If the violation affects a financial institution, such person shall be fined 
not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both. 
 
The wire fraud statute often is used in tandem with mail fraud counts in federal 
prosecutions. Unlike mail fraud, however, the wire fraud statute requires an interstate or 
foreign communication for a violation. 
 
“Honest Services” Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1346) 
Under section 1346 of Title 18, U.S. Code, the mail fraud and the wire fraud statutes may be 
used to prosecute official corruption, along with the bribery laws, under the theory that the 
payment or receipt of bribes deprived the public of its right to honest and unbiased services 
of public servants. Specifically, section 1346 provides “the term scheme or artifice to defraud  
[which is the term used in the mail and wire fraud statutes among others] includes a scheme 
or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.” 
 
This statute generally is referred to as the “honest services” fraud statute, and its core 
application is bribery or conflict of interest involving a public official that affects his official 
duties.  
 
Congress specifically enacted section 1346 in response to the U.S. Supreme Court decision 
rendered in the case of McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350 (1987). In McNally, the Supreme 
Court tried to halt the expansion of the mail and wire fraud statutes, ruling that those laws 
did not prohibit schemes to defraud citizens of the intangible right to honest government.  
 
  
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.233 
A year later, Congress effectively overruled McNally by enacting section 1346 to ensure that 
mail and wire fraud would reach the deprivation of citizens’ rights to the honest services of 
their public officials.  
 
The crime of honest services contains the following elements: (1) a scheme to defraud that 
includes a material deception, (2) with the intent to defraud, (3) while using the mail or 
interstate wires in furtherance of that scheme, and (4) that resulted in the deprivation of the 
intangible right of honest services.  
 
Although its core involves public officials who, in violation of their fiduciary duties, accept 
bribes or personally benefit from undisclosed conflicts of interest, prosecutors have used the 
honest services statute to address a wide range of conduct by public officials and private 
actors, which make it a valuable tool for federal prosecutors in cases involving fraud. 
 
The law, however, has long been criticized for being so vague that it allows prosecutors to 
criminalize behavior that might not be explicitly illegal, and over time, the vagueness of 
“honest services” led to a medley of conflicting interpretations as courts struggled with how 
to apply the statute. 
 
In 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on the conviction of former Enron CEO 
Jeffrey Skilling, agreeing to harmonize the conflicting interpretations of this law. 
 
And on June 24, 2010, the Court issued a unanimous ruling, holding that the honest services 
law couldn’t be used to convict Skilling for his role in the collapse of Enron. 1 
 
In its opinion, the Court rejected Skilling’s argument on appeal that the definition of “honest 
services” was unconstitutionally vague, but it did hold that the government stretched the law 
too far when it prosecuted Skilling. The Court said Congress enacted the statute specifically 
to address bribery and kickbacks, but found that the statute could become vague if applied 
to “a wider range of offensive conduct.”   
 
Accordingly, the Court ruled that the statute wasn’t unconstitutionally vague if limited to 
bribery and kickback schemes. That is, defendants accused of violating the honest services 
statutes must have gained some benefit from the alleged conduct. And because the 
                                                 
1 S killing v. United States, No. 08-1394 (June 24, 2010). 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.234  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
government didn’t accuse Skilling of bribery or taking kickbacks, the Court sent his case 
back to the lower courts to determine whether his conviction should be overturned. 
 
In a companion case, the Court also sided with imprisoned media executive Conrad Black, 
who was convicted of honest services fraud for failing to disclose noncompetition fees, 
setting aside a federal appeals decision that upheld Black’s conviction. But as in Skilling’s 
case, Black’s conviction won’t necessarily be overturned; instead, the case will be sent back 
to the federal appellate court for further consideration.  
 
Moreover, because the Skilling  case has limited the honest services statute to bribery and 
kickbacks, it makes it more difficult for prosecutors to pursue criminal cases against 
corporate executives for misconduct that harms their companies. As a result, the decision 
will likely result in fewer private-sector fraud cases brought under the honest services fraud 
law.  
 
But even with the Court’s ruling, prosecutors still have a variety of other, less controversial 
laws they can invoke in fraud cases.  
 
Embezzlement and Theft of Federal Money or Property (18 U.S.C. § 641) 
Section 641 of Title 18 is the principal federal statute aimed at protecting government 
property. This statute criminalizes intentional and unauthorized taking, destruction, or use of 
government money, property, or records, and it also prohibits receiving or concealing such 
property or records. The text of section 641 provides: 
 
Whoever embezzles, steals, purloins, or knowingly converts to his use or the use of another, or 
without authority, sells, conveys or disposes of any record, voucher, money, or thing of value of 
the United States or of any department or agency thereof, or any proper ty made or being made 
under contract for the United States or any department or agency thereof; or Whoever receives, 
conceals, or retains the same with intent to convert it to his use or gain, knowing it to have been 
embezzled, stolen, purloined or converted — Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not 
more than ten years, or both; but if the value of such property in the aggregate, combining 
amounts from all the counts for which the defendant is convicted in a single case, does not exceed 
the sum of $1,000, he shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or 
both.  
 
The following sections outline the offenses encompassed by section 641. 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.235 
Embezzlement of Government Property 
To review, embezzlement is the fraudulent appropriation of money or property by a person to 
whom it has been lawfully entrusted (or to whom lawful possession was given). The 
elements of embezzlement, as defined in section 641, are: 
• There was a trust or fiduciary relationship between the defendant and the property 
owner. 
• The defendant took or converted money or property.  
• The property was entrusted to the defendant (defendant had lawful possession of the 
property).  
• The defendant intended to take or convert the property (not by accident or mistake). 
• The property at issue belonged to the United States. 
 
Larceny  
Larceny is defined as the unlawful taking of money or property of another with the intent to 
convert or to deprive the owner. Unlike embezzlement schemes, in larceny schemes, the 
defendant never has lawful possession of the property, but he may have mere custody of it 
(e.g., a cashier has custody, not possession, of money in a register). To establish a violation 
under section 641, the government must prove the following: 
• The defendant fraudulently appropriated money or property of another. 
• The appropriation occurred without the consent of the owner. 
• The defendant intended to convert it to his use. 
• The property at issue belonged to the United States. 
 
However, it is not necessary to prove that the defendant knew that the property belonged to 
the federal government. 
 
Penalties 
If the value of the property is $100 or less, a defendant is subject to one year of 
imprisonment, a $1,000 fine, or both. When the value of the property exceeds $100, the 
defendant may be sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment, a fine equal to the amount of the 
property taken, or both.  
 
Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property (18 U.S.C. § 2314) 
Section 2314 of Title 18, U.S. Code, regulates interstate transportation of stolen property. 
Popularly known as ITSP, section 2314 is often used in fraud prosecutions in conjunction 
with mail or wire fraud counts, or to provide federal jurisdiction in their absence when 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.236  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
proceeds of a value of $5,000 or more obtained by fraud are transported across state lines. 
The statute also is violated if a defendant induces the victim to travel in interstate commerce 
as part of the scheme to defraud. Individual transportation of money or other items valued 
at less than $5,000 as part of the same sc heme may be aggregated to meet the value 
requirement. 
 
Also, prosecutors have attempted to charge defendants in violation of the ITSP statute in 
addition to or in lieu of the theft of commercial trade secrets or the theft of other 
proprietary information charges. It is clear that section 2314 applies when defendants steal 
tangible items, which qualify as goods, wares, or merchandise, that contain intellectual 
property. However, courts have had varying opinions on the characterization of intellectual 
property as “goods, wares, merchandise, securities, or money” when an individual steals 
intangible property through intangible means. For example, in United States v. Brown, 925 F.2d 
1301 (10th Cir. 1991), the Tenth Circuit held that the theft of intellectual property through 
intangible means does not implicate section 2314. Alternatively, the courts in United States v. 
Riggs, 739 F.Supp. 414 (N.D. Ill. 1990) and United States v. Farraj, 142 F. Supp. 2d 484 
(S.D.N.Y. 2001) reached the opposite result.  
 
Even though prosecutors may use the ITSP to prosecute theft of commercial trade secrets, 
proprietary information, or other types of intellectual property in certain situations, they 
cannot use the ITSP to prosecute copyright infringement cases unless the infringement 
involves the theft of a tangible piece of hardware. 
 
Finally, when patent infringement is the only theory for an individual to steal a piece of 
property, the ITSP does not allow prosecution for interstate transportation of patent-
 infringing goods. 
 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (18 U.S.C. § 1961, et. seq.)  
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute is probably the best-
 known and most controversial federal statute in use today. Originally enacted in 1970 to 
fight organized crime’s infiltration of legitimate business, its powerful criminal and civil 
provisions have come to be used in a wide range of fraud cases. The statute outlaws the 
investment of ill-gotten gains in another business enterprise; the acquisition of an interest in 
an enterprise through certain illegal acts; and the conduct of the affairs of an enterprise 
through such acts.  
 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.237 
RICO provides both criminal penalties and civil remedies. Criminal penalties include stiff 
fines and prison terms, as well as the forfeiture of all illegal proceeds or interests. Civil 
remedies include treble damages, attorneys’ fees, dissolution of the offending enterprise, and 
other penalties. 
 
RICO Violations Under Section 1962(c) 
Section 1962(c) is probably the most commonly used provision. It makes it an offense for 
any person associated with an “enterprise” that is engaged in interstate commerce to 
participate in the affairs of such an enterprise through a “pattern of racketeering activity.” 
The elements of a section 1962(c) offense are: 
• The defendant was employed by or associated with an “enterprise” as defined in the 
statute, which can be a business, union, a group of individuals “associated in fact,” or 
even a single individual. 
• The enterprise was engaged in or affected interstate commerce. 
• The defendant conducted the affairs of the enterprise through a “pattern of racketeering 
activity,” that is, two or more illegal acts enumerated in the statute as predicate 
violations, such as mail and wire fraud or ITSP violations. 
 
EMPLOYED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH AN ENTERPRISE 
Under this element, the government must show that the defendant was directly involved in 
the management of the enterprise as an employee, officer, director, owner, or other person 
with substantial management authority. An outside consultant, accountant, or attorney who 
does not have substantial management authority is not liable. 
 
An enterprise includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association or other legal 
entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact, although not a legal entity. 
The enterprise should be an entity distinct from the “person” or “persons” who violate the 
statute. An enterprise includes both a legitimate and an illegal organization. 
 
ENGAGED IN INTERSTATE OR FOREIGN COMMERCE 
This element is met if the enterprise conducts business in or affects, even if only to a 
minimal extent, commerce or trade between two or more states or a foreign country. Proof 
of an effect on interstate commerce may be showing that the enterprise buys, sells, or 
transports goods or services in more than one state or a foreign country. 
 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.238  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
CONDUCTED THE AFFAIRS THROUGH A PATTERN OF RACKETEERING ACTIVITY 
The defendant violates this element if he has some involvement in the management or 
operation of the enterprise and in the commission of two or more “racketeering offenses” 
through the enterprise. The term racketeering activity  includes a broad assortment of state and 
federal crimes, such as bribery, extortion, bankruptcy fraud, mail fraud, and securities fraud. 
 
Pattern means at least two acts of racketeering activity, the last of which occurred within 10 
years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after a prior act. Proof of a pattern requires 
that the acts be connected in some manner and not be separate, isolated, or random crimes. 
Each act must have “continuity plus relationship,” that is, the same or a similar purpose, 
result, participants, victims, methods of commission, or be otherwise related. 
 
Civil RICO Actions 
The most controversial aspect of RICO is its civil provisions. Under section 1964, civil 
actions may be brought by the government or any private party injured in his business or 
property. Critics complain that private party suits have been used to reach “deep pocket” 
defendants, such as accounting firms, who cannot be characterized as “racketeers”; and to 
coerce unwarranted settlements from blameless defendants fearful of possible treble damage 
judgments. Supporters contend that a plaintiff cannot recover unless there is proof of fraud 
or other criminal acts — whomever the defendant — making the stigma of being alleged a 
racketeer and the award of treble damages justified.  
 
False Claims and Statements 
Chapter 47 of Title 18, U.S. Code, contains a number of related provisions that punish false 
or fraudulent statements, orally or in writing, made to various federal agencies and 
departments.  
 
The principal federal false statements statute is 18 U.S.C. § 1001. Briefly stated, section 1001 
prohibits a person from lying to or concealing information from a federal official; however, 
this statute overlaps with many of the more specific laws, such as 18 U.S.C. § 1014, which 
apply to false statements made on certain loan and credit applications. 
 
A statement is false for the purposes of section 1001 if it was known to be untrue when it 
was made, and it is fraudulent if it was known to be untrue and was made with the intent to 
deceive a government agency. For a violation to occur, the agency need not actually have 
been deceived, nor must it have in fact relied upon the false statement. The statement must 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.239 
have been capable, however, of influencing the agency involved. 
The elements of a typical section 1001 violation are set forth below: 
• The defendant made a false statement (or used a false document) 
• That was material 
• Regarding a matter within the jurisdiction of any agency of the United States 
• With knowledge of its falsity 
• Knowingly and willfully (or with reckless disregard for truth or falsity) 
 
Section 1001 is most often used to prosecute false statements to law enforcement or 
regulatory officials not made under oath, in the course of an official investigation, or on an 
application for such things as federal employment, credit, and visa applications. The 
statute — a felony — also may be used in lieu of the misdemeanor provisions of the IRS Code 
for filing false documents with tax returns. (See the Financial Transactions Section for 
additional information on tax fraud.) 
 
In recent years, we have seen more instances of prosecution under this statute. Take, for 
example, the infamous case of Martha Stewart in 2003. In Stewart’s case, the SEC was 
conducting an investigation into an insider-trading scheme based upon Stewart’s disposal of 
ImClone stock shares in 2001. Rather than prosecuting Stewart for insider trading, she was 
charged with and convicted of, among other crimes, providing the government with false 
statements. Another prominent example of a prosecution under this statute involved Lewis 
“Scooter” Libby, a former senior White House official. On March 6, 2007, Libby was found 
guilty of, among other crimes, lying to the FBI about information he disbursed regarding a 
CIA operative’s employment. 
 
The false statement statutes of greatest importance to the fraud examiner follow. 
 
18 U.S.C. § 1001. Statements or Entries Generally 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction 
of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, 
knowingly and willfully — 
(1) falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; 
(2) makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations; 
(3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, 
fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry; 
shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or, if the offense involves 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.240  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
international or domestic terrorism, imprisoned not more than 8 years, or both. If the 
matter relates to an offense under chapter 109A, 109B, 110, or 1 17, or section 1591, 
then the term of imprisonment imposed under this section shall be not more than 8 years.  
  
(b) Subsection (a) does not apply to a party to a judicial proceeding, or that party’s counsel, for 
statements, representations, writings, or documents submitted by such party or counsel to a 
judge or magistrate in that proceeding. 
 
(c) With respect to any matter within the jurisdiction of the legislative branch, subsection (a) 
shall apply only to — 
(1)  administrative matters, including a claim for payment, a matter related to the 
procurement of property or services, personnel or employment practices, or support 
services, or a document required by law, rule, or regulation to be submitted to the 
Congress or any office or officer within the legislative branch; or 
(2)  any investigation or review, conducted purs uant to the authority of any committee, 
subcommittee, commission or office of the congress, consistent with the applicable rules 
of the House or Senate. 
 
18 U.S.C. § 1002. Possession of False Papers to Defraud the United States  
Section 1002 makes it a crime to knowingly possess any false, altered, forged, or 
counterfeited writing or document with intent to defraud the government. The text of this 
statute provides: 
 
Whoever, knowingly and with intent to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof, 
possesses any false, altered, forged, or counterf eited writing or document for the purpose of 
enabling another to obtain from the United States, or from any agency, officer or agent thereof, 
any sum of money, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.  
 
18 U.S.C. § 1003. Demands Against the United States  
This statute criminalizes the making of fraudulent demands for money against the United 
States. Specifically, section 1003 provides: 
 
Whoever knowingly and fraudulently demands or endeavors to obtain any share or sum in the 
public stocks of the United States, or to have any part thereof transferred, assigned, sold, or 
conveyed, or to have any annuity, dividend, pension, wages, gratuity, or other debt due from the 
United States, or any part thereof, received, or paid by virtue of any false, forged, or 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.241 
counterfeited power of attorney, authority, or instrument, shall be fined under this title or 
imprisoned not more than five years, or both; but if the sum or value so obtained or attempted to 
be obtained does not exceed $100, he shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 
one year, or both. 
 
18 U.S.C. § 1005. Bank Entries, Reports, and Transactions 
Section 1005 makes it unlawful, among other things, for any officer, director, agent, or 
employee of a federally insured or chartered bank to make any false entries on the books of 
such institution with the intent to injure or defraud the bank or third parties, or to deceive 
any bank officer, examiners, or government agency. The text of the statute states:  
 
Whoever, being an officer, director, agent, or employee of any Federal Reserve Bank, member 
bank, depository institution holding company, national bank, insured bank, branch or agency of a 
foreign bank, or organization operating under section 25 or section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve 
Act without authority from the directors of such bank, branch, agency, or organization or 
company, issues or puts in circulation any notes of such bank, branch, agency, or organization or 
company; or 
 
Whoever, without such authority, makes, draws, issues, puts forth, or assigns any certificate of 
deposit, draft, order, bill of exchange, acceptan ce, note, debenture, bond, or other obligation, or 
mortgage, judgment or decree; or 
 
Whoever makes any false entry in any book, report, or statement of such bank, company, branch, 
agency, or organization with intent to injure or defraud such ba nk, company, branch, agency, or 
organization, or any other company, body politic or corporate, or any individual person, or to 
deceive any officer of such bank, company, branch, agency, or organization, or the Comptroller of 
the Currency, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any agent or examiner appointed 
to examine the affairs of such bank, company, branch, agency, or organization or the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System; 
 
Whoever with intent to defraud the United States or any agency thereof, or any financial 
institution referred to in this section, participates or shares in or receives (directly or indirectly) any 
money, profit, property, or benefits through any transaction, loan, commission, contract, or any 
other act of any such financial institution — 
 
Shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than thirty years, or both. 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.242  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
18 U.S.C. § 1014. Loan and Credit Applications Generally; Renewals and Discounts; Crop Insurance 
Section 1014 prohibits false statements or reports upon any credit application or related 
document submitted to a federally insured bank or credit institution for purposes of 
influencing such organization’s action in any way.  As with section 1001, the false statements 
must be willful, but they need not have been relied upon or actually deceived the agency for 
a violation to occur.  
 
On May 20, 2009, President Obama signed into law the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery 
Act (FERA), which contains a number of measures intended to combat fraud. Among other 
things, FERA amends section 1014 to include a prohibition of false statements in mortgage 
applications intended to influence any action by a mortgage lending business.  
 
The text of section 1014 provides: 
 
Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or report, or willfully overvalues any land, 
property, or security, for the purp ose of influencing in any way the action of the Farm Credit 
Administration, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, or a company the Corporation reinsures, 
the Secretary of Agriculture acting through the Farmers Home Administration or successor 
agency, the Rural Development Administration or successor agency, any Farm Credit Bank, 
production credit association, agricultural credit association, bank for cooperatives, or any 
division, officer, or employee thereof, or of any regional agricultural credit corporation established 
pursuant to law, or a Federal land bank, a Federal land bank association, a Federal Reserve 
Bank, a small business investment company, as defined in section 103 of the Small Business 
Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 662), or the Small Business Administration in 
connection with any provision of that Act, a Federal credit union, an insured State-chartered 
credit union, any institution the accounts of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, the Office of Thrift Supervision, any Federal home loan bank, the Federal 
Housing Finance Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Resolution Trust 
Corporation, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, or the National Credit Union 
Administration Board, a branch or agency of a foreign bank (as such terms are defined in 
paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978), or an 
organization operating under section 25 or section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, upon any 
application, advance, discount, purchase, purchase agreement, repurchase agreement, 
commitment, or loan, or any change or extension of any of the same, by renewal, deferment of 
action or otherwise, or the acceptance, release, or substitution of security therefor, shall be fined 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.243 
not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both. The term “State-
 chartered credit union” includes a credit union chartered under the laws of a state of the United 
States, the District of Columbia, or any commonw ealth, territory, or possession of the United 
States. 
 
Conspiracy to Defraud Federal Government with False Claims (18 U.S.C. § 286) 
This section makes it a crime for two or more persons to agree or conspire to defraud the 
United States by obtaining or aiding in obtaining payment or allowance of any false, 
fictitious, or fraudulent claim. The statute provides: 
 
Whoever enters into any agreement, combination, or conspiracy to defraud the United States, or 
any department or agency thereof, by obtaining or aiding to obtain the payment or allowance of 
any false or fraudulent claim, shall be fined under this title or impris oned not more than ten 
years or both. 
 
False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Claims (18 U.S.C. § 287) 
Frequently referred to as the Criminal False Claims Act, this statute makes it illegal to 
present or make any false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim against any agency or department of 
the United States. Section 287 provides: 
 
Whoever makes or presents to any person or officer in the civil, military, or naval service of the 
United States, or any department or agency thereof, any claim upon or against the United 
States, or any department or agency thereof, knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or 
fraudulent shall be imprisoned not more than five years and subject to a fine in the amount 
provided in this title. 
 
To establish violation of this statute, the government must establish that the defendant:  
• Made or presented a false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim to a department of the United 
States  
• Knew such claim was false, fictitious, or fraudulent 
• Did so with the specific intent to violate the law or knew that what he was doing was 
wrong 
 
The Major Fraud Act of 1988 (18 U.S.C. § 1031) 
The Major Fraud Act covers conduct prohibited by existing statutes and applies to contracts 
with the United States of $1 million or more. If convicted, the defendant may be imprisoned 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.244  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
for up to 10 years, and fined up to $10 million. See the “Laws Relating to Government 
Contracting” section below for more information. 
 
Civil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. § 3729, et seq.) 
The Civil False Claims Act is the civil counterpart to the criminal False Claims Act. It 
provides a separate civil cause of action that may be taken in addition to a criminal 
prosecution. 
 
The Civil False Claims Act provides in part that a person who commits the following acts is 
liable to the government for treble damages it sustains and a civil penalty of $5,000 to 
$10,000 per false claim: 
• Knowingly presents or causes to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or 
approval (§ 3729(a)(1)) 
• Knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used a false record or statement to get a 
false or fraudulent claim paid or approved (§ 3729(a)(2)) 
• Conspires to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or 
paid (§ 3729(a)(3)) 
• Knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used a false record or statement to 
conceal, avoid, or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the 
government (§ 3729(a)(7)) 
 
Knowing and knowingly are defined as the person having actual knowledge of the information; 
acting in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information; or acting in reckless 
disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. No proof of specific intent to defraud is 
required.  
 
A claim is defined as any request or demand, whether under a contract or otherwise, for 
money or property that is made to a contractor, grantee, or other recipient if the U.S. 
government provides any portion of the money or property which is requested or 
demanded, or if the government will reimburse such contractor, grantee, or other recipient 
for any portion of the money or property which is requested or demanded. 
 
On May 20, 2009, President Obama signed into law the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery 
Act (FERA), which enacts several changes that expand liability under the False Claims Act. 
Among other significant changes, FERA amends the False Claims Act in the following ways:  
• FERA eliminates the requirement that a false claim be presented to a federal official or 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.245 
that it directly involve federal funds. Before FERA, the False Claims Act required that 
allegedly false claims for payment be presented directly to an officer or employee of the 
government. The legislation broadens the definition of a claim under the False Claims 
Act to include any request or demand for property, even if the United States does not 
have title to the money or property.  
• FERA also reduces the intent required to establish liability under section 3729(a) by 
removing the to get language from the statute. By removing the words to get, FERA 
overturns the Supreme Court’s 2008 holding in Allison Engine Co. v. United States that a 
defendant must intend to get a false claim paid by the government. As a result, liability can 
attach even if the defendant did not intend to get a false claim paid by the government.  
 
The False Claims Act also allows a private person to prosecute a civil action against the 
perpetrator(s) on behalf of the government. This is called a qui tam action. Once the suit is 
filed, the federal government may take over prosecution or leave the case to the private 
individual. If the government joins the case, the Justice Department has primary 
responsibility, but the plaintiff continues to be a party to the action. If the government 
successfully prosecutes the suit, the private party may be awarded 15–25 percent of the 
recovery, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.  If the government does not take over 
the prosecution, and the qui tam plaintiff successfully wins the case on his own, the court 
may award the plaintiff 25–30 percent of the recovery, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and 
costs.  
 
Program Fraud Civil Remedies (31 U.S.C. §§ 3801-3812) 
These provisions provide for agency administrative adjudication of relatively small false 
claims (less than $150,000) and for which the agency has approval to prosecute from the 
Department of Justice. The purpose of the fraud civil remedy is to provide the agency with 
the ability to prosecute those cases that would otherwise not be prosecuted in the courts 
because of the cost of a civil court action and relatively low potential recovery.  
 
Civil Monetary Penalty Law (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a) 
The Civil Monetary Penalty Law (CMPL) was passed to impose administrative sanctions 
against providers who defraud any federally funded program by filing false claims or other 
improper billing practices. Any person (including an organization, agency, or other entity, 
but excluding a beneficiary) that presents or causes to be presented a claim for a medical 
service or other item or service that the person knows or should know is false or fraudulent 
is subject to a civil monetary penalty.  
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.246  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
The penalty is not more than $10,000 per line item or service and an assessment of not more 
than three times the amount claimed. In addition, the person may be excluded from 
participation in government programs.  
 
Some examples of false claims and statements include: 
• Falsified contractor qualifications 
• False certifications or assurances 
• False records or invoices 
• Invoices from nonexistent companies 
• Claims made in duplicate or altered invoices 
• Billing for fictitious employees 
• Billing for goods and services not provided 
• Inflated costs or substitution of cheaper goods 
 
Other examples of false claims and statements might include false statements about 
employees, fictitious transactions, and falsified documents. 
 
Insurance Fraud Prevention Act (18 U.S.C. § 1033) 
The Insurance Fraud Prevention Act criminalizes certain actions by people who are 
“engaged in the business of insurance.” The statute makes it a crime to provide false 
statements or reports to any insurance regulatory agency. It also prohibits false statements of 
any kind made to anyone regarding the financial condition or solvency of an insurance 
company. Section 1033 also criminalizes the embezzlement or misappropriation of any 
money, funds, premiums, or other property related to the insurance business.  
 
Misprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. § 4) 
Even though citizens have no general duty to report criminal activity, 18 U.S.C. § 4 
recognizes misprision of felony as a criminal offense. In general terms, misprision of felony 
is a crime dealing with the failure to report a crime where there is a legal duty to do so. The 
text of 18 U.S.C. § 4 provides:  
 
Whoever, having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony cognizable by a court of the United 
States, conceals and does not as soon  as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in 
civil or military authority under the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more 
than three years, or both. 
 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.247 
Under the federal statute, the prosecution must prove the following four elements to obtain 
a misprision of felony conviction: “(1) the principal committed and completed the felony 
alleged; (2) the defendant had knowledge of the fact; (3) the defendant failed to notify the 
authorities; and (4) the defendant took affirmative steps to conceal the crime of the 
principal.” 
 
Even though the federal misprision of felony is rarely prosecuted, a recent bribery scandal 
illustrates its applicability to white collar crime. In July 2008, attorney Zach Scruggs received 
fourteen months in prison and a $250,000 fine after pleading guilty to misprision of felony. 
Specifically, Scruggs committed a criminal offense because he failed to report a conspiracy 
by other lawyers to bribe a Mississippi judge. 
 
Federal Corruption Statutes (18 U.S.C. § 201, et seq.) 
Chapter 11 of 18 U.S.C. § 201 has 19 separate criminal provisions that define and prohibit a 
wide variety of conflicts of interest and other corrupt and unethical conduct involving public 
officials. The statutes of particular interest to fraud examiners follow. 
 
Bribery of Public Officials and Witnesses (18 U.S.C. § 201) 
Section 201 is the principal federal anti-corruption statute, and applies to virtually any U.S. 
official, juror, or witness. The section contains two separate offenses: bribery of public 
officials and illegal gratuities. 
 
BRIBERY OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS (18 U.S.C. § 201(b)) 
Section 201(b) makes it a crime for anyone to bribe a public official. More specifically, it 
prohibits giving or receiving something of value for the purpose of influencing the 
performance of an official act. Under section 201(b), bribery is punishable by up to 15 years 
imprisonment, fine, and disqualification from holding public office. 
 
The elements of an official bribery offense under section 201(b) are as follows: 
• Giving or receiving 
• Anything of value 
• With intent to corruptly influence 
• An official act 
 
GRATUITIES (18 U.S.C. 201(c)) 
Section 201(c) prohibits giving a government employee something of value because of his 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.248  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
official position. The illegal gratuity statute is a lesser-included offense of bribery. As stated, 
a bribe is a payment made with the purpose of influencing (changing) official conduct. A 
gratuity is a payment made to reward or compensate an official for performing duties he 
lawfully is required to perform. Moreover, unlike the bribery offense, there is no requirement 
for the government to prove that the gratuity was given for the purpose of influencing any 
official act. Illegal gratuity violations carry only a maximum two-year term, fine, or both. 
 
The elements of an illegal gratuities offense under section 201(c) are as follows: 
• Giving or receiving 
• Anything of value 
• For or because of 
• An official act 
 
Bribery of a Bank Examiner (18 U.S.C. §§ 212–213) 
Title 18, U.S. Code, sections 212 and 213 forbid the giving of a loan or gratuity “to any 
examiner or assistant examiner who examines or has authority to examine such bank, 
branch, agency, organization, corporation, association or institution …” The only reported 
case construing these statutes held that the prosecution need not prove that the loan or 
gratuity was given or received with a corrupt or wrongful intent. The strict application of the 
statute has been justified by the public’s need for disinterested bank examiners. It is 
important to note that examiner in this context refers to an individual who is appointed by a 
federal financial institution regulatory agency (which is further defined in the statutory 
language), pursuant to state law, or one who is elected under state law to conduct 
examinations of financial institutions. Thus, the term examiner, in this paragraph, should not 
be confused with a fraud examiner.  
 
Bank Bribery (18 U.S.C. § 215) 
Title 18, U.S. Code, section 215 bars the corrupt giving or receiving of anything of value to 
influence the action of an employee or agent of a federally connected financial institution. 
The statute is aimed primarily at reducing corrupt influence in loan making. Unlike sections 
212 and 213 above, a specific intent to influence or be influenced through illegal payment 
must be proven to obtain a conviction. A payment made after a loan has been approved and 
disbursed may be in violation of the law if it is part of a prearranged plan or agreement. 
 
  
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.249 
Anti-Kickback Act of 1986 (41 U.S.C. §§ 51–58) 
The Anti-Kickback Act outlaws the giving or receiving of anything of value for the purpose 
of improperly obtaining or receiving favorable treatment in connection with U.S. 
government contracts. The Act provides both civil and criminal penalties for violations. 
Criminal violations can be punished by a fine, up to 10 years in prison, or both. Civil 
penalties up to twice the amount of the kickback also may be assessed. Additionally, the 
United States may offset the amount of any kickback against the amount owed on the prime 
contract. 
 
ELEMENTS OF ANTI-KICKBACK ACT VIOLATIONS 
Under the Act, it is prohibited for: 
• Any person to 
• Knowingly and willfully 
• Offer or solicit kickbacks or any type of government contract or subcontract 
 
AUDIT OF RECORDS AND PREVENTION PROCEDURES 
The Anti-Kickback Act also provides for inspection by the Inspector General with access to 
books and records, and section 57 requires that the prime contractor have in place in its 
operations reasonable procedures to prevent and detect kickbacks. If a contractor has 
reasonable grounds to believe that there has been a violation, the contractor is required to 
report the possible violation. The contractor also is required to cooperate fully with any 
federal agency investigation. 
 
According to the congressional notes following the statute, “reasonable procedures to detect 
and prevent kickbacks” include: 
• Educational programs for employees and subcontractors 
• Policy manuals 
• Special procurement and audit procedures 
• Ethics policies 
• Applicant screening 
• Reporting procedures 
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1, 78dd-2, 78dd-3, 78m) 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) was originally enacted in 1977 to prohibit certain 
publicly held companies from making corrupt payments to foreign officials or political 
organizations. Other amendments to the Act make it illegal for any U.S. citizen to make such 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.250  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
payments. The statute was the result of disclosures from the Watergate investigations of 
corporate grease payments to foreigners to obtain business overseas.  
 
The FCPA criminalizes the bribery of a foreign public official in order to obtain or retain 
business, and it requires publicly traded companies to keep accurate books and records and 
adopt internal controls to prevent diversion of assets or other improper use of corporate 
funds. 
 
FCPA enforcement actions can include criminal actions by the Department of Justice (DOJ), 
civil actions brought by either the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the DOJ, 
or both, and administrative actions filed by the SEC.  
 
Since the FCPA was enacted, there have been a number of international initiatives to 
strengthen anti-bribery laws around the world. One of the most significant is the work of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD has 30 
member countries, including many of the world’s largest economic powers—the United 
States, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Australia, and the United 
Kingdom. In response to the articles drafted by the OECD, the member countries have or 
are in the process of drafting new, tougher transnational bribery laws. 
 
ANTI-BRIBERY PROVISIONS (15 U.S.C. § 78dd) 
The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA make it unlawful to bribe a foreign official for 
business purposes.  
 
FIVE ELEMENTS  
There are five elements to a violation: (1) regulated party, (2) payment or offer, (3) foreign 
official, (4) corrupt intent, and (5) business purpose.  
 
First, under the FCPA, U.S. jurisdiction over corrupt payments to foreign officials depends 
upon whether the violator is a regulated party. Regulated persons include all of the following: 
• A domestic concern : Any citizen, national, or resident of the United States, or any business 
entity that has its principal place of business in the United States or that is organized 
under the laws of a state, territory, possession, or commonwealth of the United States 
• Issuer : A corporation that has issued securities that have been registered in the United 
States or who is required to file periodic reports with the SEC 
• The agents or other representatives of domestic concerns and issuers 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.251 
• A foreign national or business that takes any act in furtherance of a corrupt payment 
within U.S. territory 
 
Second, the FCPA prohibits paying, offering, promising to pay, or authorizing to pay or 
offer money or anything of value. Under the FCPA, payments can include payments of 
money, gifts, charitable contributions or donation of benefit to foreign official, in-kind 
service, scholarship to foreign official’s relative, overpayments for shares, and loans at 
favorable interest rates. 
 
Third, the prohibition extends only to corrupt payments to a foreign official. The term 
foreign official is very broad and includes: 
• Any foreign department, instrumentality, or agency 
• Any entity owned or controlled by a foreign government 
• Any official or candidate of a foreign political party 
• Any public international organization  
• Any person acting in an official capacity on behalf of any of the above entities 
 
Fourth, the person making or authorizing the payment must have a corrupt intent. That is, 
the payment must be intended to influence the recipient to misuse his position.  
 
Finally, the payment must be related to a specific business purpose. Put differently, the 
payments must be related to obtaining business, retaining business, or directing business. 
The prohibition also covers payments to gain favorable tax or customs treatment or to 
obtain permits or licenses. 
 
CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT OF ANTI-BRIBERY PROVISIONS  
The Department of Justice (DOJ) is responsible  for all criminal enforcement of the FCPA. 
Under the anti-bribery provisions, corporations and other business entities are subject to a 
fine of up to $2,000,000, while  officers, directors, stockholders, employees, and agents are 
subject to a fine of up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to five years. Fines imposed on 
individuals may not be paid by their employer or principal. 
 
CIVIL ENFORCEMENT OF ANTI-BRIBERY PROVISIONS  
Civil enforcement of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA is shared by the Securities 
Exchange Commission (SEC) and the DOJ. The primary civil enforcement tool is an 
injunction, though the FCPA also provides for monetary penalties. The maximum civil 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.252  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
penalty for a violation by any firm, as well as by any officer, director, employee, or agent, is 
$10,000 per occurrence. In addition, in an SEC enforcement action, the court may impose 
an additional fine not to exceed the greater of (1) the gross amount of the pecuniary gain to 
the defendant as a result of the violation, or (2) a specified dollar limitation based on the 
flagrancy of the violation. 
 
ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS (15 U.S.C. § 78m) 
In addition to outlawing bribery payments, the FCPA also contains separate accounting 
provisions for certain entities already subject to the FCPA provisions. Congress enacted the 
FCPA’s accounting provisions as an additional deterrent to bribery based on its conclusion 
that U.S. companies concealed most bribes in their corporate books.  
 
Under the accounting provisions, issuers (i.e., companies with securities listed in the U.S. 
trading markets) must (1) maintain accurate books and records, and (2) adopt internal 
controls to prevent the improper use of corporate funds. 
 
In addition, the FCPA requires that a covered entity make a good-faith effort to ensure that 
any company, including joint ventures, in which the U.S. company or one of its subsidiaries 
holds 50 percent or less of the voting power comply with the FCPA accounting provisions. 
 
BOOKS AND RECORDS (RECORD-KEEPING) PROVISION  
The first major requirement of the accounting provisions is that all issuers must accurately 
record all transactions, keep receipts and other support for transactions, and keep records in 
a manner consistent with overall document retention and record-keeping policies. 
 
In practice, the books and records provisions are used to prevent three types of 
improprieties:  
• The failure to record improper transactions 
• The falsification of records to conceal improper transactions 
• The creation of records that are quantitatively correct, but fail to specify the qualitative 
aspects of a transaction that might reveal the true purpose of a particular payment 
 
  
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.253 
INTERNAL CONTROLS PROVISION  
The internal controls provision is designed to prevent unauthorized or unrecorded 
transactions. Under the internal controls provision, a company must maintain robust 
compliance policies and must take reasonable steps to ensure that its affiliates maintain 
suitable internal controls. 
 
The SEC has considered several factors to determine the adequacy of a system of internal 
controls. The factors include:  
• The role of the board of directors 
• Communication of corporate procedures and policies 
• Assignment of authority and responsibility 
• Competence and integrity of personnel 
• Accountability for performance and compliance with policies and procedures 
• Objectivity and effectiveness of the internal audit function 
 
SEC REGULATIONS REGARDING THE ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS  
The SEC has adopted two regulations enforcing the accounting provisions. First, Rule 13b2-
 1 makes it unlawful to falsify accounts, providing that “[n]o person shall, directly or 
indirectly, falsify or cause to be falsified, any book, record or account” required to be kept 
under the accounting provisions of the FCPA. Second, the SEC established Rule 13b2-2, 
which makes it unlawful to supply false information to auditors. This rule states that:  
 
ENFORCEMENT OF THE ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS  
The FCPA’s accounting provisions are enforced by both the SEC and the DOJ. The SEC 
has authority to initiate civil enforcement actions and can impose civil fines and 
disgorgement on the company and individuals. The SEC has brought enforcement actions of 
the accounting provisions both in cases involving actual foreign bribes and in domestic 
transactions. The SEC can seek civil penalties of up to $500,000 for covered entities and 
$100,000 for individuals. 
 
The DOJ is responsible for criminal prosecution of “willful” violations  of the accounting 
provisions, and criminal penalties can include large fines and imprisonment. A willful 
violation of the accounting and controls provision is punishable by a fine up to $25 million 
against entities, and a fine up to $5 million and imprisonment up to 20 years against 
individuals. 
 
Natural persons convicted of willful violations of the accounting provisions may be fined up  
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.254  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
to $5 million, imprisoned up to 20 years, or both. Corporations convicted of willful 
violations may be fined up to $25 million. Also, the FCPA provides that an individual may 
be held criminally liable for “knowingly” falsifying any book, records, or account, or 
circumventing or failing to implement a system of internal accounting controls. Knowing 
may include willful blindness or conscious attempts not to know. But no criminal liability is 
imposed for technical or insignificant accounting errors.  
 
In addition, administrative and civil relief also is available. A corporation or individual found 
in violation of the FCPA may be subject to debarment before many government agencies, 
and an indictment under the FCPA can also lead to the suspension of one’s right to do 
business with the government or the immediate suspension of export licenses for military 
defense equipment. 
 
Theft or Bribery Concerning Programs Receiving Federal Funds (18 U.S.C. § 666) 
Under this statute, a person can be convicted of a federal offense if he commits fraud or 
theft against a company that receives federal funds. The victim of the theft or bribe must be 
(1) an organization and (2) must receive benefits in excess of $10,000 within any one-year 
period under a federal program involving a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, 
insurance, or other form of federal assistance.  
 
In determining whether the organization receives more than $10,000 in benefits, do not 
include any of the following: salaries, wages, fees, or other compensation paid, or expenses 
paid or reimbursed in the usual course of business. 
 
To sustain a conviction under section 666, the following conditions also must be met: 
• The defendant must be an agent of an organization (as defined above), a state or local 
government, or Native American tribal government 
• Who embezzled, stole, or otherwise obtained by fraud 
• Property valued at $5,000 or more 
• The property is owned or is under the care or custody of the organization or agency 
• The organization or agency must receive more than $10,000 in federal funding 
 
The statute also makes it a federal crime to solicit, offer, or accept (or agree to offer or 
accept) bribes in relation to any transactions involving the federally funded organization or 
agency if the transaction is valued at $5,000 or more. 
 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.255 
Federal Securities Laws 
Because of several high profile corporate scandals in 2001 and 2002, Congress passed the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was discussed previously in this chapter. In addition to the 
numerous reporting and certification requirements for financial statements, the Act also 
created a criminal statute relating to securities fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1348) set forth below. In 
addition to this statute, there are also numerous other federal statutes which prohibit false 
statements and other fraudulent activity in connection with securities transactions. The most 
commonly used are section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (popularly known as the 1933 
Act) and Rule 10b-5, promulgated under section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (the 1934 Act). Both contain civil and administrative remedies (such as the power to 
initiate actions to enjoin further violations) enforced by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC), as well as criminal sanctions enforced by the Department of Justice 
(DOJ). Whether a particular violation is pros ecuted civilly or criminally depends in large 
measure on the degree of willfulness that can be proved. 
 
The 1933 and 1934 Acts 
Section 17(a) of the 1933 Act makes it unlawful to employ fraudulent devices or 
misrepresentations in connection with the offer or sale of securities through jurisdictional 
facilities (e.g., the U.S. mail), whereas Rule 10b-5 prohibits the same conduct “in 
connection” with the “purchase or sale” of any security by “any person.” Because Rule 10b-
 5 has the broadest reach — including insider trading — it is the most often used.  
 
More specifically, a successful 10b-5 action requires the plaintiff to allege and prove the 
following four elements: 
• The defendant made a material misstatement or omission 
• The defendant acted with scienter (typically meaning that the party charged with the 
violation acted with a specific intent to defraud) 
• The plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation or omission in the purchase or sale of a 
security 
• The plaintiff suffered economic loss caused by the purchase or sale of the security 
 
To bring a successful insider trading claim under Rule 10b-5, however, the government must 
prove all of the following elements: 
• The defendant bought or sold securities in a company. 
• At the time of purchase, the defendant was in possession of non-public, material 
information.  
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.256  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• The defendant was an insider of the company (e.g., an employee), a “constructive 
insider” (i.e., someone who is temporarily en trusted with confidential information), a 
tippee (i.e., someone who receives information from an insider), or an outsider who gets 
the information from a temporary insider.  
• The defendant traded “by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate 
commerce or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange.” 
 
To allow action under Rule 10b-5, the false statement must be material. The test for 
materiality is whether there is a substantial likelihood under all the circumstances that a 
reasonable investor would have considered the misstated or omitted facts significant in 
deciding whether to invest. Materiality is most often expressed in dollar terms or in terms of 
its effect on financial statements. Materiality, however, might relate to serious questions of 
management’s integrity regardless of the dollar amount involved. 
 
Specific intent to defraud is an essential element of a violation of section 17(a) and Rule 10b-
 5. However, intent to defraud  is defined more broadly in securities regulations than in other 
areas of common-law fraud, and it includes reckless statements, as well as the knowing 
circulation of half-truths and false opinions or predictions that elsewhere might be 
considered non-actionable puffing. To prove liability against a corporation, a plaintiff must 
show that an agent of the corporation made the alleged false statements with specific intent 
to defraud, and both the fraudulent act and required mental state are attributable to the 
corporation. 
 
Good faith is always a defense to a section 17(a) or Rule 10b-5 fraud action. However, intent 
can be — and usually is — proved by circumstantial evidence, as in any fraud case. Violations 
of other indirect anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws (such as certain 
registrations and disclosure requirements) do not require a showing of fraudulent intent. 
 
SEC civil actions often are settled by consent decrees in which the party agrees to stop the 
offending practice without admitting or denying he engaged in it in the first place. Violations 
of such decrees may be punishable as contempt with jail terms or fines.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act passed in June 2002 made a number of important changes to 
securities law. One of the most significant changes was the addition of a criminal offense 
under section 807 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 13 48).  Section 1348 provides for fines up to 
$250,000, imprisonment for up to 25 years, or both.  
 
The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA), signed into law by President 
Obama on May 20, 2009, contains a number of measures intended to combat fraud. Among 
other provisions, the legislation expands the definition of securities fraud in section 1348 to 
include fraud schemes involving commodities for future delivery or options on commodities 
for future delivery. 
 
Tax Evasion, False Returns, and Failure to File  
(26 U.S.C. §§ 7201, 7203, 7206[1], et. seq.) 
Fraud and corruption prosecutions might include tax evasion, false returns, or failure to file 
counts if — as is often the case — the recipient of illegal payments has not reported them as 
income, or if the payer has attempted to conceal and deduct them as a legitimate business 
expense. 
 
Offshore Tax Avoidance and Evasion  
Even though offshore banking is not illegal, federal law requires individuals to disclose any 
offshore accounts to the U.S. government. Generally, the principal disclosure requirement is 
satisfied by filing Treasury Form 90-22.1, the “Report of Foreign Bank and Financial 
Accounts” (FBAR). Specifically, Treasury Department regulations require U.S. citizens and 
resident aliens to file a report when they maintain a financial interest or signature authority 
over a foreign bank account with a balance of more than $10,000 during the calendar year. 
Furthermore, individuals with reportable offshore accounts must acknowledge whether they 
have an offshore account on their tax return.  
 
Violation of these reporting requirements may be  punished by civil or criminal penalties. 
Section 5321 of the Bank Secrecy Act sets forth the civil penalties for noncompliance, 
providing that a covered entity that willfully violates the above reporting requirements can 
be hit with a penalty of up to the amount of the transaction (not to exceed $100,000) or 
$25,000, whichever is greater. In addition, civil tax penalties may be imposed for failing to 
disclose foreign account activity.  
 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.258  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Generally, tax evasion, (26 U.S.C. § 7201), failure to file a return or pay a tax (26 U.S.C. § 
7203), and making a false tax return (26 U.S.C. § 7206(1)) are the most common criminal 
offenses arising from holding a foreign account. Section 7201 carries a felony charge of not 
more than $100,000 ($500,000 in the case of a corporation) and/or imprisonment for not 
more than five years. A person convicted under section 7203 can be fined up to $100,000 or 
sentenced to up to one year in prison in addition to any other penalties. A person found 
guilty of section 7206 may be subject to a fine of up to $100,000 (or $500,000 in the case of 
a corporation) and/or imprisonment of up to three years.  
 
Recently, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have 
intensified crackdowns on offshore bank accounts, attempting to locate and punish 
individuals that use offshore bank accounts to illegally shield income. This development has 
occurred primarily because offshore tax havens result in lost revenue for the U.S. 
government. In fact, according to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, 
offshore tax evasion costs the United States an estimated $100 billion in lost revenue each 
year.  
 
Bankruptcy Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 151, et seq.) 
Two related but somewhat different types of criminal conduct fall under the general heading 
of bankruptcy fraud. The first is the planned bankruptcy  or bustout  scheme in which the 
wrongdoer sells off for cash, usually below cost, inventory obtained on credit (often through 
false or inflated financial statements) and then absconds with the proceeds. Formal 
bankruptcy proceedings often are not initiated and the crime may be prosecuted under 
general fraud statutes, such as mail or wire fraud.  
 
The second type of bankruptcy offense involves misconduct by a person or entity actually 
involved or contemplating being involved in a formal bankruptcy proceeding. The federal 
criminal laws that regulate bankruptcy proceedings are set out in the Financial Transactions 
section of the Fraud Examiners Manual. 
 
Financial Institution Fraud 
This section examines some common federal statutes that prohibit fraud against banks or 
other similar financial institutions. 
 
  
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.259 
Bank Fraud (18 U.S.C. §§ 1344, 1345) 
Title 18, U.S. Code, section 1344 is the broadest of all bank fraud statutes. It punishes those 
obtaining assets owned or controlled by a bank by false or fraudulent pretenses, 
representations, or promises. It covers both insiders and all other persons, even if not 
affiliated with the bank. It also applies to check kiting and to offshore frauds (extraterritorial 
reach). Bank fraud is a predicate offense under the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt 
Organization statute. Penalties for bank fraud include a fine of up to $1,000,000 and/or 
imprisonment of up to 30 years.  
 
In a related provision, section 1345 allows the government to commence a civil action in 
federal court to enjoin fraudulent activity that violates section 1344. 
 
As in the mail and wire fraud statutes, the terms scheme and artifice to defraud include any 
misrepresentations or other conduct intended to deceive others to obtain something of 
value. The prosecution must prove only an attempt to execute the scheme. It need not show 
actual loss, that the victim institution was deceived, or that the defendant personally 
benefited from the scheme. 
 
Fraud by Bank Personnel and Receivers  
FALSE ENTRIES (18 U.S.C. § 1006) 
Section 1006 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code is a typical conflict of interest prohibition. It 
makes it a crime for “officers, agents, or employees” of financial institutions to defraud 
financial institutions or the U.S. government by making false entries or withdrawing or 
transferring funds without authorization. The penalties are severe — up to 30 years in prison 
and/or a fine of up to $1,000,000. 
 
To prove illegal participation under section 1006, the government must prove: 
• The defendant was an officer, agent, or employee of a lending institution authorized by 
and acting under the laws of the United States 
• Direct or indirect receipt of some benefit from the transaction in question 
• The defendant knowingly and willfully made, or caused to be made, a false entry 
concerning a material fact in a book, report, or statement of the institution 
 
CONCEALMENT OF ASSETS FROM A RECEIVER (18 U.S.C. § 1032) 
Section 1032 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code makes it a crime for a conservator or receiver of a 
financial institution to conceal or impede the recovery of funds or property. 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.260  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
THEFT, EMBEZZLEMENT, AND MISAPPLI CATION (18 U.S.C. §§ 656, 657) 
Section 656 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code is the principal federal bank embezzlement statute. 
It prohibits theft, embezzlement, and misapplication of a bank’s funds by its officers, 
directors, or employees. The essential elements of a typical section 656 violation are: 
• The defendant was an officer, director, agent, or employee of 
• A federally insured bank 
• Who willfully 
• Embezzled, abstracted, purloined, or willfully misapplied funds of the bank 
• With the intent to injure or defraud the bank 
 
The terms abstract, purloin, and misapply as used in the statute are largely repetitive and in 
normal usage mean to take or to convert bank funds for one’s own use or the use of a third-
 party for improper purposes without the bank’s knowledge or consent.  
 
Section 657 prohibits the embezzlement of funds from designated federally connected 
lending, credit, and insurance organizations. The basic elements of a violation are the same 
as those in section 656. 
 
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) (12 U.S.C. § 1811, et. seq.) 
Following the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, Congress passed the Financial Institutions 
Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) to enhance the safety of savings 
institutions. Among other things, FIRREA greatly strengthened the government’s 
prosecutorial arm against insiders and outsiders. The law’s provisions are applicable to any 
institution-affiliated party, which includes (but is not limited to) directors, officers, 
employees, and controlling shareholders. Institution-affiliated parties can include attorneys, 
accountants, and appraisers. 
 
FIRREA provides for enhanced penalties for convictions of several bank-related statutes. 
Under FIRREA, civil penalties range from $1 million per day, a total of $5 million for 
continuing violations, or the amount of wrongful gain or loss.  
 
Financial Institutions Anti-Fraud Enforcement Act of 1990 (12 U.S.C. § 4201, et. seq.) 
The Financial Institutions Anti-Fraud Enforcement Act is also directed at the financial 
services industry. This Act allows private informants to notify the government about 
violations that could give rise to civil actions under FIRREA, and it provides for private civil 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.261 
enforcement in certain situations. The statute also allows for the hiring of private counsel to 
investigate and prosecute civil claims. 
 
Continuing Financial Crime Enterprise Statute (18 U.S.C. § 225) 
Also known as the “S&L Kingpin” statute or the “Financial Crime Kingpin Statute,” 
Congress enacted this law in response to the late 1980s savings and loan scandal, in which 
numerous factors such as market forces and criminal activity within saving and loan 
institutions led to the collapse of the savings and loan industry. Primarily concerned with 
punishing financial institution related crimes, the Financial Crime Kingpin Statute 
criminalizes the administration of a continuing financial crimes enterprise.  
 
A criminal enterprise is a series of violations of enumerated crimes related to financial 
institutions that were committed by at least four persons acting in concert. According to 
most courts, a series is three violations. 
 
Punishment under the Financial Crime Kingpin Statute is severe. The law provides for fines 
of up to $20 million for organizational defendan ts, as well as fines of up to $10 million and 
up to life imprisonment for individual defendants receiving $5,000,000 or more during a 24-month 
period from a criminal enterprise.  
 
Participation in the Affairs of a Financial Institution by a Convicted Felon (12 U.S.C. § 1829) 
This statute prohibits people convicted of certain banking crimes from participating in the 
conduct of the affairs of a financial institution, with certain exceptions. A knowing violation 
might result in fines of up to $1 million for each day the prohibition is violated, 
imprisonment of up to five years, or both. 
 
Fraudulent Use of Credit Cards (15 U.S.C. § 1644) 
The federal government uses several different statutes to prosecute credit card fraud, 
including section 1644 of the Truth in Lending Act, the mail fraud statute, and the wire 
fraud statutes. But of these three statutes, only section 1644 is specifically designed to 
combat credit card fraud.   
 
Section 1644 of the Truth in Lending Act provides penalties for the use of counterfeit, 
fictitious, altered, forged, lost, stolen, or fraudulently obtained credit cards. Specifically, 
section 1644 prohibits an individual from using a fraudulently obtained credit card to obtain 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.262  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
money, goods, services, or anything else of value aggregating $1,000 or more. It also 
prohibits a person from receiving, concealing, using, or transporting anything of value that 
was “obtained with a counterfeit, fictitious, altered, forged, lost, stolen, or fraudulently 
obtained credit card.” A violator can be fined up to $10,000 and/or imprisoned for up to 10 
years. 
 
The Electronic Funds Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. § 1693n(b)) 
Congress designed this legislation to allow consumers the ease and benefit of electronic fund 
transfers, while defining the rights and liabilities of the parties involved in such transactions. 
Section 1693n applies to paperless money transfers between accounts, including ATM 
transactions, debit and credit card transactions, point-of-sale (POS) debit transactions, 
telephone transfers, and according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), 
any “other electronic banking transactions that can result in the withdrawal of cash from 
your bank account.” 
 
Generally, this statute attaches criminal liability to the acts of: 
• Giving false or inaccurate information under the banking laws and regulations 
• Failing to provide information required under the banking laws and regulations 
 
Section 1693n also prohibits certain actions affecting commerce, including: 
• Using, attempting to use, or conspiring to use any fraudulently obtained debit 
instrument, with knowledge of fraudulent character, to obtain anything with an 
aggregating value of at least $1,000 within a one-year period 
• Transporting, attempting to transport, or conspiring to transport a fraudulent debit 
instrument with unlawful or fraudulent intent and knowledge 
• Selling or transporting in interstate or foreign commerce of any fraudulent debit 
instrument with knowledge 
• Receiving, concealing, using, or transporting any proceeds from a fraudulent activity that 
have a value exceeding $1,000 within any one-year period 
• Receiving, concealing, using, selling, or transporting of one or more tickets for interstate 
or foreign transportation that have a value aggregating $500 or more and were obtained 
by use of a fraudulent debit instrument 
• Furnishing money, property, services, or anything else of value aggregating $1,000 or 
more within a one-year period, in conjunction with the use of a fraudulent debit 
instrument 
 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.263 
As used in this section, the term debit instrument means a card, code, or other device other 
than a check, draft, or similar paper instrument, by the use of which a person may initiate an 
electronic fund transfer. 
 
Laws Relating to Health Care Fraud 
Health care fraud may be defined as an intentional act to defraud a health care benefit program 
or to obtain through false representations money or other property owned by a health care 
benefit program. Numerous criminal and civil federal and state laws are available in the 
prosecution of health care fraud. In addition, regulatory agencies are also available for 
licensure action.  
 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
As part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), 
Congress made a number of changes to the federal criminal code. The Act established 
several criminal statutes related specifically to health care fraud. Specifically, under HIPAA, 
there are five federal crimes directed at health care fraud. 
 
HIPAA made it illegal for anyone to knowingly and willfully: 
• Defraud any health care benefit program or obtain by means of false representations any 
money or property of a health care benefit program (18 U.S.C. § 1347) 
• Embezzle, convert, or steal any funds, property, or assets of a health care benefit 
program (18 U.S.C. § 669) 
• Make “false statements,” which criminalizes any false or fictitious statements “in any 
matter involving a health care benefit program” (18 U.S.C. § 1035) 
• Obstruct, delay, prevent, or mislead the investigation of federal health care offenses (18 U.S.C. § 1518) 
 
The term health care benefit program as used in these statutes is defined to mean “any public or 
private plan or contract, affecting commerce, under which any medical benefit, item, or 
service is provided to any individual, and includes any individual or entity who is providing a 
medical benefit, item, or service for which payment may be made under the plan or 
contract” (18 U.S.C. § 24(b)). 
 
HIPAA also provides that a judge may order a person convicted of a federal health care 
offense to forfeit any property that can be traced from the proceeds received from the 
offense. 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.264  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
For information on HIPAA’s privacy protections for consumers’ health care information,  
see the Identity Theft section below.  
 
False Claims and Statements  
In addition to HIPAA, the federal false claims statutes, including the criminal False Claims 
Act, false statements under section 1001, and the Civil False Claims Act, may be used to 
combat certain types of health care fraud.  
 
These statutes are discussed in more detail in the False Claims and Statements section below.  
 
Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)) 
Also, the anti-kickback statute (also referred to in the healthcare industry as the Medicare-Medicaid 
Anti-Fraud and Abuse Statute) may be used to combat healthcare fraud. This 
statute prohibits an individual from making payments to induce the purchase of healthcare 
goods or services that will be paid for by a federal health care program.  
 
A violation of the anti-kickback statute carries criminal fines of up to $25,000 per violation, 
imprisonment for up to five years, and exclusion from participation in federal health care 
programs. The government may also impose civil penalties, which could result in treble 
damages plus $50,000 for each violation. 
 
The Stark Law (42 U.S.C. 1395nn) 
The Stark Law (also known as the physician self-referral law) attempts to limit the ability of 
physicians to profit from their referrals by prohibiting physicians from making referrals of 
certain designated health services (DHS) to entities with which the physician or his 
immediate family member has a financial relationship. The DHS include physical therapy 
services; occupational therapy services; radiology and ultrasound services; durable medical 
equipment and supplies; parental and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies; prosthetics, 
orthotic, and prosthetic devices; home health services and supplies; outpatient prescription 
drugs; and hospital services.  
 
In contrast to the Anti-Kickback Statute, which is a criminal statute that targets a wide range 
of transactions, the Stark Law is a civil law that specifically targets physician referrals. 
 
An individual who violates the Stark Law can incur civil penalties and be excluded from 
participation in federal health care programs.   
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.265 
Identity Theft  
Technological advancements facilitating the electronic transfer of personal and financial 
information have greatly contributed to the increasing occurrences of identity theft. Identity 
theft occurs when thieves wrongfully obtain and use another person’s personal data (i.e., 
name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, or credit card numbers) in a way that 
involves fraud or deception. There are two primary federal laws that address identity theft: 
the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act and the Identity Theft Penalty 
Enhancement Act. In addition, there are a number of state, federal, and regulatory data 
breach laws that require companies to inform consumers of data breaches without 
unreasonable delay.  
 
There are, however, other ancillary federal laws regarding fraud in various contexts that this 
section will not cover. These ancillary laws include the federal mail and wire fraud statutes, 
the access device fraud statute, federal statutes that prohibit fraud against banks or other 
similar financial institutions, and statutes prohibiting Social Security fraud. 
 
Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 (18 U.S.C. § 1028) 
The growth of identity theft led Congress to pass the Identity Theft and Assumption 
Deterrence Act, which makes identity theft a federal crime. The Identity Theft and 
Assumption Deterrence Act (outlaws the intentional and unauthorized use of another 
individual’s identification, with the intent to commit a crime. The Act carries a maximum 
term of 15 years of imprisonment, a fine, and criminal forfeiture of any personal property 
used or intended to be used to commit the offense. (The penalty is increased to a maximum 
of 30 years of imprisonment if the offense is committed to facilitate an act of terrorism.) 
Identity theft schemes may also involve other violations such as mail fraud, wire fraud, credit 
card fraud, computer fraud, or financial institution fraud. 
 
In addition, this legislation enables the Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
and other law enforcement agencies to combat this crime. It allows the identity theft victim 
to seek restitution if there is a conviction. It also establishes the Federal Trade Commission 
as a central agency to act as a clearinghouse for complaints (against credit reporting agencies 
and credit grantors), referrals, and resources for assistance for victims of identity theft.  
 
Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act (18 U.S.C. § 1028A) 
In August 2004, Congress passed the Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act to deal with 
the increasing frequency of identity theft schemes. This Act strengthens federal law on 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.266  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
identity theft by creating a crime of “aggravated identity theft.” Aggravated identity theft 
occurs when an individual uses a stolen identity to commit other crimes. Specifically, section 
1028A provides that where one “knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful 
authority, a means of identification of another” during and in relation to any felony violation 
of/or relating to fraud, embezzlement, false statements, and the like, an additional term of 
imprisonment of two years will be imposed on the individual. In April 2005, the United 
States Sentencing Commission went a step further to impose consecutive mandatory 
minimum sentences of two and five years depending on the underlying offense of misusing a 
stolen identification. The statute also imposes a minimal sentence of two years of 
imprisonment to any punishment for a felony crime committed using a stolen identity. 
 
Data Breaches and Breach Notification Laws 
Businesses with inadequate security safeguards not only leave customers’ confidential data 
vulnerable to misuse or theft, but also increase their risk of regulatory or legal action, direct 
economic loss, and loss of consumer confidence. 
 
EXAMPLE  
In September 2009, TJX Companies (the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, 
HomeGoods, and other enterprises) agreed to pay $525,000 to settle a class-action suit filed by 
several banks related to the data breach of its computer system in which hackers compromised 
94 million credit and debit card numbers. According to investigations, inadequate security 
safeguards allowed hackers to access and steal this information. This settlement is one of several 
for TJX, which has estimated that it will spend more than $250 million to address network-security 
weaknesses and respond to lawsuits, investigations, and other claims stemming from the 
breach. 
 
EXAMPLE  
On November 20, 2009, the Hartford Courant reported that Health Net, a health insurance 
provider, lost a portable, external hard drive with unencrypted personal information of 
approximately 1.5 million customers. The missing data included Social Security numbers and 
bank account numbers of Health Net members in Arizona, Connecticut, New Jersey, and 
New York. Although the hard drive reportedly disappeared from Health Net’s office in May 
2009, the company waited six months before disclosing the breach. According to the 
Connecticut Attorney General, Health Net may be in violation of state notification laws that 
require companies to inform consumers of data breaches without unreasonable delay. 
 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.267 
Data breaches are one of the largest contributors to the escalating problem of identity theft, 
which costs Americans more than $50 billion each year. In fact, the Identity Theft Resource 
Center, a nonprofit organization dedicated to understanding and preventing identity theft, 
estimates that in 2008, data breaches left more than 35 million personal records exposed. 
 
Although these cases and statistics illustrate why strengthening information-security practices 
should become a high priority for management in all types of organizations, complying with 
U.S. privacy laws and regulations is becoming increasingly complex. This is primarily because 
the United States uses a sectoral approach to protect information. This approach, which 
relies on a mix of legislation, regulation, and self-regulation, creates a system in which 
privacy standards emerge from a complex interplay of overlapping state and federal laws and 
regulations, as well as industry practices.  
 
In addition to a complex regulatory framework, organizations across various industries have 
experienced a significant increase in the number of information privacy laws and regulations 
affecting their operations. Particularly due to an onslaught of data-breach stories like the 
ones above, concerns about the privacy of personal information have escalated, and this has 
compelled government authorities to enact stronger consumer-protection legislation and 
enhance enforcement efforts to identify and prosecute violations of laws protecting private-
 consumer information. 
 
Although businesses have become subject to a growing number of privacy laws and 
regulations, information-privacy regulation in the United States is more prevalent in areas 
where abuses of personal information are most likely to occur, such as the financial and 
health care industries.  
 
This increasingly complex area of law poses significant compliance challenges for 
organizations operating in regulated industries. In this environment, management must 
understand the complicated and expanding area of privacy law and continually work to 
ensure that their organizations have and follow appropriate procedures and protocols 
addressing information privacy. 
 
This section seeks to provide a general overview on the subject by briefly examining some 
important laws, regulations, and standards designed to protect the privacy, security, and 
confidentiality of customer data. The discussion below is divided into the following  
  
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.268  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
categories: financial privacy, private health in formation, and privacy protections applying to 
businesses in other industries. 
 
PRIVATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
Privacy protections in the financial services industry are primarily contained in the Fair and 
Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.  
 
FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT’S RED FLAG RULES  
In 2007, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued final rules and guidelines (Red Flag 
Rules) implementing sections 114 and 315 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act 
(FACTA).The Red Flag Rules require financial institutions and certain creditors to develop 
and implement a formal written program to identify, detect, and respond to red flags of 
possible identity theft. 
 
See the chapter on “Financial Institution Fraud” in the Financial Transactions and Fraud 
Schemes section of the Fraud Examiners Manual for more information about the Red Flag 
Rules. 
 
GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT  
Like FACTA’s Red Flag Rules, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which protects customers’ 
financial information held by banks working in personal finance, imposes privacy obligations 
on financial institutions. Specifically, financial institutions have privacy obligations under the 
Financial Privacy Rule and the Safeguards Rule of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. 
 
The Financial Privacy Rule requires financial institutions to provide their customers with 
privacy notices explaining the institution’s policies for collecting and sharing personal 
financial information. The Financial Privacy Rule also applies to companies — whether or not 
they are financial institutions — that receive personal financial information. 
 
Conversely, the Safeguards Rule requires all financial institutions to design, implement, and 
maintain safeguards to protect the confidentiality and integrity of customers’ personal 
information. The Safeguards Rule applies not only to financial institutions that collect 
information from their own customers, but also to financial institutions that receive 
customer information from other financial institutions.

PRIVATE HEALTH INFORMATION 
In addition, certain businesses may need to consider adopting a set of policies and 
procedures to safeguard private health information, which includes any identifiable 
information that relates to a patient’s health, health care, or payment for health care. Federal 
privacy protections for consumers’ health care information are primarily located in the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information 
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act). 
 
THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT  
Although Congress originally enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA) to protect health insurance coverage for workers and their families, it 
expanded the law to protect patient health information. The HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to 
health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses that electronically transmit 
health information in connection with a covered transaction, and it governs access to and 
use of “protected health information,” which includes any identifiable information that 
relates to a patient’s health, health care, or payment for health care. 
 
The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally provides that covered entities cannot use or disclose any 
protected health information except as authorized by the subject of that information or as 
specifically required or authorized by the regulations. It also provides that when the use or 
disclosure of such information is permitted, covered entities must make all reasonable efforts 
to use or disclose the minimum amount of protected information necessary to accomplish 
the intended purpose.  
 
If protected health information becomes an issue during a fraud examination, the examiner 
should immediately contact the human resources (HR) department. The HR department 
should have information about whether the entity is subject to HIPAA rules and can help 
the examiner comply with those rules.  
 
The most important thing to note is that if HIPAA rules do apply, examiners are restricted 
as to the type of health information they can access without specific written authorization. 
Examiners should never contact the health care provider, the health-plan administrator, or a 
medical-billing service for copies of employee’s records without first consulting the 
employer’s legal counsel or HR department.

2.270  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
THE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR ECONOMIC AND CLINICAL HEALTH ACT  
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), which was enacted on 
February 17, 2009, contains many compliance challenges for entities that create, maintain, 
disclose, or use health information. Title XIII of ARRA, the Health Information Technology 
for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), imposed additional requirements for 
notifications of federal security breaches and added numerous privacy and data security 
restrictions for covered entities under HIPAA. The act also increased the maximum fine 
under HIPAA from $100,000 to $1,500,000. 
 
BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL AND HEALTH CARE INDUSTRIES 
Even if managers believe their companies fall outside of the financial services or health care 
industries, they should determine if they are creditors under the Red Flag Rules and look to 
state laws and industry standards, especially the Payment Card Industry’s Data Security 
Standard (PCI DSS). 
 
STATE PRIVACY LAWS  
In addition to the federal laws summarized above, specific state laws may regulate the 
collection and use of personal information by businesses in the private sector. During the 
past few years, states have been aggressive in creating protections for personal information, 
and these protections typically apply to a broad set of personal information and extend to all 
businesses operating in the state.  
 
Of particular concern for businesses are state laws pertaining to breach notification. Most 
states have responded to the escalating number of security breaches by enacting these laws, 
which typically require businesses to notify their customers of a security breach involving 
personal information.  
 
Although most states’ breach-notification laws contain similar provisions, they contain 
varying definitions of personal information and require different types of notification. 
Therefore, before establishing new policies and practices concerning the handling of  
  
                                                 
2As of April 12, 2010, 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have enacted 
legislation requiring notification of security breaches involving personal information. For a list of state breach 
notification laws, visit the National Conference of State Legislatures website at www.ncsl.org.   
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.271 
personal information, management should consult with legal counsel to identify what laws 
apply.  
 
PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY’S DATA SECURITY STANDARD  
In addition to state laws, management must be aware of its industry-specific data security 
standards, such as the Payment Card Industry’s Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), one of 
the most important private-industry data-security standards. 
 
Developed by the five major credit card companies (American Express, Discover, JCB, 
MasterCard, and Visa) to prevent security issues, the PCI DSS is a comprehensive set of 
security due diligence practices to help ensure the safe handling of payment card data. All 
companies that store, process, or transmit credit or debit card data must comply with this set 
of standards. 
 
The PCI DSS framework comprises the following 12 security requirements: 
• Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data. 
• Do not use vendor-supplied defaults of system passwords and other security parameters. 
• Protect stored cardholder data. 
• Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks. 
• Use and regularly update anti-virus software or programs. 
• Develop and maintain secure systems and applications. 
• Restrict access to cardholder data on a need-to-know basis. 
• Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access. 
• Restrict physical access to cardholder data. 
• Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data. 
• Regularly test security systems and processes. 
• Maintain a policy that addresses information security for employees and contractors. 
 
Failure to comply with PCI DSS can result in severe consequences imposed by the card 
brands, including: 
• Fines up to $500,000 per data breach if data is compromised 
• Fines up to $25,000 per month until compliance is obtained 
• Liability for all fraud losses incurred from compromised account numbers 
• Loss of ability to process payment card transactions 
 
And while the federal government has not mandated compliance with the PCI DSS, some 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.272  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
state laws force elements of the PCI DSS into law, and several states have considered 
amending their breach-notification laws to include liability for an organization’s failure to 
adopt certain safeguards required by the PCI DSS.  
 
Laws Relating to Government Contracting 
Government contracting refers to the acquisition of goods or services by the federal 
government at the best possible value. Since the primary objective of an effective 
procurement policy is achieving the best value of money, it is important that the 
procurement process avoid incidences of fraud. 
 
The U.S. legal system provides for both private and public remedies for procurement fraud. 
Fraudulent conduct related to the procurement process may be challenged by federal 
prosecutors, state prosecutors, or private parties who have been injured by the fraudulent 
conduct and have standing to sue.  
 
This section examines relevant statutes used to prosecute contract fraud and applicable civil 
remedies used to recover damages for fraudulent activity. The following federal statutes may 
be used to combat contracting fraud:  
• False Claims and Statements  
• Mail Fraud and Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343) 
• Bribery, Gratuities, and Conflicts of Interest, Generally (18 U.S.C. §§ 201–208) 
• Anti-Kickback Act of 1986 (41 U.S.C. §§ 51–58) 
• Procurement Integrity Act (41 U.S.C. § 423)  
• The Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 (15 U.S.C. §§ 12–27, 52–53)  
• Truth in Negotiations Act (10 U.S.C. § 2306) 
• Federal Acquisition Regulation  
 
False Claims and Statements Statutes  
As previously discussed, Chapter 47 of Title 18, U.S. Code contains a number of related 
provisions that punish false or fraudulent statements made to various federal agencies and 
departments, including 18 U.S.C. § 1001, the criminal false claims act (18 U.S.C. § 287), the 
civil false claims act (18 U.S.C. § 3729), and the Major Fraud Act of 1988 (18 U.S.C. § 1031). 
 
  
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.273 
FALSE STATEMENTS (18 U.S.C. § 1001) 
The principle federal false statement statute is located in section 1001 of Title 18, U.S. Code. 
Section 1001 prohibits false or fraudulent statements, orally or in writing, made to various 
federal agencies and departments.  
 
CRIMINAL FALSE CLAIMS ACT (18 U.S.C. § 287) 
Frequently referred to as the Criminal False Claims Act, section 287 makes it illegal to 
present or make any false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim against any agency or department of 
the United States. The crime is complete when the claim is presented and payment of the 
claim is not an element of the offense.  
 
CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT (31 U. S.C. § 3729 et seq.) 
The Civil False Claims Act is the civil counterpart to the Criminal False Claims Act. It 
provides a separate civil cause of action that may be taken in addition to a criminal 
prosecution. As a result, the submission of a false claim to the government can make a 
contractor liable to the government, both criminally and civilly. 
 
The False Claims Act provides in part that a person who commits the following acts is liable 
to the government for any treble damages it sustains and a civil penalty of $5,000 to $10,000 
per false claim. 
 
In addition to allowing the government to recover penalties and damages for false claims, 
the Civil False Claims Act allows a private party to prosecute a civil action against the 
perpetrator(s) on behalf of the government. This is called a qui tam action and is discussed 
in further detail below.  
 
MAJOR FRAUD ACT OF 1988 (18 U.S.C. § 1031) 
The Major Fraud Act prohibits any scheme to de fraud the United States or obtain money or 
property from the United States by means of false or fraudulent pretenses involving 
procurement contracts worth $1 million or more.  
 
To establish a claim under the Major Fraud Act, the government must show the following 
elements:  
• The defendant knowingly executed or attempted to execute 
• Any scheme or artifice  
• With the intent to defraud the United States or to obtain money by false pretenses 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.274  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• On a contract with the United States valued at $1 million or more 
 
The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA), signed into law by President 
Obama on May 20, 2009, contains a number of measures intended to combat fraud. Among 
other significant changes, FERA amends section 1031 to cover fraud in connection with 
funds provided under the Troubled Asset Relief Program and other governmental economic 
stimulus or recovery programs.  
 
If convicted, the defendant may be imprisoned for up to 10 years and fined up to $10 
million or twice the amount of the gross loss or gain involved in the offense. The statute 
contains a special seven-year statute of limitations compared to the normal five-year statute 
applicable to federal crimes. 
 
The statute also contains a whistleblower protection clause. This clause provides that any 
individual who is discharged, demoted, harassed, or otherwise mistreated as a result of the 
individual’s cooperation in the prosecution of offenses under this section may obtain 
reinstatement, two times the amount of back pay due, and other damages, including litigation 
costs and attorney’s fees. 
 
Another provision authorizes the attorney general to pay up to $250,000 in certain 
circumstances for information regarding possible prosecutions under this section. This and 
the whistleblower provisions do not apply to people who participated in the offense. 
 
Mail Fraud and Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343) 
These laws, which are broad enough to apply to many instances of contracting fraud, 
prohibit the use of mail or wires, including the Internet, in furtherance of a fraudulent 
scheme designed to obtain money or property. Procurement and contract fraud schemes 
that have been prosecuted under the mail fraud statute include: 
• False representation of material facts 
• False claims 
• Official bribery 
• Commercial bribery and kickbacks 
• Conflicts of interest 
 
See the “Mail Fraud and Wire Fraud” section for more information.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.275 
Bribery, Gratuities, and Conflicts of Interest, Generally (18 U.S.C. §§ 201–208) 
These statutes prohibit a wide variety of activities which can be described generally as 
corruption. Such activities include giving or receiving a bribe or gratuity to or from a public 
official, as well as engaging in a conflict of interest. Section 201 is the principal federal anti-
 corruption statute. It applies to virtually any U.S. official and contains two separate offenses: 
bribery of public officials and illegal gratuities. In relation, section 208 prohibits a federal 
government employee from acting on a matter in which he has a conflict of interest. See the 
“Federal Corruption Statutes” section for more information. 
 
BRIBERY OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS (18 U.S.C. § 201(B)) 
In general, section 201(b) prohibits giving or receiving something of value for the purpose of 
influencing the performance of an official act. Bribery is punishable by up to 15 years 
imprisonment, fines, and disqualification from holding public office.  
 
GRATUITIES (18 U.S.C. § 201(C)) 
Gratuities include giving a government employee something of value because of his official 
position. However, unlike the bribery offense, there is no requirement for the government to 
prove that the gratuity was given for the purpose of influencing any official act. Illegal 
gratuity violations carry only a maximum two-year term, fine, or both. 
 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST (18 U.S.C. § 208) 
This statute prohibits those situations in which a government employee engages in activities 
that create a conflict between his personal interests and his duty to protect and serve the 
interests of the government. Violations of section 208 can result in civil penalties for the 
government employee (not exceeding $50,000 per violation, as well as two times the amount 
of compensation he received or was offered) and the government contractor (not exceeding 
$500,000 per violation in addition to two times the amount of compensation the contractor 
received or offered). It also imposes criminal penalties (up to five years imprisonment 
and/or a fine).  
 
Anti-Kickback Act of 1986 (41 U.S.C. §§ 51–58) 
The Anti-Kickback Act prohibits government contractors from soliciting, accepting, or 
attempting to solicit or accept any kickbacks in connection with government contracts. The 
Act provides both civil and criminal penalties for violations. Criminal violations can be 
punished by a fine, up to 10 years in prison, or both. Civil penalties up to twice the amount 
of the kickback also may be assessed. Additionally, the United States may offset the amount 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.276  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
of any kickback against the amount owed on the prime contract. 
 
Procurement Integrity Act (41 U.S.C. § 423)  
The Procurement Integrity Act prohibits certain activities by federal employees involved in 
the procurement process. Failure to comply with the Act can result in administrative actions, 
civil penalties, and criminal penalties (imprisonment of not more than five years and/or a 
fine).  
 
Specifically, the Act addresses offers of employment, post-employment restrictions, and 
disclosing/obtaining bid, proposal, or source selection information. Concerning offers of 
employment, employees who are involved in procurements over $100,000 and have had 
contact with a contractor regarding future nonfederal employment must report the contact 
and either reject the employment or exclude themselves from further participation in the 
procurement process. In addition, the Act prohibits certain employees who are involved in a 
procurement action or contract, either of which is valued at $10 million or greater, from 
accepting any compensation from a contractor as an employee or consultant of the 
contractor within a period of one year following their involvement. 
 
The Procurement Integrity Act also prohibits the release of source selection information 
(i.e., information that is prepared for use by a federal agency for the purpose of evaluating a 
bid or proposal) and contractor bid or proposal information (i.e., cost or pricing data; 
proprietary information identified as such by a contractor). 
 
The Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 (15 U.S.C. §§ 12–27, 52–53)  
Enacted as an amendment to the Sherman Antitrust Act, which was designed to combat 
anticompetitive practices, the Clayton Antitrust Act prohibits certain antitrust activities, 
including a prohibition on anticompetitive price discrimination and a prohibition against 
certain exclusive dealing practices. 
 
The Clayton Antitrust Act permits private parties injured by an antitrust violation to sue in 
federal court for three times their actual damages plus court costs and attorneys’ fees, and it 
authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil suits on behalf of injured consumers in their 
states. 
 
If successful, the plaintiff may recover damages of up to three times the actual loss incurred. 
The plaintiff need not prove the exact amount of damages sustained. A reasonable 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.277 
approximation, based on the best evidence available, is sufficient. The court can award 
interest for the period of the lawsuit if it finds that the defendant unreasonably delayed the 
proceedings. A foreign country plaintiff may be limited to actual damages. 
 
A criminal prosecution for antitrust violations can be brought in addition to a civil action for 
the same conduct. The court may regulate such “parallel proceedings” to prevent undue 
prejudice to the defendant, and may stay (delay) the civil case or discovery in the case until 
the criminal prosecution is completed. A previous criminal conviction of the defendant 
involving the same facts and parties may be admissible to prove liability in a civil action, 
leaving only the amount of the damages to prove. 
 
To recover damages under this Act, the plaintiff must be a person, which includes any 
individual, business, or state government capable of holding a property interest, and the 
plaintiff must establish that his business or property was injured by an antitrust violation 
(e.g., agreement to fix prices, collusive bidding, dividing markets, price discrimination, 
predatory pricing, group boycotts or concerted refusals to deal, or commercial bribery). 
 
Truth in Negotiations Act (10 U.S.C. § 2306) 
In 1962, Congress enacted TINA to protect the government from unscrupulous contractors 
that inflate costs by falsifying their cost proposals with inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent 
cost and pricing data.  
 
Under TINA, if a government contractor submits defective information that results in the 
price being artificially inflated and the government relies on it, the government is entitled to 
a reduction in the contract price to eliminate the effect of its reliance on the defective data. 
 
In instances where a contractor unknowingly submits defective data (i.e., defective data 
submitted for non-fraudulent reasons, such as negligence, accident, incompetence, or 
mistake), the government is entitled to a dollar-for-dollar price reduction in the contract 
price to eliminate the effect of its reliance on the defective data. If, however, defective data is 
knowingly submitted, TINA provides for not only a dollar-for-dollar price reduction, but 
“an additional amount equal to the overpayment.” 
 
Federal Acquisition Regulation 
The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is the system of regulations that govern the 
government’s procurement of goods and services. It does not regulate the purchasing 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.278  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
activities of private sector firms. The FAR is found in Chapter 1 of Title 48 of the Code of  
Federal Regulations (CFR), and the official electronic version is available at 
www.arnet.gov/far. 
 
Among other things, FAR regulates disclosure requirements for government contractors and 
provides administrative remedies against persons or entities that commit government 
contract fraud.  
 
MANDATORY DISCLOSURE RULE (FAR 3.1003(A)(2)) 
On December 12, 2008, a major revision to the FAR went into effect. Among other things, 
the revised FAR provisions require all government contractors to disclose “credible 
evidence” of criminal fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations found in Title 
18, as well as violations of the civil False Claims Act. Furthermore, the mandatory disclosure 
rules require that the contractor make reports to two different offices: the inspector general 
and the affected contracting officer. In addition, the mandatory disclosure rules make the 
failure to disclose violations a basis for suspension and debarment.  
 
ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES 
To help ensure that the government is dealing only with responsible contractors, the 
government uses suspension and debarment of contractors for certain offenses. The current 
regulations governing the debarment and suspension of federal government contractors are 
set forth in subpart 9.4 of the FAR.  
 
Suspension and debarment are administrative sanctions that disqualify contractors from 
government contracting and subcontracting. Suspension refers to an action taken by a 
suspending official to temporarily disqualify a contractor from government contracting. The 
government may suspend a contractor upon “adequate evidence” that the party has 
committed certain civil or criminal offenses. 
 
Debarment is defined as the action taken by a debarr ing official to exclude a contractor from 
government contracting for a specified period. Debarment actions require that this sanction 
be established by a “preponderance of the evidence” that the person engaged in conduct 
warranting debarment.
