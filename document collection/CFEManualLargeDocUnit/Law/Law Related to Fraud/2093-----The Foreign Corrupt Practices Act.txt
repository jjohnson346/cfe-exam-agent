The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1, 78dd-2, 78dd-3, 78m) 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) was originally enacted in 1977 to prohibit certain 
publicly held companies from making corrupt payments to foreign officials or political 
organizations. Other amendments to the Act make it illegal for any U.S. citizen to make such 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.250  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
payments. The statute was the result of disclosures from the Watergate investigations of 
corporate grease payments to foreigners to obtain business overseas.  
 
The FCPA criminalizes the bribery of a foreign public official in order to obtain or retain 
business, and it requires publicly traded companies to keep accurate books and records and 
adopt internal controls to prevent diversion of assets or other improper use of corporate 
funds. 
 
FCPA enforcement actions can include criminal actions by the Department of Justice (DOJ), 
civil actions brought by either the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the DOJ, 
or both, and administrative actions filed by the SEC.  
 
Since the FCPA was enacted, there have been a number of international initiatives to 
strengthen anti-bribery laws around the world. One of the most significant is the work of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD has 30 
member countries, including many of the world’s largest economic powers—the United 
States, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Australia, and the United 
Kingdom. In response to the articles drafted by the OECD, the member countries have or 
are in the process of drafting new, tougher transnational bribery laws. 
 
ANTI-BRIBERY PROVISIONS (15 U.S.C. § 78dd) 
The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA make it unlawful to bribe a foreign official for 
business purposes.  
 
FIVE ELEMENTS  
There are five elements to a violation: (1) regulated party, (2) payment or offer, (3) foreign 
official, (4) corrupt intent, and (5) business purpose.  
 
First, under the FCPA, U.S. jurisdiction over corrupt payments to foreign officials depends 
upon whether the violator is a regulated party. Regulated persons include all of the following: 
• A domestic concern : Any citizen, national, or resident of the United States, or any business 
entity that has its principal place of business in the United States or that is organized 
under the laws of a state, territory, possession, or commonwealth of the United States 
• Issuer : A corporation that has issued securities that have been registered in the United 
States or who is required to file periodic reports with the SEC 
• The agents or other representatives of domestic concerns and issuers 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.251 
• A foreign national or business that takes any act in furtherance of a corrupt payment 
within U.S. territory 
 
Second, the FCPA prohibits paying, offering, promising to pay, or authorizing to pay or 
offer money or anything of value. Under the FCPA, payments can include payments of 
money, gifts, charitable contributions or donation of benefit to foreign official, in-kind 
service, scholarship to foreign official’s relative, overpayments for shares, and loans at 
favorable interest rates. 
 
Third, the prohibition extends only to corrupt payments to a foreign official. The term 
foreign official is very broad and includes: 
• Any foreign department, instrumentality, or agency 
• Any entity owned or controlled by a foreign government 
• Any official or candidate of a foreign political party 
• Any public international organization  
• Any person acting in an official capacity on behalf of any of the above entities 
 
Fourth, the person making or authorizing the payment must have a corrupt intent. That is, 
the payment must be intended to influence the recipient to misuse his position.  
 
Finally, the payment must be related to a specific business purpose. Put differently, the 
payments must be related to obtaining business, retaining business, or directing business. 
The prohibition also covers payments to gain favorable tax or customs treatment or to 
obtain permits or licenses. 
 
CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT OF ANTI-BRIBERY PROVISIONS  
The Department of Justice (DOJ) is responsible  for all criminal enforcement of the FCPA. 
Under the anti-bribery provisions, corporations and other business entities are subject to a 
fine of up to $2,000,000, while  officers, directors, stockholders, employees, and agents are 
subject to a fine of up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to five years. Fines imposed on 
individuals may not be paid by their employer or principal. 
 
CIVIL ENFORCEMENT OF ANTI-BRIBERY PROVISIONS  
Civil enforcement of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA is shared by the Securities 
Exchange Commission (SEC) and the DOJ. The primary civil enforcement tool is an 
injunction, though the FCPA also provides for monetary penalties. The maximum civil 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.252  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
penalty for a violation by any firm, as well as by any officer, director, employee, or agent, is 
$10,000 per occurrence. In addition, in an SEC enforcement action, the court may impose 
an additional fine not to exceed the greater of (1) the gross amount of the pecuniary gain to 
the defendant as a result of the violation, or (2) a specified dollar limitation based on the 
flagrancy of the violation. 
 
ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS (15 U.S.C. § 78m) 
In addition to outlawing bribery payments, the FCPA also contains separate accounting 
provisions for certain entities already subject to the FCPA provisions. Congress enacted the 
FCPA’s accounting provisions as an additional deterrent to bribery based on its conclusion 
that U.S. companies concealed most bribes in their corporate books.  
 
Under the accounting provisions, issuers (i.e., companies with securities listed in the U.S. 
trading markets) must (1) maintain accurate books and records, and (2) adopt internal 
controls to prevent the improper use of corporate funds. 
 
In addition, the FCPA requires that a covered entity make a good-faith effort to ensure that 
any company, including joint ventures, in which the U.S. company or one of its subsidiaries 
holds 50 percent or less of the voting power comply with the FCPA accounting provisions. 
 
BOOKS AND RECORDS (RECORD-KEEPING) PROVISION  
The first major requirement of the accounting provisions is that all issuers must accurately 
record all transactions, keep receipts and other support for transactions, and keep records in 
a manner consistent with overall document retention and record-keeping policies. 
 
In practice, the books and records provisions are used to prevent three types of 
improprieties:  
• The failure to record improper transactions 
• The falsification of records to conceal improper transactions 
• The creation of records that are quantitatively correct, but fail to specify the qualitative 
aspects of a transaction that might reveal the true purpose of a particular payment 
 
  
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.253 
INTERNAL CONTROLS PROVISION  
The internal controls provision is designed to prevent unauthorized or unrecorded 
transactions. Under the internal controls provision, a company must maintain robust 
compliance policies and must take reasonable steps to ensure that its affiliates maintain 
suitable internal controls. 
 
The SEC has considered several factors to determine the adequacy of a system of internal 
controls. The factors include:  
• The role of the board of directors 
• Communication of corporate procedures and policies 
• Assignment of authority and responsibility 
• Competence and integrity of personnel 
• Accountability for performance and compliance with policies and procedures 
• Objectivity and effectiveness of the internal audit function 
 
SEC REGULATIONS REGARDING THE ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS  
The SEC has adopted two regulations enforcing the accounting provisions. First, Rule 13b2-
 1 makes it unlawful to falsify accounts, providing that “[n]o person shall, directly or 
indirectly, falsify or cause to be falsified, any book, record or account” required to be kept 
under the accounting provisions of the FCPA. Second, the SEC established Rule 13b2-2, 
which makes it unlawful to supply false information to auditors. This rule states that:  
 
ENFORCEMENT OF THE ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS  
The FCPA’s accounting provisions are enforced by both the SEC and the DOJ. The SEC 
has authority to initiate civil enforcement actions and can impose civil fines and 
disgorgement on the company and individuals. The SEC has brought enforcement actions of 
the accounting provisions both in cases involving actual foreign bribes and in domestic 
transactions. The SEC can seek civil penalties of up to $500,000 for covered entities and 
$100,000 for individuals. 
 
The DOJ is responsible for criminal prosecution of “willful” violations  of the accounting 
provisions, and criminal penalties can include large fines and imprisonment. A willful 
violation of the accounting and controls provision is punishable by a fine up to $25 million 
against entities, and a fine up to $5 million and imprisonment up to 20 years against 
individuals. 
 
Natural persons convicted of willful violations of the accounting provisions may be fined up  
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.254  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
to $5 million, imprisoned up to 20 years, or both. Corporations convicted of willful 
violations may be fined up to $25 million. Also, the FCPA provides that an individual may 
be held criminally liable for “knowingly” falsifying any book, records, or account, or 
circumventing or failing to implement a system of internal accounting controls. Knowing 
may include willful blindness or conscious attempts not to know. But no criminal liability is 
imposed for technical or insignificant accounting errors.  
 
In addition, administrative and civil relief also is available. A corporation or individual found 
in violation of the FCPA may be subject to debarment before many government agencies, 
and an indictment under the FCPA can also lead to the suspension of one’s right to do 
business with the government or the immediate suspension of export licenses for military 
defense equipment.
