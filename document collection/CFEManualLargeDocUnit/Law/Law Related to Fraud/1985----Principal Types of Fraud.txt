Principal Types of Fraud 
 
Misrepresentation of Material Facts 
Misrepresentation of material facts is most often thought of when the term fraud is used. 
Misrepresentation cases can be prosecuted criminally or civilly under a variety of statutes, 
such as false statements, false claims, or mail and wire fraud. They might also be the basis for 
common law claims. The gist of the offense is the deliberate making of false statements to 
induce the intended victim to part with money or property.  
 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.202  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
The specific elements composing proof of misrepresentation vary somewhat according to 
the jurisdiction and whether the case is prosecuted as a criminal or civil action. The elements 
normally include: 
• A material false statement  
• Knowledge of its falsity 
• Reliance on the false statement by the victim 
• Damages suffered 
 
Although it might be necessary to prove that the victim relied upon the false statements and 
actually suffered a loss in a civil case, these elements of proof might not be necessary in a 
criminal prosecution. In addition, in some statutes, materiality is assumed and need not be 
proved. 
 
In most instances, only false representations of “presently existing facts” may be prosecuted. 
Opinions or speculative statements about future events may not be the basis for a fraud case, 
even if made with the intent to mislead. A used car salesperson, for example, who assures 
the naive customer that the 20-year-old car towed to the lot will give him “years of driving 
pleasure” probably cannot be prosecuted for fraud. The salesperson could be prosecuted, 
however, if he tells the customer that the car has been driven only 15,000 miles when he 
knows that it has gone 150,000 miles. 
 
The rule limiting fraud cases to misrepresentations of existing facts is often applied to bar 
fraud claims in contract disputes. A party to a contract who promises to perform certain 
services by a particular date but fails to do so generally may not be prosecuted for fraud 
unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the defendant had the intent not to perform the 
promised services when the contract was made. Of course, the other party may file an action 
for breach of contract. 
 
The rule precluding fraud actions based on false “opinions” is subject to certain exceptions, 
principally cases involving opinions provided by professional advisers such as Certified 
Public Accountants. For example, an independent auditor may be liable for 
misrepresentation if he: 
• Certifies that a financial statement fairly presents the financial condition of the company 
when the auditor knows it does not, 
• Falsely states that the audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards, or 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.203 
• Deliberately distorts the audit results. 
 
Normally, only material false statements may serve as the basis for a fraud case. Materiality  
usually refers to statements sufficiently important or relevant to the defendant to influence 
the defendant’s decision. For example, a claim that a company enjoyed a 50 percent growth 
in profits would probably be material to a prospective investor, whereas a statement that the 
company was considering moving its headquarters from New York City to Chicago might 
not be. The materiality of allegedly false statements often is a central issue in security fraud 
cases.  
 
In all fraud cases, the prosecution or plaintiff must prove that a false statement was 
intentional and part of a deliberate scheme to defraud. A person intentionally makes a false 
statement if it is his desire to cause the social harm, or if he acts with knowledge that the 
social harm will almost certainly result from his actions. In some instances, particularly those 
involving civil actions for fraud and securities cases, the intent requirement is met if the 
prosecution or plaintiff is able to show that the false statements were made recklessly; that is, 
with complete disregard for truth or falsity. 
 
Moreover, there is no such thing as an accidental or negligent fraud. For exampale, 
mistakenly entering incorrect numbers on a financial statement is not fraud; however, 
knowingly entering incorrect numbers with the intent that someone will take action in 
reliance on them is fraud if the other elements are present. 
 
Although a misrepresentation fraud case may not be based on negligent or accidental 
misrepresentations, in some instances a civil action may be filed for negligent 
misrepresentation. This action is appropriate if a defendant suffered a loss because of the 
carelessness or negligence of another party upon which the defendant was entitled to rely. 
Examples would be negligent false statements to a prospective purchaser regarding the value 
of a closely held company’s stock or the accuracy of its financial statements. 
 
Concealment of Material Facts 
An action for fraud may be based on the concealment of material facts, but only if the 
defendant had a duty in the circumstances to disclose. The essential elements of fraud based 
on failure to disclose material facts are: 
• That the defendant had knowledge 
• Of a material fact 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.204  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• That the defendant had a duty to disclose 
• And failed to do so 
• With the intent to mislead or deceive the other party 
 
The duty to disclose usually depends on the relationship between the parties. Those people 
who occupy a special relationship of trust, such as the officers or directors of a corporation, 
an attorney, accountant, trustee, stockbroker, or other agent, may be found to have a duty to 
completely disclose material facts to the parties who rely upon them. Statutes might expand 
the duty to disclose to areas in which traditionally there was no such duty, such as to the 
sellers of personal or real property or to the purchasers or sellers of securities. 
 
Proof that the concealed fact was material probably is the most important element in a 
concealment case; there can be no liability if  the withheld information would not have 
affected the other party. In addition to fraudulent concealment, a defendant might also be 
liable for negligent failure to discover and disclose material facts. An accountant, for 
example, might be liable for failure to discover or report material facts in a financial 
statement or audit. Of course, as with neg ligent misrepresentation, the penalties are less 
severe for negligence than fraudulent misrepresentation, and there is no criminal liability. 
 
Bribery 
Bribery is a form of corruption that may be defined as the offering, giving, receiving, or 
soliciting of anything of value to influence an act or a decision.  
 
Types of Bribery Schemes 
Bribery includes official bribery and commercial bribery.  
 
OFFICIAL BRIBERY 
Official bribery  refers to the corruption of a public official. Illegal payments to public officials 
can give rise to stiff criminal penalties. The elements of official bribery vary by jurisdiction 
but generally are: 
• Giving or receiving 
• A thing of value 
• With the intent to corruptly influence 
• An official act 
 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.205 
COMMERCIAL BRIBERY 
In contrast, commercial bribery refers to the corruption of a private individual to gain a 
commercial or business advantage. Commercial bribery may be prosecuted either as a criminal 
act or by a civil action. About half of the states in the U.S. have criminal statutes that 
prohibit commercial bribery. If a state does not have a commercial bribery statute, 
commercial bribery schemes can usually be prosecuted under criminal fraud statutes on the 
theory that the payment of a commercial bribe defrauds the business owner of the right to 
an employee’s unbiased and loyal services. 
 
There is no federal statute prohibiting commercial bribery, but such offenses may be 
prosecuted at the federal level as mail or wire fraud, as a RICO violation, or as a violation of 
some other law. The elements of commercial bribery vary by jurisdiction, but typically 
include: 
• Giving or receiving 
• A thing of value 
• With intent to corruptly influence 
• A business decision 
• Without the knowledge or consent of the principal 
 
The “without the knowledge or consent of the principal” element is included on the theory 
that a private business owner is not defrauded if the owner knows of or allows employees to 
accept gifts, favors, or other payments from vendors or other business contacts. 
 
Most state commercial bribery statutes are misdemeanors punishable by a jail term of no 
more than one year. Commercial bribery is a felony in Colorado, Kansas, Texas, Arizona (if 
the value of the bribe payment is $100 or more) and New Hampshire (if the value of the 
bribe is $500 or more). The New York commercial bribery law is a typical statute that makes 
it a misdemeanor to give or receive (or to offer or solicit) “any benefit” without the consent 
of the employer, with the intent of influencing the employee’s business conduct. The 
Louisiana, Michigan, and New Jersey commercial bribery statutes confer immunity on the 
party to the scheme who first agrees to testify against the other party in a criminal 
proceeding. 
 
Businesses injured by commercial bribery schemes may sue for treble damages and attorneys’ 
fees under the Civil RICO statute (Title 18 U.S. Code Section 1964) and the Clayton 
Antitrust Act (Title 15 U.S. Code Section 13(c)), and for compensatory and punitive 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.206  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
damages for common law fraud, conflict of interest, and breach of fiduciary duty. Civil 
actions may be brought even if commercial bribery is not a crime in a jurisdiction. 
 
Methods of Making Corrupt Payments 
In bribery schemes, the thing of value  is not limited to cash or money. Any tangible benefit 
given or received with the intent to corruptly influence the recipient may be an illegal 
payment. Courts have held that such things as lavish gifts and entertainment, payment of 
travel and lodging expenses, payment of credit card bills, loans, promises of future 
employment, and interests in businesses, can be bribes if they were given or received with 
the intent to influence or be influenced. Some state statutes might distinguish between 
felonies or misdemeanors according to the amount of illegal payment. 
 
Corrupt Influence 
To establish a bribery claim, it must be proven that the defendant acted with Proof of corrupt 
influence often involves demonstration that the person receiving the bribe favored the bribe-
 payer in some improper or unusual way, such as by providing preferential treatment, bending 
or breaking the rules, taking extraordinary steps to assist the bribe-payer, or allowing the 
bribe-payer to defraud the agency or company. It is not necessary, however, that the 
prosecution or plaintiff demonstrate that the bribe-taker acted improperly; a bribe might be 
paid to induce an official to perform an act that otherwise would be legal, or an act that the 
official might have performed without a bribe. Bribery schemes involving these 
circumstances, however, are difficult to prove and lack appeal for prosecution. 
 
Illegal Gratuity 
Illegal gratuities are similar to bribery schemes. In fact, under the federal legislation governing 
the offenses of bribery and illegal gratuity (Title 18 U.S. Code Section 201), an illegal gratuity 
is a lesser-included offense of official bribery. The elements of an illegal gratuity are:  
• Giving or receiving 
• A thing of value 
• For or because of 
• An official act 
 
The big difference between a bribe and an illegal gratuity is that an illegal gratuity charge 
does not require proof that the gratuity was given for the purpose of influencing an official 
act. In other words, an illegal gratuity charge only requires that the gratuity be given for or 
because of an official act.  
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.207 
In the typical illegal gratuities scenario, a decision is made which happens to benefit a certain 
person or company. The party who benefited from the decision then gives a gift to the 
person who made the decision. The gifts are merely offered as a “thank you” for something 
that has been done. 
 
The federal statute governing the illegal gratuity offense prohibits a public official from 
accepting any payment of money or thing of value other than his lawful compensation. In 
practice, the statute often is applied when relatively small payments, such as gifts or 
entertainment, are used to attempt to influence a public official. 
 
Extortion 
An extortion case is often the flip side of a bribery case. Extortion is defined as the obtaining 
of property from another with the other party’s “consent” having been induced by wrongful 
use of actual or threatened force or fear. Fear might include the apprehension of possible 
economic damage or loss. A demand for a bribe or kickback, coupled with a threat of 
adverse action if the payment is not paid, also might constitute extortion. 
 
In most states and the federal system, extortion is not a defense to bribery. That is, a person 
who makes a bribe payment upon demand of the recipient still is culpable for bribery. In 
New York, however, extortion may be a defense in certain circumstances. 
 
Conflict of Interest 
A conflict of interest occurs when an employee has an undisclosed personal or economic 
interest in a transaction. These schemes involve self-dealing by an employee and can occur in 
various ways. A conflict may occur when an employee accepts inappropriate gifts, favors, or 
kickbacks from vendors, or when an employee engages in unapproved employment 
discussions with current or prospective contractors or suppliers. 
 
Statutes in every state and the federal system (as well as common law decisions in all 
jurisdictions) prohibit people from engaging in conduct that involves a conflict of interest. A 
conflict of interest may be prosecuted civilly or criminally. The criminal statutes vary widely 
and include prohibitions on public officers from accepting employment with government 
contractors or lobbying government agencies during specified times. 
 
Elements of a typical civil claim for conflict of interest include: 
• An agent taking an interest in a transaction 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.208  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• That is actually or potentially adverse to the principal 
• Without full and timely disclosure to and approval by the principal 
 
An agent includes any person who, under the law, owes a duty of loyalty to another, including 
officers, directors, and employees of a corporation, public officials, trustees, brokers, 
independent contractors, attorneys, and accountants. People who do not occupy positions of 
trust with another party, such as arms-length commercial parties, do not owe a duty of 
loyalty to each other and therefore are not subject to conflict of interest restrictions. 
 
The defendant in a civil conflict of interest case must repay any losses that the conflict 
caused and “disgorge” any profits he earned because of the conflict, even if there was no 
actual loss to the principal. The “disloyal” party also might be required to forfeit all 
compensation received during the period of disloyalty. The victim of a conflict of interest 
also may void any contracts entered into on its behalf that were the result of or influenced by 
the conflict. 
 
Forgery 
Forgery includes two distinct common law offenses: forgery and uttering a forged 
instrument. Both crimes are specific intent offenses, i.e., they both require proof of specific 
intent to defraud. 
 
Forgery is: 
• The fraudulent making or altering 
• Of a false writing or instrument that has apparent legal significance 
• With the intent to defraud 
 
Uttering a forged instrument expands the forgery offense by including the offering or 
passing of a forged document as genuine. The elements of uttering a forged instrument are: 
• Offering as genuine 
• A forged instrument 
• With the intent to defraud 
 
A forgery occurs when a document is not what it purports to be. It is not forgery just 
because the writing contains a false representation. The writing as a whole must have 
apparent legal significance. Forgery occurs not just when an entire writing or instrument is 
created, but also when there is any material alteration that affects the legal significance of the 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.209 
document and/or whenever a signature on a writing is fraudulently procured from a person 
who does not know what he is signing. Furthermore, the offense is committed even if no 
one is actually defrauded. 
 
Although forgery is a crime, not a civil wrong, it can occur in connection with a fraud or a 
conversion of property or property interests, for which the victim can seek civil remedies. 
 
Theft of Money and Property 
Theft is a term often used to describe a wide variety of fraudulent conduct. Many state 
statutes describe misrepresentation fraud as theft by deception or larceny by trick. As used here, 
the term theft is limited to embezzlement, larceny, and misappropriation of trade secrets and 
proprietary information. 
 
Embezzlement 
Embezzlement is the wrongful appropriation of money or property by a person to whom it has 
been lawfully entrusted (or to whom lawful possession was given). Embezzlement involves a 
breach of trust, although it is not necessary to show a fiduciary relationship between the 
parties. The elements of embezzlement are generally: 
• The defendant took or converted 
• Without the knowledge or consent of the owner 
• Money or property of another 
• That was entrusted to the defendant (defendant had lawful possession of the property) 
 
Larceny 
Larceny is defined as the unlawful taking of money or property of another with the intent to 
convert or to deprive the owner. Unlike in embezzlement, in larceny the defendant never has 
lawful possession of the property, but may have mere custody of it (e.g., a cashier has 
custody, not possession, of money in a register). The elements of larceny typically include: 
• Unlawfully taking or carrying away 
• Money or property of another 
• Without the consent of the owner 
• With the intent to permanently deprive the owner of its use or possession 
 
Misappropriation of Trade Secrets 
Misappropriation is the intentional, illegal use of the property, funds, or ideas of another 
person for an unauthorized purpose. In the fraud context, misappropriation claims generally 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.210  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
involve trade secrets or other proprietary information. 
 
Trade secret includes not only secret formulas and processes, but also more mundane 
proprietary information, such as customer and price lists, sales figures, business plans, or any 
other confidential information that has a value to the business and would be potentially 
harmful if disclosed. 
 
Theft or misappropriation of trade secrets may be prosecuted under a variety of federal and 
state statutes and the common law. The definition of what constitutes a trade secret depends 
on the organization, industry, and jurisdiction, but the following three characteristics are 
common to most definitions: 
• The information is not generally known to the relevant portion of the public. 
• It confers some sort of economic benefit on its holder (where this benefit must derive 
specifically from its not being generally known, not just from the value of the 
information itself). 
• It is the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. 
 
The elements of a typical theft of trade secret claim are: 
• That a party possessed information of value to the business 
• The information was treated confidentially 
• That the defendant took or used the information by breach of an agreement, confidential 
relationship, or other improper means 
 
An organization can only maintain legal protection over its trade secrets if it takes reasonable 
steps to keep that information secret. Thus, it is critical that the information being sought to 
be protected was treated confidentially, although absolute secrecy is not required; it is 
sufficient if the information was “substantially” undisclosed. Limited disclosure to people 
with a need to know or pursuant to confidentiality agreements will not void the secret. 
Methods of demonstrating that information was intended to be kept confidential include a 
written policy describing the information as proprietary or secret; strict limitations on 
distribution of the information; and physically securing the information to prevent 
unauthorized access and use. 
 
The owners of the information also should enforce restrictive agreements and act promptly 
to remedy any inadvertent disclosures. Failure to do so might be construed as a waiver of 
confidentiality and make it impossible to prevent future use or disclosures. 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.211 
COMMON DEFENSE IN TRADE SECRET CASES 
The most typical defense is that the information was developed independently. If the 
aggrieved party demonstrates that the information came to the defendant as the result of or 
during a confidential relationship, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to 
demonstrate independent discovery. The defendant also might defend a misappropriation 
claim by showing that the information was not in fact a secret, that the third party’s use was 
authorized, or that the trade secret or proprietary information had been abandoned by the 
owner. 
 
CIVIL ACTION FOR TRADE SECRET THEFT 
A victim of theft of trade secrets may file a civil action for damages or request an injunction 
under a variety of federal and state statutes. Civil damages include reimbursement for actual 
losses caused by the defendant, such as lost profits, reimbursement of development expenses 
and overhead costs, and the cost of efforts to protect the secret or recover damages, as well 
as for reduction in the value of business. Damages also can be measured by the defendant’s 
profits, which may be ordered to be paid to the plaintiff. Punitive damages and attorney’s 
fees also may be awarded. 
 
In addition to or in lieu of monetary damages, the plaintiff in a civil action for theft of trade 
secrets also may obtain an injunction prohibiting further use of the information. To obtain 
an injunction, the plaintiff must demonstrate that: 
• It is the proper owner of the trade secret 
• An unauthorized person has taken or used the trade secret 
• There is a high probability of improper disclosure 
• The plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury (meaning that the plaintiff could not be 
adequately compensated by monetary damages) 
• The plaintiff probably will win the case 
 
Injunctions have been issued in numerous trade secret cases to prevent the use of stolen 
information, to prohibit an employee in possession of a trade secret from accepting 
employment with a competitor, or to order the wrongdoer to return the misappropriated 
information. The injunction usually prohibits use of the trade secret only for that period it 
would have been required for its legitimate independent development. However, injunctions 
are difficult to obtain. 
 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.212  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Breach of Contract 
If the fraudster has any kind of a contractual relationship with the victim, there may also be a 
breach of contract claim. Any non-performance of a contractual obligation or an announcement 
that a party cannot or will not perform constitutes a breach. In other words, a breach of 
contract occurs when one party fails to perform, or announces that it does not intend to 
perform, without just cause.  
 
A breach of contract claim can arise under an oral or written contract. Many states have 
recognized certain implied or unwritten duties as a part of almost every contract. For 
instance, some courts have held that it is an implicit part of a contract that each party will 
use their best efforts to fulfill their duties under the contract. A similar duty that has been 
recognized by some states is the duty to deal with each other in good faith. If a party to a 
contract, which includes an employment contract, steals from the other party or acts in bad 
faith, there may be a civil claim for breach of contract. 
 
Gross Negligence 
Gross negligence can be generally defined as the intentional failure to perform a duty in reckless 
disregard of the consequences to the victim. Although the exact definition varies by state, 
the basic elements of this civil cause of action are that the defendant committed an 
intentional act, knowing that it was at least substantially likely to cause harm to the victim. In 
regards to an employee, the employee has a duty to act in the best interests of the employer. 
If the employee consciously steals from the employer, the employee has breached that duty 
and caused harm to the employer; further, the employee knew that the harm would occur 
when he committed the act. One further note about gross negligence — generally, punitive or 
exemplary damages are available if the defendant is found liable. 
 
Breach of Fiduciary Duty 
People in a position of trust or fiduciary relationship — such as officers, directors, high-level 
employees of a corporation or business, and agents and brokers — owe certain duties 
imposed by law to their principals or employers. The principal fiduciary duties are loyalty 
and care. 
 
Duty of Loyalty 
The duty of loyalty requires that the employee/agent act solely in the best interest of the 
employer/principal, free of any self-dealing, conflicts of interest, or other abuse of the 
principal for personal advantage. Thus, corporate directors, officers, and employees are 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.213 
barred from using corporate property or assets for their personal pursuits or taking 
corporate opportunities for themselves. More traditional forms of fraudulent conduct, such 
as embezzlements, thefts, acceptance of kickbacks, and conflicts of interest, also violate the 
duty of loyalty and may be prosecuted as such in addition to or instead of the underlying 
offense. 
 
A breach of duty of loyalty is easier to prove than fraud. The plaintiff does not need to 
prove criminal or fraudulent intent or the other elements of fraud. To prevail, the plaintiff 
must show only that the defendant occupied a position of trust or fiduciary relationship as 
described above, and that the defendant breached that duty to benefit personally. 
 
Duty of Care 
A corporate officer, director, or high-level employee, as well as other people in a fiduciary 
relationship, must conduct business affairs prudently with the skill and attention normally 
exercised by people in similar positions. Fiduciaries who act carelessly or recklessly are 
responsible for any resulting loss to the corporate shareholders or other principals. Damages 
may be recovered in a civil action for negligence, mismanagement, or waste of corporate 
assets. 
 
People in a fiduciary relationship, however, are not guarantors against all business reverses or 
errors in judgment. The business judgment rule protects corporate officers and directors from 
liability for judgments that were made in good faith (e.g., free of self-dealings or conflicts) 
and that appeared to be prudent based on the then-known circumstances. 
 
Corporate officers breach their duty of loyalty if they accept kickbacks, engage in a conflict 
of interest, or are otherwise disloyal. However, corporate officers who carelessly fail to 
prevent such conduct, enforce controls, or pursue recovery of losses might breach their duty 
of care. Corporate defendants in such cases might raise the business judgment rule in 
defense by showing that they had no reasonable grounds to suspect such conduct or that the 
cost of prevention or recovery was too high compared to the anticipated returns. 
 
Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claim 
A breach of fiduciary duty claim is a civil action. The plaintiff may receive damages for lost 
profits and recover profits that the disloyal employee earned—in some instances even the 
salary paid to the employee or agent during the period of disloyalty. The plaintiff may 
recover profits earned by the disloyal agent even if the principal did not suffer an actual loss. 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.214  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
The plaintiff also may void any contracts entered into on its behalf that were the result of or 
were influenced by the employee or agent’s disloyalty.
