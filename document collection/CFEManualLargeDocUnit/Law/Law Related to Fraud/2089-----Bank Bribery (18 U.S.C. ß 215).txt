Bank Bribery (18 U.S.C. § 215) 
Title 18, U.S. Code, section 215 bars the corrupt giving or receiving of anything of value to 
influence the action of an employee or agent of a federally connected financial institution. 
The statute is aimed primarily at reducing corrupt influence in loan making. Unlike sections 
212 and 213 above, a specific intent to influence or be influenced through illegal payment 
must be proven to obtain a conviction. A payment made after a loan has been approved and 
disbursed may be in violation of the law if it is part of a prearranged plan or agreement.
