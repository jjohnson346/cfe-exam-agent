THE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR ECONOMIC AND CLINICAL HEALTH ACT  
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), which was enacted on 
February 17, 2009, contains many compliance challenges for entities that create, maintain, 
disclose, or use health information. Title XIII of ARRA, the Health Information Technology 
for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), imposed additional requirements for 
notifications of federal security breaches and added numerous privacy and data security 
restrictions for covered entities under HIPAA. The act also increased the maximum fine 
under HIPAA from $100,000 to $1,500,000.
