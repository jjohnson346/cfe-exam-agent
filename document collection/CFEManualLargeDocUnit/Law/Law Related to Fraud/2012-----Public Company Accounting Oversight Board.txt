Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 101 establishes the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.215 
(PCAOB), whose purpose is: 
 
[T]o oversee the audit of public companies that are subject to the securities laws, and related matters, in 
order to protect the interests of investors and further the public interest in the preparation of informative, 
accurate, and independent audit reports for companies the securities of which are sold to, and held by and 
for, public investors. 
 
In short, the PCAOB is charged with overseeing public company audits, setting audit 
standards, and investigating acts of noncompliance by auditors or audit firms. The PCAOB 
is to be appointed and overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which 
is part of the Executive branch. It is to be made up of five persons, two who are or have 
been CPAs and three who have never been CPAs. The PCAOB members, which are 
appointed by the SEC, can only be removed by the SEC for cause. 
 
The Act lists the PCAOB’s duties, which include: 
• Registering public accounting firms that audit publicly traded companies 
• Establishing or adopting auditing, quality control, ethics, independence, and other 
standards relating to audits of publicly traded companies 
• Inspecting registered public accounting firms 
• Investigating registered public accounting firms and their employees, conducting 
disciplinary hearings, and imposing sanctions where justified 
• Performing such other duties as are necessary to promote high professional standards 
among registered accounting firms, to improve the quality of audit services offered by 
those firms, and to protect investors 
• Enforcing compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the rules of the PCAOB, 
professional standards, and securities laws relating to public company audits 
 
Recently, the Supreme Court considered a constitutional challenge to the PCAOB in Free 
Enterprise Fund v. Public Comp any Accounting Oversight Board, et al. In this case, the Free 
Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit public interest organization, and a Nevada accounting firm 
sued the PCAOB seeking an order that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act violates the U.S. 
Constitution.  
 
The main issue raised by the suit concerned whether SOX violated the separation of powers 
doctrine by the manner in which the PCAOB’s members are selected and removed. To 
review, the separation of powers doctrine precludes each of the three branches of 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.216  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
government (legislative, executive, and judicial) from interfering upon the domain of the 
other two branches. In particular, the plaintiffs argued that SOX is unconstitutional because 
the PCAOB’s members are impermissibly insulated from presidential oversight, noting that 
the members are appointed by, and can only be removed for cause by, the SEC and not the 
president. 
 
In its opinion, the Supreme Court ruled that, because the President lacks the power to fire 
the Board members, the current method for removing PCAOB members violated the 
separation of powers principles. The Court detailed that the “buck stops” with the President, 
and, therefore, a clear and effective chain of command must be in place. “By granting the 
Board executive power without the Executive’s oversight [SOX] subverts the President’s 
ability to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed — as well as the public’s ability to pass 
judgment on his efforts. The Act’s restrictions are incompatible with the Constitution’s 
separation of powers…. Congress cannot limit the President’s authority in this way.”  
 
Despite ruling that the provision violated the Constitution, the Court allowed SOX to 
remain “fully operative as a law.” It also said that, to bring the PCAOB into compliance with 
the Constitution, the SEC must be given the ability to remove the Board members at will. 
Thus, PCAOB may continue to function without any for operational changes or legislative 
action. 
 
REGISTRATION WITH THE BOARD 
Public accounting firms must be registered with the PCAOB to legally prepare or issue an 
audit report on a publicly traded company. To become registered, accounting firms must 
disclose, among other things, the names of all public companies they audited in the 
preceding year, the names of all public companies they expect to audit in the current year, 
and the annual fees they received from each of their public audit clients for audit, 
accounting, and non-audit services.  
 
AUDITING, QUALITY CONTROL, AND INDEPENDENCE STANDARDS AND RULES 
Section 103 of the Act requires the PCAOB to establish standards for auditing, quality 
control, ethics, independence, and other issues relating to audits of publicly traded 
companies. Although the Act places the responsibility on the PCAOB to establish audit 
standards, it also sets forth certain rules that the PCAOB is required to include in those 
auditing standards. Among these rules are:  
• Audit work papers must be maintained for at least seven years. 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.217 
• Auditing firms must include a concurring or second partner review and approval of audit 
reports, as well as concurring approval in the issuance of the audit report by a qualified 
person other than the person in charge of the audit. 
• All audit reports must describe the scope of testing of the company’s internal control 
structure and present the auditor’s findings from the testing, including an evaluation of 
whether the internal control structure is acceptable and a description of material 
weaknesses in internal controls and any material noncompliance with controls. 
 
Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the PCAOB, in conjunction with the 
Security Exchange Commission (SEC), has promulgated several rules requiring compliance 
with additional auditing standards. Because these rules are extensive and ever-changing, 
auditors should periodically review the SEC’s website for updates and new rules at 
http://sec.gov/rules/final.shtml.  
 
INSPECTIONS OF REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMS 
The Act also authorizes the PCAOB to conduct regular inspections of public accounting 
firms to assess their degree of compliance with laws, rules, and professional standards 
regarding audits. Inspections are to be conducted once a year for firms that regularly audit 
more than 100 public companies and at least once every three years for firms that regularly 
audit 100 or fewer public companies.  
 
INVESTIGATIONS AND DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS 
The PCAOB has the authority to investigate registered public accounting firms (or their 
employees) for potential violations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, professional standards, any 
rules established by the board, or any securities laws relating to the preparation and issuance 
of audit reports. During an investigation, the PCAOB has the power to compel testimony 
and document production.  
 
Additionally, the PCAOB has the power to issue sanctions for violations or for 
noncooperation with an investigation. Sanctions can include temporary or permanent 
suspension of a firm’s registration with the board (which would mean that firm could no 
longer legally audit publicly traded companies), temporary or permanent suspension of a 
person’s right to be associated with a registered public accounting firm, prohibition from 
auditing public companies, and civil monetary penalties of up to $750,000 for an individual 
and up to $15,000,000 for a firm.
