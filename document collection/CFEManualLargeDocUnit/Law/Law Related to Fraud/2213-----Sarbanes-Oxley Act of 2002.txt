Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION BY THE ACCUSED (18 U.S.C. § 1512(C)) 
Sarbanes-Oxley amended section 1512 of the U.S. Code to make it a criminal offense to 
corruptly alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal a record or document with the intent to impair 
its integrity or use in an official proceeding, or to otherwise obstruct, influence, or impede 
any official proceeding or attempt to do so. Until Congress amended section 1512, it was 
more narrowly focused on witness tampering. Violations of this section are punishable by 
fines up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to 20 years. 
 
DESTRUCTION, ALTERATION, OR FALSIFICATION OF RECORDS IN FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS AND BANKRUPTCY (18 U.S.C. § 1519) 
Following the Enron scandal, section 1519 of Title 18, U.S. Code, was added to narrow the 
scope of when destruction under a document retention policy must cease. Unlike section 
1512(c), which uses the word corruptly, section 1519 uses the word knowingly.  
 
DESTRUCTION OF CORPORATE AUDIT RECORDS (18 U.S.C. § 1520) 
Section 802 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act added a statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1520, to govern the 
destruction of corporate audit records. Section 1520 makes it a crime for accountants to 
knowingly and willfully fail to maintain certain audit records and work papers for five years

from the end of the fiscal period in which the audit was concluded. In addition to providing 
for prosecution of those who obstruct justice, the statute is designed to ensure that 
important financial evidence is maintained so that government officials, regulators, and 
victims can determine whether a violation occurred.
