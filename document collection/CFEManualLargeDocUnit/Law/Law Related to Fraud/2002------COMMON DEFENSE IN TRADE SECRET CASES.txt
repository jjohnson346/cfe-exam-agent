COMMON DEFENSE IN TRADE SECRET CASES 
The most typical defense is that the information was developed independently. If the 
aggrieved party demonstrates that the information came to the defendant as the result of or 
during a confidential relationship, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to 
demonstrate independent discovery. The defendant also might defend a misappropriation 
claim by showing that the information was not in fact a secret, that the third party’s use was 
authorized, or that the trade secret or proprietary information had been abandoned by the 
owner.
