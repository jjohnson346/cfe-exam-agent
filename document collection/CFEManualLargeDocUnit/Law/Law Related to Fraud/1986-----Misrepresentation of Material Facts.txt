Misrepresentation of Material Facts 
Misrepresentation of material facts is most often thought of when the term fraud is used. 
Misrepresentation cases can be prosecuted criminally or civilly under a variety of statutes, 
such as false statements, false claims, or mail and wire fraud. They might also be the basis for 
common law claims. The gist of the offense is the deliberate making of false statements to 
induce the intended victim to part with money or property.  
 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.202  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
The specific elements composing proof of misrepresentation vary somewhat according to 
the jurisdiction and whether the case is prosecuted as a criminal or civil action. The elements 
normally include: 
• A material false statement  
• Knowledge of its falsity 
• Reliance on the false statement by the victim 
• Damages suffered 
 
Although it might be necessary to prove that the victim relied upon the false statements and 
actually suffered a loss in a civil case, these elements of proof might not be necessary in a 
criminal prosecution. In addition, in some statutes, materiality is assumed and need not be 
proved. 
 
In most instances, only false representations of “presently existing facts” may be prosecuted. 
Opinions or speculative statements about future events may not be the basis for a fraud case, 
even if made with the intent to mislead. A used car salesperson, for example, who assures 
the naive customer that the 20-year-old car towed to the lot will give him “years of driving 
pleasure” probably cannot be prosecuted for fraud. The salesperson could be prosecuted, 
however, if he tells the customer that the car has been driven only 15,000 miles when he 
knows that it has gone 150,000 miles. 
 
The rule limiting fraud cases to misrepresentations of existing facts is often applied to bar 
fraud claims in contract disputes. A party to a contract who promises to perform certain 
services by a particular date but fails to do so generally may not be prosecuted for fraud 
unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the defendant had the intent not to perform the 
promised services when the contract was made. Of course, the other party may file an action 
for breach of contract. 
 
The rule precluding fraud actions based on false “opinions” is subject to certain exceptions, 
principally cases involving opinions provided by professional advisers such as Certified 
Public Accountants. For example, an independent auditor may be liable for 
misrepresentation if he: 
• Certifies that a financial statement fairly presents the financial condition of the company 
when the auditor knows it does not, 
• Falsely states that the audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards, or 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.203 
• Deliberately distorts the audit results. 
 
Normally, only material false statements may serve as the basis for a fraud case. Materiality  
usually refers to statements sufficiently important or relevant to the defendant to influence 
the defendant’s decision. For example, a claim that a company enjoyed a 50 percent growth 
in profits would probably be material to a prospective investor, whereas a statement that the 
company was considering moving its headquarters from New York City to Chicago might 
not be. The materiality of allegedly false statements often is a central issue in security fraud 
cases.  
 
In all fraud cases, the prosecution or plaintiff must prove that a false statement was 
intentional and part of a deliberate scheme to defraud. A person intentionally makes a false 
statement if it is his desire to cause the social harm, or if he acts with knowledge that the 
social harm will almost certainly result from his actions. In some instances, particularly those 
involving civil actions for fraud and securities cases, the intent requirement is met if the 
prosecution or plaintiff is able to show that the false statements were made recklessly; that is, 
with complete disregard for truth or falsity. 
 
Moreover, there is no such thing as an accidental or negligent fraud. For exampale, 
mistakenly entering incorrect numbers on a financial statement is not fraud; however, 
knowingly entering incorrect numbers with the intent that someone will take action in 
reliance on them is fraud if the other elements are present. 
 
Although a misrepresentation fraud case may not be based on negligent or accidental 
misrepresentations, in some instances a civil action may be filed for negligent 
misrepresentation. This action is appropriate if a defendant suffered a loss because of the 
carelessness or negligence of another party upon which the defendant was entitled to rely. 
Examples would be negligent false statements to a prospective purchaser regarding the value 
of a closely held company’s stock or the accuracy of its financial statements.
