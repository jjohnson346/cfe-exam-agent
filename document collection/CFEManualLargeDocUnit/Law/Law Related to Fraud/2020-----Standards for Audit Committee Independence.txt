Standards for Audit Committee Independence 
AUDIT COMMITTEE RESPONSIBILITIES  
Section 301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act makes the audit committee for each publicly traded 
company “directly responsible” for appointing, compensating, and overseeing the work of 
the company’s outside auditors. The Act also mandates that the auditors must report directly 
to the audit committee — not management — and makes it the responsibility of the audit 
committee to resolve disputes between management and the auditors. Section 301 also 
requires that the audit committee must have the authority and funding to hire independent 
counsel and any other advisors it deems necessary to carry out its duties.  
 
COMPOSITION OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandates that each member of a company’s audit committee must 
be a member of its board of directors and must otherwise be “independent.” The term 
“independent” means that the audit committee members can only receive compensation 
from the company for their service on the board of directors, the audit committee, or 
another committee of the board of directors. They cannot be paid by the company for any 
other consulting or advisory work.  
 
FINANCIAL EXPERT  
Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires every public company to disclose in its 
periodic reports to the SEC whether or not the audit committee has at least one member

who is a “financial expert,” and if not, to explain the reasons why. The Act defines a 
“financial expert” as a person who, through education and experience as a public accountant, 
auditor, CFO, comptroller, chief accounting officer, or a similar position, (1) has an 
understanding of generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements; (2) has 
experience in preparing or auditing financial statements of comparable companies and the 
application of such principles in accounting for estimates, accruals, and reserves; (3) has 
experience with internal controls; and (4) has an understanding of audit committee 
functions.  
 
ESTABLISHING A WHISTLEBLOWING STRUCTURE 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act makes it the responsibility of the audit committee to establish 
procedures (e.g., a hotline) for receiving and dealing with complaints and anonymous 
employee tips regarding irregularities in the company’s accounting methods, internal 
controls, or auditing matters.
