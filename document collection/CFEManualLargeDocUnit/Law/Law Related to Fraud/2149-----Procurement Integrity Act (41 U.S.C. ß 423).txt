Procurement Integrity Act (41 U.S.C. § 423)  
The Procurement Integrity Act prohibits certain activities by federal employees involved in 
the procurement process. Failure to comply with the Act can result in administrative actions, 
civil penalties, and criminal penalties (imprisonment of not more than five years and/or a 
fine).  
 
Specifically, the Act addresses offers of employment, post-employment restrictions, and 
disclosing/obtaining bid, proposal, or source selection information. Concerning offers of 
employment, employees who are involved in procurements over $100,000 and have had 
contact with a contractor regarding future nonfederal employment must report the contact 
and either reject the employment or exclude themselves from further participation in the 
procurement process. In addition, the Act prohibits certain employees who are involved in a 
procurement action or contract, either of which is valued at $10 million or greater, from 
accepting any compensation from a contractor as an employee or consultant of the 
contractor within a period of one year following their involvement. 
 
The Procurement Integrity Act also prohibits the release of source selection information 
(i.e., information that is prepared for use by a federal agency for the purpose of evaluating a 
bid or proposal) and contractor bid or proposal information (i.e., cost or pricing data; 
proprietary information identified as such by a contractor).
