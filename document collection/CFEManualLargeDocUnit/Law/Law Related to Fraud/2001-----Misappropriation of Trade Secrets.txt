Misappropriation of Trade Secrets 
Misappropriation is the intentional, illegal use of the property, funds, or ideas of another 
person for an unauthorized purpose. In the fraud context, misappropriation claims generally 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.210  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
involve trade secrets or other proprietary information. 
 
Trade secret includes not only secret formulas and processes, but also more mundane 
proprietary information, such as customer and price lists, sales figures, business plans, or any 
other confidential information that has a value to the business and would be potentially 
harmful if disclosed. 
 
Theft or misappropriation of trade secrets may be prosecuted under a variety of federal and 
state statutes and the common law. The definition of what constitutes a trade secret depends 
on the organization, industry, and jurisdiction, but the following three characteristics are 
common to most definitions: 
• The information is not generally known to the relevant portion of the public. 
• It confers some sort of economic benefit on its holder (where this benefit must derive 
specifically from its not being generally known, not just from the value of the 
information itself). 
• It is the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. 
 
The elements of a typical theft of trade secret claim are: 
• That a party possessed information of value to the business 
• The information was treated confidentially 
• That the defendant took or used the information by breach of an agreement, confidential 
relationship, or other improper means 
 
An organization can only maintain legal protection over its trade secrets if it takes reasonable 
steps to keep that information secret. Thus, it is critical that the information being sought to 
be protected was treated confidentially, although absolute secrecy is not required; it is 
sufficient if the information was “substantially” undisclosed. Limited disclosure to people 
with a need to know or pursuant to confidentiality agreements will not void the secret. 
Methods of demonstrating that information was intended to be kept confidential include a 
written policy describing the information as proprietary or secret; strict limitations on 
distribution of the information; and physically securing the information to prevent 
unauthorized access and use. 
 
The owners of the information also should enforce restrictive agreements and act promptly 
to remedy any inadvertent disclosures. Failure to do so might be construed as a waiver of 
confidentiality and make it impossible to prevent future use or disclosures.

COMMON DEFENSE IN TRADE SECRET CASES 
The most typical defense is that the information was developed independently. If the 
aggrieved party demonstrates that the information came to the defendant as the result of or 
during a confidential relationship, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to 
demonstrate independent discovery. The defendant also might defend a misappropriation 
claim by showing that the information was not in fact a secret, that the third party’s use was 
authorized, or that the trade secret or proprietary information had been abandoned by the 
owner. 
 
CIVIL ACTION FOR TRADE SECRET THEFT 
A victim of theft of trade secrets may file a civil action for damages or request an injunction 
under a variety of federal and state statutes. Civil damages include reimbursement for actual 
losses caused by the defendant, such as lost profits, reimbursement of development expenses 
and overhead costs, and the cost of efforts to protect the secret or recover damages, as well 
as for reduction in the value of business. Damages also can be measured by the defendant’s 
profits, which may be ordered to be paid to the plaintiff. Punitive damages and attorney’s 
fees also may be awarded. 
 
In addition to or in lieu of monetary damages, the plaintiff in a civil action for theft of trade 
secrets also may obtain an injunction prohibiting further use of the information. To obtain 
an injunction, the plaintiff must demonstrate that: 
• It is the proper owner of the trade secret 
• An unauthorized person has taken or used the trade secret 
• There is a high probability of improper disclosure 
• The plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury (meaning that the plaintiff could not be 
adequately compensated by monetary damages) 
• The plaintiff probably will win the case 
 
Injunctions have been issued in numerous trade secret cases to prevent the use of stolen 
information, to prohibit an employee in possession of a trade secret from accepting 
employment with a competitor, or to order the wrongdoer to return the misappropriated 
information. The injunction usually prohibits use of the trade secret only for that period it 
would have been required for its legitimate independent development. However, injunctions 
are difficult to obtain.
