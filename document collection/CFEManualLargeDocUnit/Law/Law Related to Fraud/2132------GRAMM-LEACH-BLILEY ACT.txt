GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT  
Like FACTA’s Red Flag Rules, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which protects customers’ 
financial information held by banks working in personal finance, imposes privacy obligations 
on financial institutions. Specifically, financial institutions have privacy obligations under the 
Financial Privacy Rule and the Safeguards Rule of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. 
 
The Financial Privacy Rule requires financial institutions to provide their customers with 
privacy notices explaining the institution’s policies for collecting and sharing personal 
financial information. The Financial Privacy Rule also applies to companies — whether or not 
they are financial institutions — that receive personal financial information. 
 
Conversely, the Safeguards Rule requires all financial institutions to design, implement, and 
maintain safeguards to protect the confidentiality and integrity of customers’ personal 
information. The Safeguards Rule applies not only to financial institutions that collect 
information from their own customers, but also to financial institutions that receive 
customer information from other financial institutions.
