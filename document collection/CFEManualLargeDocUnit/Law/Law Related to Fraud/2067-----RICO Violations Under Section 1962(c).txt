RICO Violations Under Section 1962(c) 
Section 1962(c) is probably the most commonly used provision. It makes it an offense for 
any person associated with an “enterprise” that is engaged in interstate commerce to 
participate in the affairs of such an enterprise through a “pattern of racketeering activity.” 
The elements of a section 1962(c) offense are: 
• The defendant was employed by or associated with an “enterprise” as defined in the 
statute, which can be a business, union, a group of individuals “associated in fact,” or 
even a single individual. 
• The enterprise was engaged in or affected interstate commerce. 
• The defendant conducted the affairs of the enterprise through a “pattern of racketeering 
activity,” that is, two or more illegal acts enumerated in the statute as predicate 
violations, such as mail and wire fraud or ITSP violations. 
 
EMPLOYED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH AN ENTERPRISE 
Under this element, the government must show that the defendant was directly involved in 
the management of the enterprise as an employee, officer, director, owner, or other person 
with substantial management authority. An outside consultant, accountant, or attorney who 
does not have substantial management authority is not liable. 
 
An enterprise includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association or other legal 
entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact, although not a legal entity. 
The enterprise should be an entity distinct from the “person” or “persons” who violate the 
statute. An enterprise includes both a legitimate and an illegal organization. 
 
ENGAGED IN INTERSTATE OR FOREIGN COMMERCE 
This element is met if the enterprise conducts business in or affects, even if only to a 
minimal extent, commerce or trade between two or more states or a foreign country. Proof 
of an effect on interstate commerce may be showing that the enterprise buys, sells, or 
transports goods or services in more than one state or a foreign country.

CONDUCTED THE AFFAIRS THROUGH A PATTERN OF RACKETEERING ACTIVITY 
The defendant violates this element if he has some involvement in the management or 
operation of the enterprise and in the commission of two or more “racketeering offenses” 
through the enterprise. The term racketeering activity  includes a broad assortment of state and 
federal crimes, such as bribery, extortion, bankruptcy fraud, mail fraud, and securities fraud. 
 
Pattern means at least two acts of racketeering activity, the last of which occurred within 10 
years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after a prior act. Proof of a pattern requires 
that the acts be connected in some manner and not be separate, isolated, or random crimes. 
Each act must have “continuity plus relationship,” that is, the same or a similar purpose, 
result, participants, victims, methods of commission, or be otherwise related.
