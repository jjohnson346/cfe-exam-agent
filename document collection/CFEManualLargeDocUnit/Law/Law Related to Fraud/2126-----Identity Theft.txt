Identity Theft  
Technological advancements facilitating the electronic transfer of personal and financial 
information have greatly contributed to the increasing occurrences of identity theft. Identity 
theft occurs when thieves wrongfully obtain and use another person’s personal data (i.e., 
name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, or credit card numbers) in a way that 
involves fraud or deception. There are two primary federal laws that address identity theft: 
the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act and the Identity Theft Penalty 
Enhancement Act. In addition, there are a number of state, federal, and regulatory data 
breach laws that require companies to inform consumers of data breaches without 
unreasonable delay.  
 
There are, however, other ancillary federal laws regarding fraud in various contexts that this 
section will not cover. These ancillary laws include the federal mail and wire fraud statutes, 
the access device fraud statute, federal statutes that prohibit fraud against banks or other 
similar financial institutions, and statutes prohibiting Social Security fraud.
