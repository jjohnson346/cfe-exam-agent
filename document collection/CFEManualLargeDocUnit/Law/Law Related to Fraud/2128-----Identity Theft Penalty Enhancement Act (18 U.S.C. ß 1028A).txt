Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act (18 U.S.C. § 1028A) 
In August 2004, Congress passed the Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act to deal with 
the increasing frequency of identity theft schemes. This Act strengthens federal law on 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.266  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
identity theft by creating a crime of “aggravated identity theft.” Aggravated identity theft 
occurs when an individual uses a stolen identity to commit other crimes. Specifically, section 
1028A provides that where one “knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful 
authority, a means of identification of another” during and in relation to any felony violation 
of/or relating to fraud, embezzlement, false statements, and the like, an additional term of 
imprisonment of two years will be imposed on the individual. In April 2005, the United 
States Sentencing Commission went a step further to impose consecutive mandatory 
minimum sentences of two and five years depending on the underlying offense of misusing a 
stolen identification. The statute also imposes a minimal sentence of two years of 
imprisonment to any punishment for a felony crime committed using a stolen identity.
