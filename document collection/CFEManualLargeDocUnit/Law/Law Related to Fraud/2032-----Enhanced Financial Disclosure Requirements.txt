Enhanced Financial Disclosure Requirements 
OFF-BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act directed the SEC to issue  rules that require the disclosure of all 
material off-balance sheet transactions by publicly traded companies. The rules require 
disclosure of “all material off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations 
(including contingent obligations), and other relationships the company may have with 
unconsolidated entities or persons that may have a material current or future effect on the 
company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, liquidity, capital expenditures, 
capital resources, or significant components of revenues or expenses.” These disclosures are 
required in all annual and quarterly SEC reports. 
 
PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 401 increases the type and extent of disclosures in periodic reports 
filed with the SEC. Under section 401, pro forma financials that are filed with the SEC or 
that are included in any public disclosure or press release must not contain any untrue 
statements or omissions that would make them misleading, and they must be reconciled to GAAP.  
 
PROHIBITIONS ON PERSONAL LOANS TO EXECUTIVES 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 402 makes it illegal for public companies to make personal loans or 
otherwise extend credit, either directly or indirectly, to or for any director or executive 
officer. An exception applies to consumer lenders if the loans are consumer loans of the type 
the company normally makes to the public and are on the same terms. 
 
RESTRICTIONS ON INSIDER TRADING 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 403 establishes disclosure requirements for stock transactions by 
directors and officers of public companies, or by persons who own more than 10 percent of 
a publicly traded company’s stock. SEC rules further specify content and timing

requirements of blackout period notices that must be provided to directors and officers. 
Reports of changes in beneficial ownership by these persons must now be filed with the 
SEC by the end of the second business day following the transaction. 
 
Under Sarbanes-Oxley section 306, directors and officers are also prohibited from trading in 
the company’s securities during any pension fund blackout periods. This restriction only 
applies to securities that were acquired because of their employment or service to the 
company. A blackout period is defined as any period of more than three consecutive 
business days in which at least 50 percent of the participants in the company’s retirement 
plan are restricted from trading in the company’s securities. If a director or officer violates 
this provision, he can be forced to disgorge to the company all profits received from the sale 
of securities during the blackout period. 
 
CODES OF ETHICS FOR SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS  
Pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley section 406 and SEC release No. 33-8177, public companies 
must disclose in their annual report whether they have adopted a code of ethics for senior 
financial officers, and if they have not, they must explain their reasoning.  
 
ENHANCED REVIEW OF PERIODIC FILINGS 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 408 requires the SEC to make regular and systematic reviews of 
disclosures made by public companies in their periodic reports to the SEC. Reviews of a 
company’s disclosures, including its financial statements, must be made at least once every 
three years. Prior to this enactment, reviews were typically minimal and tended to coincide 
with registered offerings. 
 
REAL TIME DISCLOSURES  
Under Sarbanes-Oxley section 409, public companies must publicly disclose information 
concerning material changes in their financial condition or operations. These disclosures 
must be “in plain English” and must be  made “on a rapid and current basis.”
