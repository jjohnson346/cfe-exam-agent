AUDIT OF RECORDS AND PREVENTION PROCEDURES 
The Anti-Kickback Act also provides for inspection by the Inspector General with access to 
books and records, and section 57 requires that the prime contractor have in place in its 
operations reasonable procedures to prevent and detect kickbacks. If a contractor has 
reasonable grounds to believe that there has been a violation, the contractor is required to 
report the possible violation. The contractor also is required to cooperate fully with any 
federal agency investigation. 
 
According to the congressional notes following the statute, “reasonable procedures to detect 
and prevent kickbacks” include: 
• Educational programs for employees and subcontractors 
• Policy manuals 
• Special procurement and audit procedures 
• Ethics policies 
• Applicant screening
