Enhanced Penalties for White-Collar Crime 
As part of Congress’ general effort to deter corporate accounting fraud and other forms of 
white-collar crime, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also enhances the criminal penalties for a number 
of white-collar offenses.  
 
ATTEMPT AND CONSPIRACY (18 U.S.C. § 1349) 
The Act amends the fraud provisions of the U.S. Code (Chapter 63) to make “attempt” and 
“conspiracy to commit” offenses subject to the same penalties as the offense itself. This 
applies to mail fraud, wire fraud, securities fraud, bank fraud, and health care fraud. The text 
of the statute provides: 
 
Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense under this chapter [U.S. Code 
Chapter 63] shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the 
commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy. 
 
MAIL FRAUD AND WIRE FRAUD 
Sarbanes-Oxley amends the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343), 
increasing the maximum jail term from five to 20 years.  
 
SECURITIES FRAUD  
Section 807 creates an additional securities fraud offence that can carry a maximum sentence 
of 25 years in prison. Specifically, this law imposes criminal liability for anyone who 
knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud in connection 
with registered securities.  
 
The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA), signed into law by President 
Obama on May 20, 2009, contains a number of measures intended to combat fraud. Among 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.227 
other provisions, the legislation expands the definition of securities fraud in section 1348 to 
include fraud schemes involving commodities for future delivery or options on commodities 
for future delivery. 
 
DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION   
Sarbanes-Oxley section 802 makes destroying evidence to obstruct an investigation or any 
other matter within the jurisdiction of any U.S. department illegal and punishable by a fine of 
up to $250,000 and up to 20 years in prison.  
 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 802 also specifically requires that accountants who perform audits 
on publicly traded companies maintain all audit or review work papers for a period of five 
years. Violations of this rule may be punished by fines up to $250,000 and up to 10 years in 
jail for individuals, or fines up to $500,000  for corporations. (Although Sarbanes-Oxley  
section 802 only requires work papers to be maintained for five years, keep in mind that 
under Sarbanes-Oxley section 103, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is 
directed to set standards that require public accounting firms to maintain audit work papers 
for seven years. Accounting firms should design their document retention policies 
accordingly.)  
 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 1102 amends section 1512 of the U.S. Code to make it a criminal 
offense to corruptly alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal a record or document with the intent 
to impair its integrity or use in an official proceeding, or to otherwise obstruct, influence, or 
impede any official proceeding or attempt to do so. Violations of this section are punishable 
by fines up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to 20 years.  
 
FREEZING OF ASSETS 
During an investigation of possible securities violations by a publicly traded company or any 
of its officers, directors, partners, agents, controlling persons, or employees, the SEC can 
petition a federal court to issue a 45-day freeze on “extraordinary payments” to any of the 
foregoing persons. If granted, the payments will be placed in an interest-bearing escrow 
account while the investigation commences. This provision was enacted to prevent 
corporate assets from being improperly distributed while an investigation is underway.  
 
BANKRUPTCY LOOPHOLES 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 803 amends the bankruptcy code so that judgments, settlements, 
damages, fines, penalties, restitution payments, disgorgement payments, etc., resulting from 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.228  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
violations of federal securities laws are nondischargeable. This was intended to prevent 
corporate wrongdoers from sheltering their assets under bankruptcy protection.  
 
DISGORGEMENT OF BONUSES 
One of the most unique aspects of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is section 304, which states that 
if a publicly traded company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the 
company’s material noncompliance (as a result of “misconduct”) with any financial reporting 
requirement under securities laws, then the CEO and CFO must reimburse the company for: 
• Any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation received during the 
12 months after the initial filing of the report that requires restating; and  
• Any profits realized from the sale of the company’s securities during the same 12-month 
period. 
 
While the Act requires the CEO and CFO to disgorge their bonuses if the company’s 
financial statements have to be restated because of “misconduct,” it makes no mention of 
whose misconduct triggers this provision. There is certainly nothing in the text of Sarbanes-
 Oxley section 304 that limits the disgorgement provision to instances of misconduct by the 
CEO and CFO. Presumably, then, the CEO and CFO could be required to disgorge their 
bonuses and profits from the sale of company stock even if they had no knowledge of and 
took no part in the misconduct that made the restatement necessary.
