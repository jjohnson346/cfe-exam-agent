Standards for Auditor Independence 
RESTRICTIONS ON NON-AUDIT ACTIVITY 
Perhaps the greatest concern arising out of the public accounting scandals of 2001 and 2002 
was the fear that public accounting firms that received multimillion-dollar consulting fees 
from their public company clients could not maintain an appropriate level of objectivity in 
conducting audits for those clients. To address this concern, Congress established section 
201, which provides a list of activities that public accounting firms are now prohibited from 
performing on behalf of their audit clients. The prohibited services include:  
• Bookkeeping services 
• Financial information systems design and implementation 
• Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contribution-in-kind reports 
• Actuarial services 
• Internal audit outsource services 
• Management functions or human resources 
• Broker or dealer, investment adviser, or investment banking services 
• Legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit 
• Any other service that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board proscribes 
 
There are certain other non-audit services — most notably tax services — that are not 
expressly prohibited by Sarbanes-Oxley. In order for a public accounting firm to perform 
these services on behalf of an audit client, however, that service must be approved in 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.222  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
advance by the client’s audit committee, which must be disclosed in the client’s periodic SEC 
reports. Furthermore, regarding non-audit services, the SEC prevents accounts from 
providing audit clients with expert opinions and services, as well as legal representation for 
advocating the audit client’s litigation, regulatory, or administrative interests. 
 
MANDATORY AUDIT PARTNER ROTATION 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 204 requires public accounting firms to rotate the lead audit partner 
or the partner responsible for reviewing the audit every five years.  
 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROVISIONS 
Another provision of Sarbanes-Oxley aimed at improving auditor independence is section 
206, which seeks to limit conflicts or potential conflicts that arise when auditors cross over 
to work for their former clients. The Act now makes it unlawful for a public accounting firm 
to audit a company if, within the prior year, the client’s CEO, CFO, controller, or chief 
accounting officer worked for the accounting firm and participated in the company’s audit.  
 
AUDITOR REPORTS TO AUDIT COMMITTEES 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 301 requires that auditors report directly to the audit committee, and 
section 204 makes certain requirements as to the contents of those reports. To help ensure 
that the audit committee is aware of questionable accounting policies or treatments that were 
used in the preparation of the company’s financial statements, Sarbanes-Oxley section 204 
states that auditors must make a timely report (before any report is filed with the SEC 
pursuant to the federal securities laws) of the following to the audit committee:  
• All critical accounting policies and policies used 
• Alternative GAAP methods that were discussed with management, the ramifications of 
the use of those alternative treatments, and the treatment preferred by the auditors 
• Any other material written communications between the auditors and management 
 
AUDITORS’ ATTESTATION TO INTERNAL CONTROLS 
As was stated previously, section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires every annual report 
to contain an internal control report which states that the company’s management is 
responsible for internal controls, and which also assesses the effectiveness of the internal 
control structures. Sarbanes-Oxley section 404 requires the company’s external auditors to 
attest to and issue a report on management’s assessment of internal controls.

IMPROPER INFLUENCE ON AUDITS 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also makes it unlawful for any officer or director of a public 
company to take any action to fraudulently influence, coerce, manipulate, or mislead an 
auditor in the performance of an audit of the company’s financial statements. This is yet 
another attempt by Congress to ensure the independence and objectivity of audits to prevent 
accounting fraud and strengthen investor confidence in the reliability of public company 
financial statements.
