THE LAW RELATED TO FRAUD (PART 2) 
 
Federal Legislation Related to Fraud (Cont.) 
 
Laws Relating to Mortgage Fraud 
Introduction to the Mortgage Industry 
After the U.S. housing market collapsed during the Great Depression, Congress created the 
National Housing Act to strengthen the deeply troubled housing market. An important 
element of this legislation was to make mortgage funds available to more Americans by 
protecting lenders from the risk of default loans. 
 
To this end, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was created through this Act with 
the following goals: 
• To provide mortgage insurance on residential loans, thus affording lenders protection 
against losses as the result of homeowner default. Lenders would bear less risk because 
the FHA would pay claims to the lender in the event of a default. 
• To regulate the rate of interest and the terms of mortgages that it insured. 
 
Similarly, the Veteran’s Administration (VA) Home Loan Guaranty Service was founded in 
1944 to assist veterans in purchasing homes. VA loans were also insured against default by 
the U.S. government. 
 
In 1937, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) was chartered by the 
FHA. Fannie Mae was created to purchase FHA-guaranteed loans in the secondary market 
and pool them for sale as mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) to investors on the open 
market. 
 
However, as recently as 1968, there was no secondary market for nongovernment loans (also 
called conventional loans). Banks still carried conventional loans in their portfolios, and 
accessibility to conventional loans by homeowners was still largely dictated by local 
economies and markets. A secondary market for conventional loans was needed to stabilize 
the conventional lending market. This could be done by adding liquidity so that there would 
be a steady supply of funds available to lenders who originated conventional loans. 
 
In 1968, Fannie Mae’s charter was amended to allow purchases of conventional mortgages in 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.302  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
the secondary market. Congress chartered the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Company 
(Freddie Mac) in 1970 as an additional resource for purchasing conventional mortgages at a 
time when demand was high for savings-and-loan financing. 
 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are shareholder-owned, publicly traded, profit-making 
corporations — or government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) — regulated by the Office of 
Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). GSEs have loan limits established by law 
and set each January by Congress. 
 
In 1968, along with amending Fannie Mae’s charter, Congress established the Government 
National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) as a government-owned corporation within the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Lenders pool packages of 
qualifying FHA or VA mortgages and convert them into securities, and Ginnie Mae 
guarantees investors the timely payment of principal and interest on these securities. 
 
A final component of the secondary market comprises private investors, such as Wall Street 
firms. Because GSEs typically underwrite prime loans only, private investors are the main 
secondary market for subprime loans. Secondary market investors play an important role in 
dictating loan products, as lenders use secondary market underwriting guidelines to ensure 
the ability to sell loans to these investors. Each investor’s guidelines vary. 
 
In 2007, however, an increasing number of borrowers, particularly those with adjustable rate 
mortgages, were unable to pay their mortgages, causing a sharp increase in home 
foreclosures. As a result, real estate prices began to fall, causing an increase in losses for 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Because of the potential liabilities facing each company, 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into a government conservatorship, which is 
similar to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, under the Federal Housing Finance Agency, a 
government agency responsible for overseeing the two entities.  
 
The Evolution of Mortgage Lenders and Brokers 
MORTGAGE LENDERS  
Today, the secondary market has overtaken deposit gathering as the source of funding for 
mortgage lending. Loans are sold in the secondary market at origination, thereby providing 
the bank with a steady supply of capital needed to make additional loans. Without the need 
for a lot of capital (deposits on the books), mortgage lenders started to evolve.  
 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.303 
Consequently, a smaller percentage of bankers are keeping their loans than in the past. Even 
large commercial banks with lending authority and capital now sell the mortgage loan 
transactions they originate and close. Few banks wish to rely on depositors’ money to fund 
mortgage loans.  
 
Additionally, many mortgage lenders are non-depository institutions rather than locally 
headquartered depository banks. Mortgage lenders do not take deposits. Instead they rely on 
the stability the secondary market has provided to purchase loans at origination, and to repay 
the bank monies to use for future mortgage loan originations. 
 
MORTGAGE BROKERS 
Historically, mortgage loans were originated by the loan officer at the bank. Mortgage 
lenders, however, started relying on third-party originators (TPOs) to broker their loan 
products. Brokers could be paid a commission rather than a salary, an option that worked 
well for minimally capitalized mortgage lenders.  
 
As a result, the industry has seen the evolution of mortgage brokers.  
 
As markets for mortgages became more competitive, banks with their own retail loan 
officers also started employing these third-party wholesale originators. Today, mortgage 
brokers are the largest distributors of mortgage products for mortgage lenders and banks. It 
is estimated that two-thirds of all originations are from wholesale TPO mortgage brokers 
rather than retail loan officers. 
 
Legislation and Regulation in the Mortgage Industry 
The increase in the incidence, cost, and victims of mortgage fraud has spurred the 
government and the mortgage industry to respond. Lawmakers have introduced additional 
legislation at the federal and state levels to curb mortgage fraud and other high-risk products 
and practices, such as predatory and subprime lending. Industry professionals and regulators 
are also reacting with ways to combat mortgage fraud. 
 
  
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law

FEDERAL LEGISLATION ADDRESSING MORTGAGE FRAUD 
The following federal statutes are commonly used to prosecute mortgage fraud:  
 
18 U.S.C. § 1341 Mail fraud 
18 U.S.C. § 1342 Use of fictitious name or address in fraud 
18 U.S.C. § 1343 Wire fraud 
18 U.S.C. § 1344 Bank fraud 
18 U.S.C. § 1014 False statements on a loan or credit application 
18 U.S.C. § 1028 Fraud and related activities in connection with identity theft 
18 U.S.C. § 1029 Credit card fraud 
18 U.S.C. § 1030 Computer fraud 
18 U.S.C. § 1349 Conspiracy 
18 U.S.C. § 1519 Obstruction of justice 
18 U.S.C. § 1956 Money laundering 
18 U.S.C. § 1957 Monetary transactions with illegal proceeds 
18 U.S.C. § 1001 False statements or entries (generally) 
18 U.S.C. § 1005 False entries to federally insured institutions 
18 U.S.C. § 1010 False statements in HUD transactions 
18 U.S.C. § 408 Fraud in connection with Social Security identification documents 
18 U.S.C. § 1961 Criminal RICO 
18 U.S.C. § 215 Receipt of commissions or gifts for procuring loans 
18 U.S.C. § 371 Conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud the United States 
18 U.S.C. § 656 Theft, embezzlement, or  misapplication by a bank officer or 
employee 
18 U.S.C. § 2314 Transportation of stolen goods or securities 
18 U.S.C. § 1341 Mail fraud 
 
In addition, on May 20, 2009, President Obama signed the Fraud Enforcement and 
Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA) into law. This comprehensive legislation expands the reach of 
federal law and increases funding for federal agencies to investigate and prosecute mortgage, 
corporate, and other financial frauds.  
 
Concerning its application to mortgage fraud, FERA makes a number of important changes 
to federal law. Most importantly, FERA expands the definition of financial institution in the 
criminal code (18 U.S.C. § 20 ), thereby extending federal fraud laws to mortgage-lending 
businesses not directly regulated or insured by the federal government. By amending the 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.305 
definition of financial institution, FERA expands the Department of Justice’s authority to 
prosecute mortgage fraud cases as bank fraud and to seek enhanced penalties under the mail 
and wire fraud statutes. As a result, convictions for mortgage fraud can now carry a 30-year 
maximum prison sentence, a maximum $1 million fine, or both.  
 
FERA also amends the false statement in mortgage applications statute (18 U.S.C. § 1014) to 
make it a crime to make a materially false statement or to willfully overvalue a property to 
influence any action by a mortgage-lending business. 
 
PREDATORY LENDING LEGISLATION  
Predatory lending is a term generally used to characterize a range of abusive and aggressive 
lending practices, including deception and fraud, without any benefit to the borrower. 
Although a few federal laws implicate predatory mortgage-lending practices, the only act 
Congress enacted specifically to address predatory lending was section 32 of the Truth in 
Lending Act, entitled the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA) (5 U.S.C. § 1639).  
 
Note: The rules of HOEPA protect refinancing and home equity installment loans; they do 
not protect loans to buy or build a home, reverse mortgages, or home equity credit lines.  
 
HOEPA attempts to regulate certain high-cost, potentially predatory mortgage loans, and its 
protections are triggered by home loans that 1) have an annual percentage rate (APR) that is 
eight percent higher than an index tied to Treasury securities or 2) have fees that exceed 
eight percent of the loan total or $583, whichever is greater. However, predatory lenders 
easily evade HOEPA’s protections by imposing charges and fees just below the threshold. 
Thus, very few predatory loans are subject to HOEPA’s regulations. 
 
On July 18, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board approved a rule under HOEPA to protect 
consumers from unfair or deceptive home mortgage lending and advertising practices. The 
rule will take effect on October 1, 2009, and will specifically: 
• Prohibit creditors from extending credit without considering the borrowers’ ability to 
repay; 
• Require creditors to verify income and assets they rely upon in making a loan; 
• Restrict the circumstances under which prepayment penalties are permitted; and  
• Require creditors to establish escrow accounts for taxes and insurance.

2.306  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
SUBPRIME LENDING LEGISLATION  
Subprime lending  is the practice of extending credit to borrowers who have certain credit 
characteristics — such as a lower credit score or poor payment history—that disqualify them 
from loans at the prime rate. Currently, there is no federal legislation governing subprime 
lending. But Congress has recently introduced a variety of legislative proposals designed to 
address the problems faced by subprime borrowers. For instance, the rules under HOEPA 
issued by the Federal Reserve Board are designed to increase borrower protections from 
abusive lending practices. The regulations would, among other things, limit various acts and 
practices in mortgage loans with annual percentage of rates exceeding a lower trigger. 
 
STATE LEGISLATION 
As with federal law, many states have enacted legislation related to mortgage fraud and 
predatory lending practices. 
 
MORTGAGE FRAUD STATUTES  
In May 2005, Georgia became the first state to make mortgage fraud a crime. Since then, 
Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, 
Utah, and Washington have also passed mortgage fraud laws.3 
 
PREDATORY LENDING LAWS  
In the past five years, more than half the states in the United States have taken steps to limit 
predatory lending practices, and seven have placed a ban on prepayment penalties. Localities 
in some states have also passed ordinances dealing with predatory lending practices. 
 
Victims of predatory lending practices should contact their state Attorney General’s office. 
The U.S. Office of the Attorney General consolidates individual states’ actions against 
predatory lending practices. Two additional predatory lending resources are: 
• The National Association of Attorneys General (www.naag.org) 
• The Center for Responsible Lending ( www.responsiblelending.org)  
 
MORTGAGE INDUSTRY REGULATION  
The mortgage industry used to be highly regulated. However, current non-depository 
mortgage lenders are not federally regulated or insured; instead, they are regulated at the 
                                                 
3 National Conference of State Legislatures, “Mortgage Fraud.” http://www.ncsl.org. 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.307 
state level. As a result, some mortgage lenders are federally regulated while others are 
regulated by the state in which they are chartered.  
 
FEDERAL REGULATION  
Banks, or depository institutions, that maintain a mortgage-lending function or subsidiary fall 
under regulation from one of the following federal regulators: 
• The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which charters, regulates, and 
supervises more than 2,500 national banks and their subsidiaries, as well as the federal 
branches and agencies of foreign banks 
• The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the 
Treasury, which regulates all federally chartered and some state-charted thrift 
institutions, including federally chartered savings and loan associations and savings banks 
and their subsidiaries 
• The National Credit Union Association (NCUA), which regulates federally chartered 
credit unions and all credit unions chartered in Delaware, South Dakota, Wyoming, and 
the District of Columbia 
• The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which regulates its state-
 chartered member banks, their subsidiaries, and holding companies, as well as the 
activities of foreign banks that operate within the United States 
 
NATIONAL LICENSING SYSTEM FOR MORTGAGE LOAN OFFICERS  
In 2005, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and the American Association of 
Residential Mortgage Regulators (AARMR), along with state mortgage regulators, began 
creating a tool that would turn the table on criminals who exploit the complex mortgage 
origination system. State regulators agreed to a single set of uniform applications, including 
assigning a unique identifying number that tracks the entity or individual from state to state 
and over time. The resulting system—the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System 
(NMLS) — offers the industry a single location for ascertaining license status and finding any 
enforcement actions. The system began operating on January 2, 2008; by the end of 2010, 49 
of the U.S. states, as well as Puerto Rico, will have implemented use of the NMLS for 
mortgage licensing. 
 
STATE REGULATION  
New mortgage lenders that are non-depository are regulated by the state of their charter. 
State-chartered mortgage lenders are exempt from federal regulation, and regulation varies 
from state to state. In 1993, only 18 states directly regulated their mortgage lending industry; 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.308  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
however, today, all 50 states have statutes directly regulating the mortgage-lending industry 
in some capacity. 
 
Until recently, there were no national standards for the licensing and oversight of mortgage 
brokers. But on July 30, 2008, President Bush signed into law the Secure and Fair 
Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act), which is part of the Housing 
and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. Designed to provide uniform licensing standards 
nationwide, the SAFE Act requires all states to have in place a system of licensure meeting 
minimum standards for mortgage loan originators (i.e., anyone who takes a residential 
mortgage loan application or who offers or negotiates terms of a residential mortgage loan 
application for compensation or gain) by July 31, 2009.  
 
At a minimum, the state’s licensing system must meet all of the following requirements: 
• Screen individuals for felonies in the last seven years 
• Screen individuals for previous license revocations 
• Require proof of financial responsibility using a credit report 
• Require pre-license testing and education 
• Require continuing education 
• Provide for license renewals on an annual basis 
• Include a bond, net worth, or recovery fund 
 
Federal Laws Relating to Credit Reports 
The loan approval process begins with the credit of the borrower. Lenders rely on a credit 
report to assess the creditworthiness of a borrower and establish whether he will repay a 
loan. A credit report is typically one of the first things that a loan officer will obtain when 
qualifying a borrower. Typically, a borrower’s credit is highly related to the probability that 
the loan will go into default. Because higher credit scores tend to raise fewer red flags, 
perpetrators prey on borrowers with high credit scores. 
 
Credit reports are provided by credit bureaus, also known as credit reporting agencies. Credit 
bureaus are local or national institutions that collect data on individual consumer 
creditworthiness and report that data to their members or subscribers; however, their 
members or subscribers may only request and use the information provided for those 
purposes allowed by law.  
 
One of the primary statutes limiting access to information is the Fair Credit Reporting Act 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.309 
(15 U.S.C. § 1681b). This Act provides the permissible purposes for obtaining a credit 
report, such as credit evaluation, insurance, employment, or similar purposes. More 
specifically, it regulates the type of information that can be contained in a consumer credit 
report, it restricts credit bureaus from releasing an individual’s credit information to any 
third parties without authorization, and it sets forth the circumstances under which a third-
 party can obtain a copy of the report. For more information about this Act, see the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act section in the “Individual Rights” chapter.  
 
In addition, privacy rules implemented as part of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (16 C.F.R. 
Part 313) have been interpreted to prevent the selling of credit header information (including 
names, addresses, phone numbers, and Social Security numbers). This prevents credit 
bureaus from selling such information to private investigators, direct marketers, or other 
information brokers.  
 
Telemarketing Fraud 
Telemarketing fraud refers to any type of scheme that is perpetrated over the telephone, and 
these schemes may be prosecuted under sections 2325–2327 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code. 
For purposes of this statute, telemarketing  is defined as: 
 
[A] plan, program, promotion or campaign that is conducted to induce — 
(A) purchases of goods or services; or 
(B) participation in a contest or sweepstakes, 
by use of 1 or more interstate telephone calls initiated either by a person who is conducting the 
plan, program, promotion, or campaign or by a prospective purchaser or contest or sweepstakes 
participant … 
 
The definition contains an exclusion for the solicitation of sales through direct mail catalogs 
when the calls are initiated by the customer. 
 
The statute does not specifically outlaw telemarketing fraud. Instead, the statute provides 
enhanced penalties for persons convicted of identity fraud, fraud in connection with access 
devices, mail fraud, or wire fraud if that offense was committed in connection with the 
conduct of “telemarketing.” If a person is c onvicted of one of the listed offenses through 
the use of telemarketing, then the statute provides that up to five years shall be added to the 
person’s sentence. It also provides that if the victims were over the age of 55, then the 
person shall be sentenced to up to 10 additional years. Section 2327 directs the judge to 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.310  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
order mandatory restitution in all cases. The courts are also allowed to seize any property 
used to commit the crime, as well as any proceeds of the crime. 
 
In addition to charges brought under these provisions, federal prosecutors often use other 
fraud-related laws to prosecute telemarketing fraud, including charges of money-laundering 
(18 U.S.C. §§ 1956 and 1957); credit card fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1029); and bank fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1344). 
 
Access Device Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1029) 
This statute criminalizes the production, use, trafficking, or possession of unauthorized or 
counterfeit access devices. Access devices are devices that allow access to account funds. 
Most importantly, section 1029 prohibits the fraudulent use of credit cards. However, 
because Congress broadly defined the term access devices, section 1029 also applies to crimes 
using other access device numbers, including debit cards, ATM cards, personal identification 
numbers (PINs), computer passwords, “or any other thing of value, or that can be used to 
initiate a transfer of funds (other than a transfer originated solely by paper instrument).”  
 
Section 1029 includes penalties of up to 15 years (up to 20 years for subsequent offenses) 
and/or fines. Additionally, forfeiture of personal property is available in many instances.  
 
Computer Crime  
Computer crime is a relatively new and somewhat amorphous term referring to both cases in 
which a computer is the instrument of a crime and those in which it is the object. As the 
instrument, for example, a computer might be used to direct calls in a scheme to sell shares 
in a nonexistent gold mine or might be used to steal funds from a bank account. As the 
object of a crime, the information contained in a computer might be stolen or destroyed. 
(The Financial Transactions section contains further information on computer crime.) 
 
Most computer crimes are prosecuted under traditional fraud, theft, and embezzlement 
statutes, but section 1030 of Title 18, U.S. Code, makes certain computer-related activity a 
specific federal offense.  
 
Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Computers (18 U.S.C. § 1030) 
Originally enacted in 1986, this section, know n as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, was 
amended by the Computer Abuse Amendments Act of 1994. Most relevant to fraud 
examiners is subsection (a), which prohibits seven acts involving “protected computers.”  
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.311 
A protected computer, under this section, includes: 
• A computer that is used exclusively by a financial institution or the U.S. government 
• Any computer whose use affects a computer used by a financial institution or the federal 
government 
• A computer that is used in interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including 
a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects 
interstate or foreign commerce of the United States 
 
Briefly put, section 1030(a) prohibits using a protected computer: 
• To commit espionage (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(1)) 
• To obtain, without authorization, certain government, financial institution, or 
commercial information (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2)) 
• To access, without authorization, a government computer (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(3)) 
• To commit fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4)) 
• To transmit a program, code, or command to damage a protected computer or to access 
a protected computer that results in damage (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)) 
• For trafficking in passwords (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(6)) 
• To transmit extortionate threats (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(7)) 
 
Section 1030(a)(4) and section 1030(a)(5), are discussed in further detail below. 
 
Federal and state legislatures are moving quickly to make criminal all manner of computer 
fraud and abuses, such as hardware theft and destruction, misappropriation of software, 
unauthorized accessing of computers and data communications facilities to steal data or 
money or to cause mischief. 
 
COMPUTER FRAUD (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4)) 
Section 1030(a)(4) outlaws fraud involving protected computers. There are three elements of 
the crime, which include: 
• Knowingly accessing a protected computer without authorization (or exceeding 
authorization) 
• With the intent to defraud 
• And thereby obtaining anything of value (more than $5,000 over the course of a year) 
 
Furthermore, violations of section 1030(a)(4) may implicate other related federal laws, 
including, but not limited to:  
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.312  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• Wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) 
• Theft of trade secrets (18 U.S.C. § 1832) 
• Fraud involving credit cards and access devices (18 U.S.C. § 1029) 
• False statements on a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency or department (18 U.S.C. § 1001) 
• False statements on federally insured loan and credit applications (18 U.S.C. § 1014) 
• False claims against the United States (18 U.S.C. § 287) 
• Bank fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1344) 
• Theft or embezzlement by officer or employee of lending, credit, and insurance 
institutions (18 U.S.C. § 657) 
• False entries by bank officers or employees (18 U.S.C. § 1005) 
• False entries by officers or employees of federal credit institutions (18 U.S.C. § 1006) 
• Copyright infringement (18 U.S.C. § 2319) 
• Money laundering (18 U.S.C. §§ 1956–1957) 
• Racketeering (18 U.S.C. § 1962) 
 
CAUSING COMPUTER DAMAGE (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)) 
Section 1030(a)(5) outlaws causing computer damage, but it contains two categories of 
offense, depending on intent. The first category provides that it is illegal to knowingly 
transmit a program, code, or command that intentionally causes damage to a protected 
computer. This offense applies even if the individual had authorization to access the 
computer.  
 
The second category provides that it is illegal to access a protected computer, without 
authorization, that results in damage. Unlike the first category, this offense does not require 
intent to damage — only the intent to access the information.  
 
Unlawful actions under the first category of section 1030(a)(5) violations include 
imprisonment up to one year and/or a fine. Violators under the second category of section 
1030(a)(5) may receive up to five years of imprisonment (not more than 10 years for repeat 
offenders) and/or a fine. Both categories provide a civil remedy for any person who suffers 
damage as a result of a violation of section 1030(a)(5).  
 
To apply, section 1030(a)(5) requires that the defendant’s conduct “cause” damage to a 
computer. Due to its broadness, the definition allows section 1030(a)(5) to apply in various 
situations, including instances where an act causes information to be deleted or changed, 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.313 
where an intruder alters the way a computer operates, or where an act makes information 
unavailable. Even if an intruder did not make any alterations and the computer system works 
as it did before, some courts have ruled that accessing and copying private data from 
protected computers may cause damage to the data under section 1035(a)(5). For example, in 
the case of Shurgard Storage v. Safeguard Self Storage, 119 F. Supp. 2d 1121 (W.D. Wash. 2000), a 
U.S. District Court held that the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act could be used against an 
employee who, without permission, copied information from his employer’s computer and 
sent it by e-mail to a company that subsequently employed him. 
 
CIVIL REMEDIES AVAILABLE UNDER THE COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT 
Section 1030(g) provides a civil remedy for any person who suffers “damage or loss” under 
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Under section 1030(g), an “individual” may “obtain 
compensatory damages and injunctive relief or other equitable relief,” including all costs, 
consequential damages, and lost revenue. For purposes of establishing loss, the Patriot Act 
made it clear that the term individual includes any individual, firm, corporation, educational 
institution, financial institution, governmental entity, legal entity, or other entity. Damages 
under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act are defined as “any impairment to the integrity or 
availability of data, a program, a system, or information.” 
 
Employers have been “increasingly taking advantage of … [the Computer Fraud and Abuse 
Act’s] civil remedies to sue former employees and their new companies who seek a 
competitive edge through wrongful use of information from the former employer’s 
computer system” ( Pacific Aerospace and Elec tronics Inc. v. Taylor, 295 F. Supp. 2d 1188, 1196 
(E.D. Wash. 2003)). To recover under section 1030(g), the employer must show that the 
employee’s access to the company computers was “without authorization” or exceeded 
authorized access.  
 
The leading case for using this Act against employees who steal company data is Int’l Airport 
Centers LLC v. Citrin, 440 F.3d 418 (7th Circ. 2006). Based on agency principles, the 7th 
Circuit held that when the defendant breaches his duty of loyalty (i.e., accesses his 
employer’s computer to steal data), he terminates his agency relationship and loses all rights 
and authority to access the computer.  
 
At the time of this writing, however, there are several reported district courts that refuse to 
apply the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to employee data thieves. These courts hold that

2.314  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
the Act does not apply in these situations because employees have permission to access the 
company computers.  
 
Despite the split among federal courts, a method to avert relying only on agency principles in 
filing a section 1030(g) action is to establish unauthorized access through employee 
agreements and company policies.   
 
COMMON CRIMES PROSECUTED UNDER THE COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT 
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is the most notable federal law used to prosecute 
computer-related crimes. Most commonly, federal prosecutors use the Act to prosecute the 
following crimes: 
• Instances in which a computer is the subject of a crime, including computer viruses, time 
bombs, Trojans, malicious code, spam, botnets, logic bombs, rootkits, hacking, 
vandalism, WiFi mooching, extortion, and so forth. 
• Crimes that target computer networks (e.g., hacks, worms, and DDoS) 
• Computer fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4)) 
• Identity theft (18 U.S.C. § 1028) 
• Money laundering (18 U.S.C. §§ 1956-1957) 
• Intellectual property crimes 
 
State Laws 
At the state level, statutes that might be of use in prosecuting computer crimes would 
include the penal code violations of larceny (in its many forms), false pretenses, forgery, 
fraud, embezzlement, vandalism, property destruction, malicious mischief, proprietary 
information, theft, commercial bribery, and extortion. However, most states now expressly 
provide penalties for crimes perpetrated by use of computers or perpetrated against 
computers.

Internet Crime 
At the current time, there are no federal laws aimed specifically at fraud or other illegal 
activities conducted over the Internet. Many of the existing laws, however, can be used to 
prosecute Internet fraud as well as more traditional fraud schemes. The table below

Can-Spam Act (18 U.S.C. § 1037) 
The Can-Spam Act, or the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and 
Marketing Act, attempts to reduce the amount of unsolicited commercial e-mail, which is 
also known as spam, by establishing national standards for sending e-mail solicitations. To 
reduce the amount of spam, the Can-Spam Act provides several provisions that apply to 
individuals or companies sending spam. More specifically, the Act prohibits several 
deceptive and/or fraudulent practices commonly used in spam, including the prohibition of 
using deceptive subject lines, using deceptive header information, and requiring sender 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.318  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
identification. Penalties under the Can-Spam Act include punishment by a fine and/or 
imprisonment for not more than five years.  
 
In addition to prosecuting deceptive spam, federal prosecutors have used the Can-Spam Act 
to prosecute individuals engaged in phishing. Phishing occurs when a sender dupes 
individuals or businesses into providing sensitive data by falsely claiming to be from an 
actual business, bank, ISP, or other entity with whom the victim does business. 
 
Mail and Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343) 
As noted above, a computer may be the tool used to commit traditional crimes, including 
mail and wire fraud. Due to the broad reach of the mail and wire fraud statutes, prosecutors 
may use these traditional criminal statutes to prosecute computer fraud. In basic terms, the 
laws prohibit the use of mail or wires, including the Internet, in furtherance of a fraudulent 
scheme designed to obtain money or property. In fact, several cases have held that the 
federal mail and wire fraud statues apply to computer fraud.  
 
Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986   
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA), codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 
2510–2521, 2701–2710, 3121–3126, governs the illegal interception of electronic 
communication and the unauthorized access of electronically stored data.  
 
The ECPA is divided into three parts: the Wiretap Act, which governs the interception of 
electronic communications; the Stored Communications Act, which covers access to stored 
communications and records; and the Pen Register Act, which regulates pen registers and 
trap and trace devices. This section focuses on the Wiretap Act and the Stored 
Communications Act. 
 
THE WIRETAP ACT (18 U.S.C. §§ 2510–2521) 
In response to an increase in privacy breaches, Congress enacted the Wiretap Act, which 
prohibits anyone from intentionally intercepting or attempting to intercept any wire, oral, or 
electronic communication. Under the ECPA, electronic communications are defined as “any 
transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature 
transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic, or photo 
optical system that affects interstate or foreign commerce.” 
 
Focusing on its applicability to computer fraud, section 2511 prohibits covert spying on 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.319 
voice and data communications, extending protection from eavesdropping on mail and 
telephone communications to include digital data communications, such as e-mail and 
remote computing; it does not govern stored communications. But because most courts 
agree that interception does not occur when an individual obtains access to an electronically 
stored copy of the communication, the Wiretap Act is often inadequate to protect electronic 
communications sent over the Internet. For example, the Wiretap Act is often unsuccessful 
in combating spyware. Although spyware’s main function is to make unauthorized 
interceptions of electronic communication, spyware developers typically design spyware to 
evade the Wiretap Act’s reach by engineering the software to record electronic information 
while it is temporarily stored before, after, or during transmission.  
 
The Wiretap Act is discussed in more detail in the “Individual Rights” chapter below. 
 
THE STORED COMMUNICATIONS ACT (18 U.S.C. § 2701) 
As part of the ECPA, Congress enacted the Stored Communications Act (SCA) to protect 
stored electronic communications, such as e-mail and voicemail, by prohibiting the 
unauthorized access of such communications that are in storage. More specifically, the SCA 
prohibits unlawful access to a facility, which provides an electronic communication service, 
and, then, obtaining, altering, or preventing authorized access to a wire or electronic 
communication while it is electronically stored in such a system. An electronic 
communication falls under the SCA once a system receives and stores it.   
 
The SCA is discussed in more detail in the “Individual Rights” chapter below. 
 
Identifying and Protecting Trade Secrets 
In addition to recognizing ownership rights in material possessions, U.S. law grants rights in 
intangible property. Intellectual property rights create incentives for individuals, companies, 
and investors to allocate the requisite resources to research, develop, and market original 
technology and creative works. Federal law protects intellectual property in four specific 
areas: copyright, trademark, patent, and trades ecrets. Trade secrets will be the focus of this 
section.  
 
Protection against trade secret theft, also known as economic and corporate espionage, 
involves implementing and increasing controls, as well as establishing defenses to trade 
secret intrusion. Trade secrets include, but are not limited to, customer lists, vendor 
contracts, blueprints and construction plans, bidding systems, computer programs, test data, 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.320  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
pricing information, recipes, marketing plans, manufacturing processes, and business forms. 
Essentially, any idea or information that gives its owner an advantage over its competitors 
can be classified as a trade secret, as long as it generally meets the two criteria set forth 
below. 
 
To qualify as a trade secret, information must generally meet two criteria. First, it must 
actually be a “secret.” In other words, a company cannot sue an employee or competitor for 
releasing information that was already well known and readily available. Second, 
organizations are required to take reasonable steps to protect their trade secrets from 
disclosure. Trade secret protection for a piece of information will not exist where the 
information has been publicly disclosed or where the organization that owns the secret has 
not taken adequate steps to protect it from disclosure. 
 
Organizations and individuals can maintain legal protection over trade secrets by taking 
reasonable steps to keep all proprietary information secret. It is imperative that plans are 
developed to reasonably guard trade secrets from disclosure. The use of nondisclosure and 
noncompetition agreements can provide employers with legal recourse against those who 
misappropriate proprietary information.  
 
Nondisclosure agreements typically stipulate that all trade secrets and other proprietary or 
confidential information shall be kept confidential without disclosure to anyone. These 
agreements should be signed at the outset and upon termination of employment. 
Noncompetition agreements generally forbid a current employee from working for 
competing companies within a certain period from termination. Many state courts void such 
agreements as against “public policy” because they limit future employment of a person. 
Those states that do allow noncompetition agreements require the agreement to be part of 
an otherwise valid employment agreement. However, in cases where an employee is hired “at 
will,” noncompetition agreements are unenforceable. 
 
Congress has recognized the sanctity of trade secrets in numerous statutes. This section will 
provide an overview of the most relevant legal instruments developed to combat this form 
of white-collar crime. Specifically, this section will examine the following federal legislation: 
• Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. §§ 1831–1839) 
• Disclosing government trade secrets (18 U.S.C. § 1905) 
• Interstate transportation and receipt of stolen property or goods (18 U.S.C. § 2314) 
• Mail or wire fraud (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343) 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.321 
• Computer Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)) 
 
In addition, this section will examine the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA).  
 
Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. §§ 1831–1839) 
The Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (EEA) made the theft of trade secrets a federal 
criminal offense. The Department of Justice now has sweeping authority to prosecute trade 
secret theft whether it is in the United States, via the Internet, or outside the United States. 
 
Section 1839 defines trade secrets as any secret “patterns, plans, compilations, program 
devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, 
programs, or codes” that have some independ ent economic value and are used to obtain an 
economic advantage over competitors or customers. Furthermore, the EEA applies to 
anyone who, without authorization, copies, duplicates, “downloads, uploads, alters, destroys 
... replicates, transmits, delivers, sends, mails, communicates, or conveys a trade secret.” 
 
The EEA outlaws two types of trade secret misappropriation: economic espionage and theft 
of commercial trade secrets. Section 1831 criminalizes the theft of a trade secret to benefit a 
foreign government, instrumentality, or agent. Section 1832, however, criminalizes the theft 
of commercial trade secrets to obtain an economic advantage. Both sections are examined in 
more detail below.  
 
Prosecutors can apply the EEA to a wide variety of misconduct because it criminalizes 
attempts and conspiracies to violate the EEA. The same penalties apply to these offenses 
with increased penalties if the trade secret misappropriation benefits a foreign government, 
foreign instrumentality, or a foreign agent.  
 
Section 1834 of the EEA allows criminal forfeiture to the United States of (1) any property 
constituting or derived from the proceeds of violations of the Act, and (2) the forfeiture of 
any property used or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit or facilitate a 
violation of the Act. (See 18 U.S.C. § 1834.) The criminal forfeiture provisions enable federal 
prosecutors to dismantle entire Internet networks and seek criminal forfeiture of all the 
computers, printers and other devices used to commit or facilitate the offenses proscribed by 
the Act.  
 
The EEA also authorizes the attorney general, deputy attorney general, or assistant attorney 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.322  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
general in the Criminal Division of the Justice Department to apply for a federal court order 
authorizing or approving the interception of wire or oral communications by the FBI or 
other federal agencies having responsibility for the investigation of the offense. These are the 
same investigative tools available in other federal criminal prosecutions. 
 
The EEA also applies to offenses committed outside the United States if (1) the offender is 
a citizen or permanent resident alien of the United States, (2) if the corporation or other 
organization was incorporated or organized in the United States, or (3) an act in furtherance 
of the offense was committed in the United States. See  18 U.S.C. § 1837. These 
extraterritorial provisions in the Act will provide the Justice Department with broad 
authority to prosecute the international theft of trade secrets and will prevent the willful 
evasion of liability for trade secret misappropriation by using the Internet or other means to 
transfer the trade secret information outside the United States. 
 
Moreover, the EEA authorizes the attorney general to commence a civil action seeking 
injunctive relief to prevent further disclosure of a trade secret by the defendant or third 
parties. See 18 U.S.C. § 1836. There is no requirement in  the Act that criminal indictments be 
issued first. Therefore, the Justice Department  may commence civil actions for injunctive 
relief at any stage of the investigation. In any prosecution or other proceeding under the Act, 
the Court is required to issue protective orders and to take such other action as be necessary 
to preserve the confidentiality of the trade secrets consistent with the Federal Rules of 
Criminal and Civil Procedure. See  18 U.S.C. § 1835. 
 
Finally, violations under the EEA may implicate other federal laws, including: 
• Disclosing government trade secrets (18 U.S.C. § 1905) 
• Interstate transportation and receipt of stolen property or goods (18 U.S.C. § 2314) 
• Mail or wire fraud (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343) 
• Computer Fraud (18 U.S.C. 1030(a)) 
• Criminal copyright infringement (17 U.S.C. § 506 and 18 U.S.C. § 2319) 
 
ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE (18 U.S.C. § 1831) 
Section 1831 of the EEA is targeted at economic espionage conducted by or on behalf of 
foreign governments or instrumentalities. In addition to the three general elements of an 
espionage case — that (1) the defendant stole or, with or without the authorization of the 
owner, obtained, destroyed, or conveyed information; (2) the defendant knew the 
information was proprietary; and (3) the information was in fact a trade secret) — there is a 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.323 
fourth element that the government must prove to successfully prosecute under section 
1831. The government must show that the defendant intended or knew that the offense 
would benefit a foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent. Attempts and 
conspiracies to commit these offenses are also punishable under section 1831.  
 
The maximum punishment under section 1831 is 15 years imprisonment and a fine of 
$500,000. If the offense is committed by an organization, the maximum fine is $10 million.  
 
THEFT OF TRADE SECRETS (18 U.S.C. § 1832) 
Section 1832 is concerned with conventional commercial theft and misappropriation of trade 
secrets. It principally covers domestic crimes. In addition to three standard elements of 
espionage, which were discussed above, a section 1832 action requires the government to 
prove the following three additional elements:  
• That the accused intended to convert the trade secret to the economic benefit of 
someone other than the rightful owner;  
• That the accused intended to injure the owner of the trade secret; and 
• That the trade secret was related to or included in a product that is produced for or 
placed in interstate or foreign commerce.  
 
As evidenced by the additional elements, the requirements for prosecution under section 
1832 are somewhat stricter than under section 1831. For example, section 1832 requires that 
the defendant have intended for someone to gain by the misappropriation, whereas section 
1831 prosecutions can succeed even when the benefits of a theft are noneconomic.  
 
The maximum punishments for an offense under section 1832 are 10 years imprisonment, a 
fine, or both. If the offense is committed by an organization, the fine can run as high as 
$5,000,000. Attempts and conspiracies to commit the domestic theft of trade secrets are also 
punishable under section 1832. 
   
ORDERS TO PRESERVE CONFIDENTIALITY (18 U.S.C. § 1835) 
Trade secret theft victims often feel conflicted about whether to report these crimes to the 
government. They want punishment but fear that their trade secrets will be disclosed during 
the trial process.  
 
Congress addressed this dilemma in section 1835, which gives the government procedures to 
preserve the confidentiality of trade secrets throughout the trial. Section 1835 authorizes the 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.324  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
court to enter orders and take actions “necessary and appropriate to preserve the 
confidentiality of trade secrets.” In addition, section 1835 gives the government the right to 
an interlocutory appeal from an order authorizing a trade secret’s disclosure. 
 
CONSTRUCTION WITH OTHER LAWS (18 U.S.C. § 1838) 
Section 1838 states that “[t]his chapter shall not be construed to preempt or displace any 
other remedies, whether civil or criminal, provided by United States Federal, State... or to 
affect the otherwise lawful disclosure of information by any government employees under 
section 552 of title 5 (commonly known as the Freedom of Information Act).” Therefore, 
the EEA does not bar the government from seeking any other remedies, whether civil or 
criminal.  
 
Disclosing Government Trade Secrets (18 U.S.C. § 1905) 
Section 1905 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code makes it a crime for a federal employee to disclose 
confidential government information, including trade secrets.  
 
Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property (ITSP) (18 U.S.C. § 2314) 
As noted above, the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property (ITSP) statute prohibits 
the transportation, transmittal, or transfer of fraudulently received goods, wares, 
merchandise, securities, or money in interstate or foreign commerce, when valued at $5,000 
or more. Prosecutors may use the ITSP to prosecute theft of commercial trade secrets, 
proprietary information, or other types of intellectual property in certain situations. 
Generally, if the stolen items in question qualify as goods, wares, or merchandise, the courts 
agree that section 2314 applies when a defendant steals a tangible object that contains 
intellectual property. 
 
Mail or Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343) 
Theft of a trade secret may also be prosecuted as mail or wire fraud. As stated earlier, the 
mail and wire fraud laws prohibit the use of the mail or wires in furtherance of a fraudulent 
scheme designed to obtain money or property, which often cover the misappropriation of 
confidential and proprietary information. 
 
Computer Fraud (18 U.S.C. 1030(a)) 
Prosecutors may also consider bring computer fraud charges in addition to or in lieu of EEA 
charges. As previously discussed, section 1030 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, commonly 
known as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, provides criminal sanctions and a civil action 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.325 
for misappropriation of trade secrets stored on protected computers (i.e., computers used 
by, or whose use affects, a financial institution or the U.S. government, or used for interstate 
or foreign commerce). 
 
Section 1030(a) includes seven types of criminal activity; however, only two sections of the 
Act are particularly relevant to trade secrets. Section 1030(a)(2) makes it illegal to access or 
attempt to access a protected computer to obtain information. Section 1030(a)(4) makes it 
illegal to access or attempt to access a protected computer to commit fraud.  
 
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act provides both criminal and civil liability. Criminal acts 
charged under the Act are punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a fine, or both. The Act 
also provides that any person who suffers “d amage or loss” under the Act may maintain a 
civil action against the violator to obtain compensatory damages and injunctive relief or 
other equitable relief. 
 
The Uniform Trade Secrets Act 
The Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) was promulgated by the National Conference of 
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1979. The UTSA is not a federal law, but several 
states have adopted versions of it in an effort to protect trade secrets. The UTSA protects 
against the theft of “formulas, patterns, compilations, programs, devices, methods, 
techniques, and processes” of information.  
 
Companies attempting to show that a competitor has misappropriated a trade secret under 
the UTSA must satisfy a two-pronged test:  
• It must be demonstrated that the company owned a “trade secret.” 
• The company must prove that the defendant used the trade secret in breach of “an 
agreement, a confidential relationship or duty, or as a result of discovery by improper 
means.” 
 
For information to qualify as a trade secret under the UTSA, the owner of the information 
must show that:  
• The information derived independent economic value from its secrecy. 
• Efforts must have been taken to keep the information secret. The UTSA does not 
require the trade secret to have been used in business. 
 
The information does not have to derive actual independent value from its secrecy; it is 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.326  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
enough if there is potential economic value because of the information being kept secret. 
Thus, for plans or innovations that have not yet been put into effect by a company, the 
UTSA would still provide protection. The second prong of the definition once again 
mandates that organizations take reasonable steps to guard their secrets. If information is 
not treated as a secret by its owner, the organization cannot later seek protection under the UTSA.  
 
The UTSA defines a misappropriation of a trade secret as either:  
• The acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to 
know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means 
• Disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a 
person who used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret or at the time 
of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that it was a protected trade secret 
 
The term improper means includes such things as theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach of a 
duty to maintain secrecy, or espionage through electronic or other means. Note that the 
UTSA not only proscribes the stealing of a trade secret, but also the use of that trade secret 
by those who know it was stolen, whether they participated in the theft or not.  
 
Because the UTSA is not a federal law, it has fallen prey to certain difficulties. First, the fact 
that the UTSA was adopted in different versions by different states creates inconsistencies in 
the interpretation of its provisions. Second, the UTSA is not a criminal statute. The lack of 
criminal sanctions for violations of the UTSA takes some of the teeth out of its attempts to 
deter the theft of trade secrets. These are problems that Congress sought to rectify with the 
passage of the Economic Espionage Act. 
 
Money Laundering 
There are several federal statutes that apply to money laundering.  
 
The Bank Secrecy Act 
The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which went into effect in 1970, was the first major piece of 
legislation aimed at detecting and preventing money laundering. Congress enacted the BSA 
to monitor financial transactions, and the Act sets forth a system of reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements designed to help track large or unusual financial transactions. 
 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.327 
The BSA, which is enforced by the Treasury Department, consists of two titles. Title I 
contains provisions requiring that financial institutions and securities brokers and dealers 
keep extensive records of the transactions and accounts of their customers. It is codified in 
Title 12 of the United States Code (U.S.C.), sections 1829b and 1951–1959. The penalties for 
failure to comply with these recordkeeping requirements are severe. Any insured depository 
institution and any director, officer, or employee who willfully or through gross negligence 
violates any regulation can be subject to a $10,000 civil penalty. The statute further provides 
that a separate violation occurs for each day the violation continues and at each office, branch, 
or place of business at which the violation occurs. If a violation is committed in furtherance 
of a felony crime, criminal penalties can be imposed of up to five years in prison and/or a 
fine of not more than $10,000. 
 
Title II of the BSA (originally entitled Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act) 
requires banks, “financial institutions” (which in clude casinos, securities brokers and dealers, 
currency exchanges, and others), and, in some cases, individuals to report to the government 
certain transactions. Title II is codified at 31, U.S.C., §§ 5311–5333. Title II sets forth civil 
and criminal penalties for noncompliance.  
 
Title 18, U.S.C. §§ 1956–57 Money Laundering Statutes 
In addition to the BSA, Congress enacted sections 1956 and 1957 of Title 18, which emanate 
from the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, to combat money laundering. These complex 
statutes forbid money laundering  in connection criminal activity, including but not limited to 
narcotics trafficking.  
 
LAUNDERING OF MONETARY INSTRUMENTS (18 U.S.C. § 1956) 
Section 1956 addresses financial transactions involving proceeds of criminal activity. It 
covers three types of money laundering, which are found in sections 1956(a)(1), 1956(a)(2), 
and 1956(a)(3).  
 
Section 1956(a)(1) concerns domestic money laundering. To establish an offense under 
section 1956(a)(1), the government must establish that “(1) the defendant took part in a 
financial transaction; (2) the defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction 
involved the proceeds of illegal activity; (3) that the property involved was in fact the 
proceeds of that illegal activity; and (4) the defendant knew that the transaction was designed 
in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, source, location, ownership, or control 
of the illegal proceeds.” U.S. v. Ruiz-Castro, 92 F.3d 1519 (10th Cir. 1996). 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.328  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Individuals who violate Section 1956(a)(1) may be fined up to $500,000 or twice the value of 
the monetary instrument or funds (whichever is greater) and imprisoned for up to 20 years. 
Also, assets acquired because of violations of this provision are subject to forfeiture by the 
government. 
 
Section 1956(a)(2) pertains to international money laundering. Section 1956(a)(2) prohibits 
the transportation, transmission, or transfer of funds either into or out of the United States 
if the person knows the funds are the proceeds of unlawful activity and the transportation, 
transmission, or transfer is done with the intent to promote the carrying on of “specified 
unlawful conduct”; is done to conceal the natu re, location, source, ownership, or control of 
the funds; or is done to avoid reporting requirements. The penalties are the same as those set 
forth in section 1956(a)(1).  
 
Section 1956(a)(3) prohibits a person from engaging in financial transactions involving 
property the person believes to be the proceeds of illegal activity. This is intended to cover 
sting operations in which a suspect engages in money laundering activity with funds he 
believes to be illegally derived, even though the funds are actually supplied by government 
agents. A person who violates this provision can be imprisoned for up to 20 years and/or 
fined in accordance with 18, U.S.C., § 3571. 
 
Property qualifies as the proceeds of illegal activity if it is derived from a “specified unlawful 
activity,” which includes narcotics-related transactions, transactions related to bankruptcy 
fraud, bribery, false statements, embezzlement, mail or wire fraud, bank fraud, 
environmental violations, health care offenses, and a number of other crimes.  
 
Additionally, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 added terrorism activities, bribery of public 
officials, smuggling, and export control violations to the list of unlawful activities that give 
rise to violations of this law.  
 
On May 21, 2009, President Obama signed into law the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery 
Act of 2009 (FERA). Congress designed FERA to providing federal authorities additional 
tools and resources to prosecute fraudulent financial practices. Among other measures, the 
legislation amends section 1956(c) to broaden the term proceeds to include the gross receipts 
of unlawful activity, rather than merely its profits. This amendment addresses a recent 
Supreme Court ruling that proceeds of criminal activity, as treated by federal money 
laundering statutes, included only the defendant’s profits of such activity. 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.329 
ENGAGING IN MONETARY TRANSACTIONS IN PROPERTY DERIVED FROM SPECIFIED UNLAWFUL ACTIVITY (18 U.S.C. § 1957) 
Section 1957 makes it illegal for any person to knowingly engage or attempt to engage in a 
monetary transaction with criminally derived property greater than $10,000 and is derived 
from “specified unlawful activity.” Section 1957 applies in situations where the offense takes 
place in the United States (or within its special maritime or territorial jurisdiction) or the 
offense takes place outside the United States, and the defendant is a U.S. citizen or legal 
alien. Violations of this statute are punished by fines, up to 10 years of imprisonment, and 
forfeiture of illegally obtained gains. 
 
USA PATRIOT Act 
Congress extended the reach of the BSA and the money laundering statutes when it enacted 
the USA PATRIOT Act in 2001. The Act was en acted in response to the tragedies of 
September 11, 2001, and reflected Congressional concern with the money laundering 
activities of the terrorists who committed those attacks.   
 
Conspiracy 
Criminal conspiracy punishes an agreement between two or more people to commit an 
illegal act. The crime of conspiracy is actually a separate criminal offense, meaning that the 
underlying crime (e.g., bank fraud, bribery, securities fraud, etc.) and the conspiracy to 
commit the underlying crime are two separate offenses. The U.S. Code contains numerous 
specific conspiracy statutes throughout its text, and this section examines some of the most 
relevant conspiracy statutes.  
 
Conspiracy to Defraud the United States (18 U.S.C. § 371) 
Although numerous federal statutes make conspiracy a crime, the most commonly used 
federal conspiracy statute is the general conspiracy statute under section 371 of Title 18, U.S. 
Code. This statute renders it illegal to agree with another person, or to take joint action, to 
defraud the government. Section 371 provides: 
 
If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to 
defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or 
more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under 
this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. 
 
If, however, the offense, the commission of which is the object of the conspiracy, is a misdemeanor 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.330  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
only, the punishment for such conspiracy shall not exceed the maximum punishment provided 
for such misdemeanor. 
 
The essential elements of this statute are: 
• Agreement to defraud 
• The defendant knew the purpose of the agreement and intentionally joined in the 
agreement 
• That at least one of the conspirators knowingly committed at least one overt act in 
furtherance of the conspiracy 
 
Under the first element, the government must prove that the defendant reached an 
agreement or understanding with at least one other person. The conspirators must agree 
about the precise fraud involved. An agreement to defraud the government, without further 
qualification about the nature of the fraud, is not sufficient to support a conviction under 
this statute.  
 
The government must also establish that the defendant knew of the conspiracy’s existence 
and its objective. The government, however, does not have to establish that the defendant 
knew all the details or objectives of the conspiracy, and they do not have to prove that the 
defendant knew the identity of all the participants in the conspiracy.  
 
Finally, the purpose of the conspiracy need not be accomplished for a violation to occur, but 
at least one of the co-conspirators must have carried out at least one overt act in furtherance 
of the conspiracy. The overt act need not be criminal and could be as innocuous as making a 
phone call or writing a letter. 
 
Conspiracy counts are favored by prosecutors because they provide evidentiary and pleading 
advantages. If a conspiracy is shown, the acts and statements of one co-conspirator may be 
admitted into evidence against all, and each co-conspirator may be convicted for the 
underlying substantive offense (e.g., destroying government property) committed by any one 
of its members.  
 
A corporation cannot conspire with one of its own employees to commit an offense because 
the employee and employer are legally viewed as one. A corporation, however, can conspire 
with other business entities or third parties to violate the statute. 
 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.331 
The Sherman Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) 
The Sherman Antitrust Act is designed to combat anticompetitive practices that harm the 
public by undermining economic growth. Specifically, the Act prohibits competitors from 
entering into any agreement to restrain trade in interstate commerce, including price fixing, 
bid rigging, and bid rotation schemes. 
 
Under the Sherman Antitrust Act, every contract, combination in the form of trust or 
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, or with 
foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage 
in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a 
felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $10 million if a 
corporation, or if any other person, $350,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, 
or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court. However, these maximum 
Sherman Act penalties were increased in June 2004. For offenses committed on or after June 
22, 2004, the maximum corporate fine is $100 million, the maximum individual fine is $1 
million, and the maximum jail term is 10 years. 
 
The elements of a criminal antitrust violation include: 
• An agreement or combination 
• Of two or more entities 
• That unduly restrains trade 
• In interstate or foreign commerce 
 
Attempt and Conspiracy to Commit Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1349) 
As previously noted, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act added a statute that allows prosecutions of 
attempts and conspiracies under the fraud statutes in Title 18. This applies to mail fraud, 
wire fraud, securities fraud, bank fraud, and health care fraud. 
 
Conspiracy to Defraud Federal Government with False Claims (18 U.S.C. § 286) 
Section 286 of Title 18, U.S. Code, makes it a crime for two or more persons to agree or 
conspire to defraud the United States by obtaining or aiding in obtaining payment or 
allowance of any false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim. Any person found guilty under this 
section may be fined, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both. 
 
Under section 286, the government must prove: 
• The defendant entered into an agreement to defraud the United States by obtaining or 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.332  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
aiding in obtaining payment or allowance of any false, fictitious or fraudulent claim 
• The defendant knew or was deliberately ignorant of the claim’s falsity, fictitiousness, or 
fraudulence 
• The defendant knew of the conspiracy, intended to join, and voluntarily participated in 
the conspiracy 
 
RICO Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 1962(d)) 
Section 1962(d) prohibits conspiring to violate any criminal provisions under the Racketeer 
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Unlike the general conspiracy statute, a 
conspiracy under section 1962(d) does not require some overt act on the defendant’s part.  
 
Aiding and Abetting (18 U.S.C. § 2) 
The federal aiding and abetting statute provides that anyone who induces another to commit 
an offense or who aids in its commission may himself be charged and convicted of the 
underlying offense and subject to its penalties.  
 
Obstruction of Justice 
The obstruction of justice statutes punish efforts to impede or obstruct the investigation or 
trial of other substantive offenses. Prosecutors usually are pleased to discover such violations 
because they add a more sinister flavor to what might be colorless white-collar charges and 
help to prove underlying criminal intent. In many instances, these charges draw the stiffest 
penalties. 
 
There are several obstruction statutes in the federal code, including 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503 
(influencing or injuring officer or juror generally), 1504 (influencing a juror through a 
writing), 1506 (theft or alteration of a record or process), 1509 (obstruction relating to court 
orders), 1512 (tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant), 1516 (obstruction of a 
federal audit), and 1517 (obstructing the examination of a financial institution).  
 
In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 set forth increasingly important obstruction of 
justice provisions concerning fraud examinations. The Act amended section 1512 to include 
document destruction by the accused and instituted two of the most significant criminal 
statutes addressing obstruction of justice: 18 U.S.C. § 1519 and 18 U.S.C. § 1520.  
 
An examination of every obstruction statute, however, is beyond the scope of this text. 
Therefore, this section focuses on the obstruction statutes most relevant to fraud 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.333 
examinations, including section 1516, section 1517, and those enacted or amended by the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  
 
Obstruction of Federal Audit (18 U.S.C. § 1516) 
This statute, originally passed in 1988, makes it a felony for anyone to influence, obstruct, or 
impede a federal auditor in the performance of his official duties. Although the “influence, 
obstruct, or impeded” language employed by the statute is broad, the government rarely 
employs this statute.  
 
Obstructing Examination of Financial Institution (18 U.S.C. § 1517) 
A similar statute, passed in 1990, makes it a felony to obstruct the examination of a financial 
institution. The statute provides: 
 
Whoever corruptly obstructs or attempts to obst ruct any examination of a financial institution 
by an agency of the United States with jurisdiction to conduct an examination of such financial 
institution shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both. 
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION BY THE ACCUSED (18 U.S.C. § 1512(C)) 
Sarbanes-Oxley amended section 1512 of the U.S. Code to make it a criminal offense to 
corruptly alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal a record or document with the intent to impair 
its integrity or use in an official proceeding, or to otherwise obstruct, influence, or impede 
any official proceeding or attempt to do so. Until Congress amended section 1512, it was 
more narrowly focused on witness tampering. Violations of this section are punishable by 
fines up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to 20 years. 
 
DESTRUCTION, ALTERATION, OR FALSIFICATION OF RECORDS IN FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS AND BANKRUPTCY (18 U.S.C. § 1519) 
Following the Enron scandal, section 1519 of Title 18, U.S. Code, was added to narrow the 
scope of when destruction under a document retention policy must cease. Unlike section 
1512(c), which uses the word corruptly, section 1519 uses the word knowingly.  
 
DESTRUCTION OF CORPORATE AUDIT RECORDS (18 U.S.C. § 1520) 
Section 802 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act added a statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1520, to govern the 
destruction of corporate audit records. Section 1520 makes it a crime for accountants to 
knowingly and willfully fail to maintain certain audit records and work papers for five years 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.334  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
from the end of the fiscal period in which the audit was concluded. In addition to providing 
for prosecution of those who obstruct justice, the statute is designed to ensure that 
important financial evidence is maintained so that government officials, regulators, and 
victims can determine whether a violation occurred.    
 
Perjury 
Perjury (18 U.S.C. §§ 1621 and 1623)  is an intentional false statement given under oath on a 
material point. Under a related federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1623, the government may allege 
and prove perjury if the defendant makes two irreconcilable contradictory statements 
without proving which is true and which is false. False and fraudulent statements — orally or 
in writing — made to a government agency on a material matter also may be punished as a 
felony under a variety of statutes even if not given under oath. 
 
 
Fines Under Title 18 
Several sections of Title 18 do not provide a specified maximum fine in the section setting 
forth the offense. Instead, these criminal statutes usually provide that the offender may “be 
fined under this title.” Unless a section sets fo rth another amount, the sections below should 
be used to determine the maximum sentence available. 
 
Sentence of Fine (18 U.S.C. § 3571) 
In general, the statutory provisions governing a sentence of a fine are set forth in section 
3571. It specifies the maximum fines that courts can impose against individuals and 
organizations. Section 3571 provides: 
 
(a) In general. — A defendant who has been found guilty of an offense may be sentenced to pay a 
fine. 
 
(b) Fines for individuals. — Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, an individual 
who has been found guilty of an offense may be fined not more than the greatest of — 
(1) The amount specified in the law setting forth the offense; 
(2) The applicable amount under subsection (d) of this section; 
 (3) For a felony, not more than $250,000; 
 (4) For a misdemeanor resulting in  death, not more than $250,000; 
 (5) For a Class A misdemeanor that does not result in death, not more than $100,000; 
(6) For a Class B or C misdemeanor that does not result in death, not more than $5,000; 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.335 
or 
(7) For an infraction, not more than $5,000. 
 
(c) Fines for organizations. — Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, an 
organization that has been found guilty of an offense may be fined not more than the 
greatest of — 
(1) The amount specified in the law setting forth the offense; 
(2) The applicable amount under subsection (d) of this section; 
(3) For a felony, not more than $500,000; 
(4) For a misdemeanor resulting in death, not more than $500,000; 
(5) For a Class A misdemeanor that does not result in death, not more than $200,000; 
(6) For a Class B or C misdemeanor that does not result in death, not more than 
$10,000; and 
(7) For an infraction, not more than $10,000. 
 
(d) Alternative fine based on gain or loss. — If any person derives pecuniary gain from the 
offense, or if the offense results in pecuniary loss to a person other than the defendant, the 
defendant may be fined not more than the greater of twice the gross gain or twice the gross 
loss, unless imposition of a fine under this subsection would unduly complicate or prolong 
the sentencing process. 
 
(e) Special rule for lower fine specified in substantive provis ion. — If a law setting forth an 
offense specifies no fine or a fine that is lower than the fine otherwise applicable under this 
section and such law, by specific reference, exempts the offense from the applicability of the 
fine otherwise applicable under this section, the defendant may not be fined more than the 
amount specified in the law setting forth the offense. 
 
Imposition of a Sentence of Fine and Related Matters (18 U.S.C. § 3572) 
Section 3572 sets forth the factors courts should consider in imposing fines. It provides: 
 
(a) Factors to be considered. — In determining whether to impose a fine, and the amount, time 
for payment, and method of payment of a fine, the court shall consider, in addition to the 
factors set forth in section 3553(a) — 
(1)  The defendant's income, earning capacity, and financial resources; 
(2)  The burden that the fine will impose upon the defendant, any person who is financially 
dependent on the defendant, or any other person (including a government) that would 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.336  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
be responsible for the welfare of any person financially dependent on the defendant, 
relative to the burden that alternative punishments would impose; 
(3)  Any pecuniary loss inflicted upon others as a result of the offense; 
(4)  Whether restitution is ordered or made and the amount of such restitution; 
(5)  The need to deprive the defendant of illegally obtained gains from the offense; 
(6) The expected costs to the government of any imprisonment, supervised release, or 
probation component of the sentence; 
(7) Whether the defendant can pass on to consumers or other persons the expense of the 
fine; and 
(8) If the defendant is an organization, the size of the organization and any measure taken 
by the organization to discipline any officer, director, employee, or agent of the 
organization responsible for the offense and to prevent a recurrence of such an offense. 
 
(b) Fine not to impair ability to make restitution. — If, as a result of a conviction, the defendant 
has the obligation to make restitution to a victim of the offense, the court shall impose a fine 
or other monetary penalty only to the extent that such fine or penalty will not impair the 
ability of the defendant to make restitution. 
 
(c)   Effect of finality of judgment. Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence to pay a fine can 
subsequently be — 
(1) Modified or remitted under section 3573; 
(2) Corrected under rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and section 3742; 
or 
(3) Appealed and modified under section 3742; 
a judgment that includes such a sentence is a final judgment for all other purposes 
 
(d)   Time, method of payment, and related items 
(1) A person sentenced to pay a fine or other monetary penalty, including restitution, shall 
make such payment immediately, unless, in the interest of justice, the court provides for 
payment on a date certain or in installments. If the court provides for payment in 
installments, the installments shall be in equal monthly payments over the period 
provided by the court, unless the court establishes another schedule. 
(2) If the judgment, or, in the case of a restitution order, the order, permits other than 
immediate payment, the length of time over which scheduled payments will be made 
shall be set by the court, but shall be the shortest time in which full payment can 
reasonably be made. 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.337 
(3) A judgment for a fine which permits payments in installments shall include a 
requirement that the defendant will notify the court of any material change in the 
defendant's economic circumstances that might affect the defendant’s ability to pay the 
fine. Upon receipt of such notice the court may, on its own motion or the motion of any 
party, adjust the payment schedule, or require immediate payment in full, as the 
interests of justice require. 
 
(e)   Alternative sentence precluded. At the time a defendant is sentenced to pay a fine, the court 
may not impose an alternative sentence to be carried out if the fine is not paid. 
(f)   Responsibility for payment of monetary obligation relating to organization. If a sentence 
includes a fine, special assessment, restitution or other monetary obligation (including 
interest) with respect to an organization, each individual authorized to make disbursements 
for the organization has a duty to pay the obligation from assets of the organization. If such 
an obligation is imposed on a director, officer, shareholder, employee, or agent of an 
organization, payments may not be made, di rectly or indirectly, from assets of the 
organization, unless the court finds that such payment is expressly permissible under 
applicable State law. 
 
(g)   Security for stayed fine. If a sentence imposing a fine is stayed, the court shall, absent 
exceptional circumstances (as determined by the court) - 
(1) Require the defendant to deposit, in the registry of the district court, any amount of the 
fine that is due; 
(2) Require the defendant to provide a bond or other security to ensure payment of the fine; 
or 
(3) Restrain the defendant from transferring or dissipating assets. 
 
 (h)  Delinquency. A fine or payment of restitut ion is delinquent if a payment is more than 30 
days late. 
 
(i)   Default. A fine or payment of restitution is in default if a payment is delinquent for more 
than 90 days. Notwithstanding any installment schedule, when a fine or payment of 
restitution is in default, the entire amount of the fine or restitution is due within 30 days 
after notification of the default, subject to the provisions of section 3613A.

restitution on the federal level. It requires federal courts to order restitution for each 
defendant, without consideration of the defendant’s economic circumstances, who has been 
convicted or plead guilty to charges for certain categories of offenses, including fraud under 
Title 18, U.S. Code. Thus, victim corporations may be entitled to victim compensation, just 
like natural persons.  
 
Recently, courts have held that the MVRA third parties have the right to recover not only 
the losses suffered as a result of the wrongdoing, but also the costs associated with 
investigating the offense. Specifically, the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit agree that 
section 3663A(b)(4) of the MVRA provides for restitution of attorneys’ fees and certain out-of-pocket 
investigative expenses a victim company incurs as part of an internal investigation 
of suspected fraud. 
 
 
Qui Tam Suits and the Civil False Claims Act 
A qui tam suit is one in which a private individual sues on behalf of the government to 
recover damages for criminal or fraudulent actions committed against the government. It is a 
civil not a criminal suit. Most qui tam actions are brought under the False Claims Act, 31 
U.S.C. § 3729 et seq. This statute provides, in part, that anyone who commits the following 
acts is liable to the government for three times the amount of damages it sustains, plus a civil 
penalty of $5,000 to $10,000 per false claim: 
• Knowingly presents or causes to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or 
approval (§ 3729(a)(1)) 
• Knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to get 
a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved (§ 3729(a)(2)) 
• Conspires to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or 
paid (§ 3729(a)(3)) 
• Making or delivering a document certifying receipt of property to be used by the 
government without completely knowing that the information on the receipt is true (§ 
3729(a)(5)) 
• Knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made  or used, a false record or statement to 
conceal, avoid, or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the 
government (§ 3729(a)(7)) 
 
  
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.339 
Most qui tam actions seek to recover damages and statutory penalties for false claims made 
to the government by government contractors such as defense contractors and health care 
providers. 
 
Since 1986, when Congress substantially strengthened the civil False Claims Act, the United 
States has secured more than $24 billion in settlements and judgments ($2.4 billion in the 
2009 fiscal year alone). 
 
Filing an Action 
If an individual has knowledge that a false claim was submitted to the government, the 
individual should first retain an attorney. The attorney will then draft a complaint and a 
disclosure statement. The whistleblower can file the complaint and the disclosure statement 
under seal in U.S. District Court and copies are served upon the Department of Justice. 
After the filing of the complaint, the Justice Department has 60 days to investigate the 
allegations and determine whether it will join the lawsuit. If the department decides not to 
participate in the lawsuit, the individual has the right to continue to pursue the claim on 
behalf of the United States. If the department does not participate, the whistleblower will 
receive a higher portion of any recovery received. 
 
If the Justice Department elects to join the lawsuit, it has the primary responsibility for 
prosecuting the case and can limit the whistleblower’s participation in the action. If the 
government successfully prosecutes the suit, the private party may recover from 15–25 
percent of the recovery, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. If the government does 
not take over the prosecution, and the qui tam plaintiff successfully wins the case on his 
own, the court may award the plaintiff 25–30 percent of the recovery, plus reasonable 
attorneys’ fees and costs.  The judge normally determines the percentage. 
 
Who Can Bring a Qui Tam Action 
The False Claims Act provides that any “person” can file a qui tam action as long as they 
have direct and independent knowledge of the fraud and such knowledge was not obtained 
from a “public disclosure.” The definition of person includes not only individuals, but also 
businesses and state or local government entities. The most common plaintiffs in qui tam 
actions are employees of government contractors, health care employees, and employees of 
local, state, or federal government. 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed this definition in an opinion handed down May 22, 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.340  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
2000. In the case of Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. U.S. ex rel. Stevens, 120 S.Ct. 1858, 
the court resolved a conflict among some of the courts of appeal by stating firmly that 
private citizens do have the right to sue under the False Claims Act. However, the Court also 
held that states and state agencies are not subject to liability under the False Claims Act. 
Therefore, if a state or state agency submits false claims to the federal government, they 
cannot be sued by a private individual under the provisions of the False Claims Act. The 
Court did not address the issue of whether the U.S. government could file suit against a state 
under the FCA. 
 
The requirement that a person’s knowledge of the fraud was not obtained from a public 
disclosure does, however, have one exception. Even if based on public disclosure, a qui tam 
suit may proceed if the plaintiff is “an original  source of the information,” which requires the 
plaintiff to have “direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the 
allegations are based” and have “voluntarily provided the information to the government 
before filing [a suit] which is  based on the information.”  
 
At the present time, a controversy still exists over whether federal employees can file qui tam 
actions under the False Claims Act when knowledge of the fraud was obtained through their 
official duties. At least two federal circuit courts that have addressed the issue have 
concluded that employees who are required and paid by the government to disclose fraud 
cannot bring qui tam actions since their knowledge of fraud was not obtained independently. 
In contrast, two federal circuits have held that federal employees may bring a qui tam suit, 
even if the action is based on information obtained during the course of their employment. 
Thus, federal employees may be prohibited from filing qui tam actions, particularly if 
detecting fraud is part of their job duties. 
 
Protections for Whistleblowers 
Many whistleblowers are employees of the government contractor on which they are 
blowing the whistle. Obviously, employees might be reluctant to report their employer to the 
government for fear of retaliation. To address this concern, Congress provided substantial 
protections to whistleblowers. Title 31 U.S.C. section 3730(h) prohibits an employer from 
taking any adverse action (including discharge, demotion, or harassment) against an 
employee “because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others 
in furtherance of an action under this section, including the investigation or initiation of, 
testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section.” 
 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.341 
If an employer takes adverse action against the employee, the employee can seek relief 
against the employer including reinstatement at the same seniority status, an award of two 
times the employee’s back pay plus interest, and any other special damages required to make 
the employee whole. The employee also can receive reimbursement for all the costs of the 
litigation, including attorneys’ fees. 
 
Although these provisions provide necessary and justifiable protection for employees, in 
some cases they have the unintended effect of preventing an employer from firing or taking 
any other action against a whistleblower, even if there is adequate cause. Employers often are 
unwilling to implement any negative employment decision (no matter how justifiable) against 
a whistleblower for fear that the employee will add a claim of retaliation to the suit. 
The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act (FERA), which was signed into law on May 20, 
2009, enhanced the whistleblower protections under the False Claims Act by making these 
retaliation claims available to government contractors and agents. 
 
 
Federal “Whistleblower” Statutes 
There are numerous federal laws protecting whistleblowers or employees from retaliation or 
illegal treatment. This section organizes those whistleblower protection laws, which are more 
applicable to CFEs, under specific industries and various areas of law. Even though every 
state has some form of anti-retaliation legislation protecting whistleblowers, this discussion 
will primarily focus on federal law. Therefore, before taking action under any 
whistleblower/anti-retaliation law, a fraud examiner is always well advised to consult an 
attorney for the law of a specific jurisdiction. 
 
In focusing on federal whistleblower/anti-retaliation laws that are more applicable to CFEs, 
this discussion excludes protection laws concerning asbestos, aviation, environmental and 
nuclear laws, federal grants, maritime law, migrant workers, mining, pipeline safety, railroads, 
and transportation and shipping. In addition, this section organizes the applicable laws under 
the following headings:  
• The Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
• The Whistleblower Protection Act 
• Banking and Financial Institutions 
• Civil Rights Act of 1871 
• Federal Government Contracting  
• Employees and Members of the Armed Forces 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.342  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
Although the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, passed in 2002, is primarily an accounting reform statute, 
most people do not realize that it made some extremely significant changes to the 
whistleblower laws.  
 
Civil Liability for Reports of Securities Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1514A) 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 806 creates 18 U.S.C. § 1514A, a statute that creates civil liability for 
companies that retaliate against whistleblowers. It should be noted that this provision does 
not provide universal whistleblower protection; it only protects employees of publicly traded  
companies. Section 1514A makes it unlawful to fire, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in 
any other manner discriminate against an employee for providing information or aiding in an 
investigation of securities fraud. However, the statute requires that the employee must report 
the suspected misconduct to a federal regulatory or law enforcement agency, a member of 
Congress or a committee of Congress, or a supervisor. Employees are also protected against 
retaliation for filing, testifying in, participating in, or otherwise assisting in a proceeding filed 
or about to be filed relating to an alleged violation of securities laws or SEC rules. 
 
The whistleblower protections apply even if the company is ultimately found not to have 
committed securities fraud. As long as the employee reasonably believes he is reporting 
conduct that constitutes a violation of various federal securities laws, then he is protected. 
The protections not only cover retaliatory acts by the company, but also by any officer, 
employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of the company.  
 
To assert a section 806 retaliation claim, an employee must file a complaint with either the 
secretary of labor or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) area 
director within 90 days of the alleged retaliatory action, which generally occurs when the 
complainant receives notice of the adverse action. The Act further provides that if a final 
decision has not been issued within 180 days of the complaint filing and there is no showing 
that the delay is due to the claimant’s bad faith, the complaining party may bring a private 
claim in an appropriate federal district court.  
 
Whether a complainant’s 806 claim is heard through the administrative channel or by a 
district court, the elements of proof are the same. The complainant must prove by a 
preponderance of the evidence that (1) the employee engaged in a protected activity or 
conduct; (2) the employer knew that the employee engaged in protected activity; (3) the 
employee suffered an unfavorable personal action; and (4) the protected activity was a 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.343 
contributing factor in the unfavorable personal action. However, even if the complainant 
proves each of these elements, the employer may avoid liability by demonstrating by clear 
and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action 
even in the absence of such protected activity. 
 
If a public company is found to have violated section 1514A, the Act provides for an award 
of compensatory damages sufficient to “make the employee whole.” Penalties include 
reinstatement; back pay with interest; and compensation for special damages including 
litigation costs, expert witness fees, and attorneys’ fees.  
 
Criminal Sanctions for Reports to Law Enforcement (18 U.S.C. § 1513) 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 1107 also amended section 1513 of Title 18, U.S. Code, to make it a 
crime to knowingly, with the intent to retaliate, take any harmful action against a person for 
providing truthful information relating to the commission or possible commission of any  
federal offense, not just securities fraud. This protection is only triggered, however, when 
information is provided to a law enforcement officer.  
 
Violations of section 1513 can be punished by fines of up to $250,000 and up to 10 years in 
prison for individuals. Corporations that violate the act can be fined up to $500,000.  
 
The Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 1211–1215, 1218–1219, 1221–1222, 7703) 
Two pieces of U.S. legislation, the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and the Whistleblower 
Protection Act of 1989, define the character of whistleblower protection for federal 
employees. The Civil Service Reform Act protected federal employees who disclosed 
information about the government’s misconduct or waste. In 1989, the Whistleblower 
Protection Act (WPA) strengthened the protections provided in the Civil Reform Act to 
protect federal employees from workplace retaliation when disclosing illegal or improper 
government activities. Specifically, the act prevents a federal agency from taking any adverse 
“personnel action” against a civil servant w ho has reported wrongdoing by the agency.  
 
To receive protection under the WPA, employees must first file a complaint with the U.S. 
Office of Special Counselor (OSC), an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial 
agency that investigates whistleblower complaints. There is no statute of limitations for 
initially filing a complaint with the OSC. In addition, the WPA provides federal employees 
an independent right of action; however, this right is only available if the OSC has closed the 
matter at issue or has not notified the employee within 120 days that it will pursue corrective 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.344  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
action. This right of action, which is filed with the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), 
must be filed within 60 days of an adverse OSC decision. Appeals under the WPA fall under 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s exclusive jurisdiction. Remedies that may 
be awarded to employees under the WPA include reinstatement, back pay, and attorneys’ 
fees. 
 
But it is important to note that there are several circumstances that do not afford employees 
protection under the WPA. For example, the WPA does not protect employees who make 
disclosures during the course of performing their job duties. In addition, employees cannot 
claim protection under the WPA if they make disclosures of wrongdoing directly to the 
wrongdoer, or if they make disclosures of publicly known information. 
 
Banking and Financial Institutions   
In 1989, Congress passed three laws that contained anti-retaliation provisions to protect 
both federal and private sector employees within the banking system. The three primary laws 
covering the banking sector are contained within Title 31 of the U.S. Code, the Federal 
Credit Union Act, and the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act.  
 
Monetary Transactions (31 U.S.C. § 5328) 
Title 31 of the U.S. Code outlines the role of money and finance in the U.S. Code. Section 
5328 contains an anti-retaliation provision, prohibiting financial and nondepository financial 
institutions from discharging or otherwise discriminating against any employees who provide 
information to the secretary of the treasury, the attorney general, or any federal supervisory 
agency about possible violations of Title 31 or its regulations, or of specific anti-money 
laundering laws and transactions by unlicensed money transmitting businesses. To bring a 
claim under section 5328, an individual should file a civil action in federal court within two 
years of the retaliation. If an employee brings a successful claim, courts may grant relief, 
including reinstatement, compensatory damages, and “other appropriate actions to remedy 
any past discrimination.”  
 
Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1790b) 
The Federal Credit Union Act (FCUA) established the federal credit unions system and 
provides for the supervision of federal credit unions. The FCUA contains anti-retaliation 
and anti-discrimination provisions that protect credit union and National Credit Union 
Administration employees who provide information to a government body about possible 
legal violations by credit unions or by the directors, officers, or employees of credit unions. 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.345 
To bring an anti-retaliation claim under the FCUA, an employee should file a civil action in 
federal court within two years of the retaliation. However, when initiating such action, the 
employee must also file a copy of the complaint with the National Credit Union 
Administration Board. If successful, employees are entitled to reinstatement, compensatory 
damages, and “other appropriate actions to remedy any past discrimination.”  
 
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C. § 1831j) 
Following the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, Congress passed the Financial Institutions 
Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) to enhance the safety of savings 
institutions. Among other things, FIRREA provides anti-retaliation protection for 
employees of depository institutions and federal banks. FIRREA protects such employees 
from discharge or discriminatory actions with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment if the employee reports certain conduct (including possible 
violation of any law or regulation, gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of 
authority, or a substantial or specific danger to public health) to a regulatory agency, bank, or 
the attorney general. To file an anti-retaliation claim under FIRREA, an employee should file 
a civil action in federal court within two years of the retaliation. 
 
If successful in bringing an anti-retaliation claim, employees are entitled to reinstatement, 
compensatory damages, and “other appropriate actions to remedy any past discrimination.” 
Courts have also held that in appropriate cases, punitive damages are permitted. 
 
There are also a number of statutes that provide protections to employees who expose 
violations of environmental laws. The provisions of these acts are substantially similar to the 
anti-retaliation provisions under FIRREA. They include the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the 
Water Pollution Control Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Safe Water Drinking 
Act, and the Clean Air Act.  
 
Civil Rights Act of 1871 
Civil rights are rights that the U.S. government has guaranteed and protected. Although the 
Civil Rights Acts refer to several federal statutes that allow individuals whose civil rights 
have been violated to sue their violator(s), this section will examine the anti-retaliation 
protections under section 1983 of Title 42, U.S. Code.  
 
Where state action is involved, a whistleblower may be able to bring a claim under section 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.346  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
1983, which allows individuals to bring a claim against state actors, acting under color of 
state or local law, alleging a depravation of civil rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution or 
federal law. Section 1983 actions may be brought in either federal or state court. States also 
have jurisdiction to hear section 1983 cases. However, if the plaintiff does bring suit in state 
court, the defendant has the right to remove the case to federal court. In a related matter, the 
statute of limitations for claims brought under section 1983 is selected from the law of the 
forum state.  
 
Damages under section 1983 are generally determined according to damages awarded in 
common law tort actions; therefore, the damages that courts may award under section 1983 
include actual or compensatory damages, nominal damages, and punitive damages.  
 
Generally, section 1983 claims brought by public employees concerning whistleblower 
protections allege retaliation in violation of the First Amendment, which provides 
whistleblower protection for public employees that comment on matters of public concern 
that trump an employer’s interest in an efficient workplace. However, in Garcetti v. Ceballos, 
547 U.S. 410 (2006), the Supreme Court limited the extent of First Amendment 
whistleblower protections for government employees, ruling that there is no protection for 
government employees that make disclosures of wrongdoing while in the course of their 
normal job duties. 
 
Federal Government Contracting 
Employees of Defense Contractors (10 U.S.C. § 2409) 
Section 2409 of Title 10, U. S. Code, provides a measure of protection to employees of 
Defense contractors who report violations of laws or regulations relating to defense 
contracts. Under section 2409, an employee of a contractor may not be discharged, demoted, 
or discriminated against for reporting violations of law related to a contract awarded by the 
head of certain federal agencies (i.e., Department of Defense or Department of the Army). A 
person may submit a complaint to the Inspector General (IG) of the contracting agency. If 
an employee does not receive relief through the IG/agency head route, which is generally 
required within 180 days, the employee may bring a claim in federal court. Section 2409 does 
not contain any statute of limitations, and under a successful section 2409 claim, employees 
are entitled to reinstatement, compensatory damages, including back pay, and all costs and 
expenses, including attorneys’ fees, reasonably incurred by the employee in bringing the 
complaint. 
 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.347 
False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–3732) 
To counteract fraudulent billings turned in to the federal government, the False Claims Act 
(FCA) allows private individuals, on behalf of the federal government, to bring claims 
against federal contractors for committing fraud against the government. The FCA contains 
an anti-retaliation provision under Title 31 U.S.C. section 3730(h), which prohibits an 
employer from taking any adverse action (including discharge, demotion, or harassment) 
against an employee “because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the 
employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section, including the investigation 
or initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this 
section.” Federal courts have jurisdiction for section 3730(h) claims, and since section 
3730(h) does not contain any statute of limitations, courts generally borrow the most closely 
analogous state limitations period, which begins tolling when the cause of action accrued. 
 
If an employer takes adverse action against the employee, the employee can seek relief 
against the employer, including reinstatement at the same seniority status, an award of two 
times the employee’s back pay plus interest, and any other special damages required to make 
the employee whole. The employee also can receive reimbursement for all the costs of the 
litigation, including attorneys’ fees. 
 
The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act (FERA), a recently enacted law designed to 
combat fraud, makes significant changes to the False Claims Act. Among other significant 
changes, FERA expanded the anti-retaliation protections under the False Claims Act by 
making these retaliation claims available to government contractors and agents. 
 
Contractor Employees of Civilian Agencies (41 U.S.C. § 265) 
Section 265(a) of Title 41, U.S. Code, provides whistleblower protections for employees of 
civilian contractors with federal agencies by prohibiting government contractors from 
discharging or otherwise retaliating against an employee for reporting employer contract 
violations “to a Member of Congress or an authorized official of an executive agency or the 
Department of Justice.” Section 265(b) provides that such complaints are to be filed with the 
Inspector General of the executive agency or, if the agency does not have an Inspector 
General, to the official designated by the head of the executive agency. However, the statute 
does not include any right to private action for individuals who believe they have been 
aggrieved and, in fact, indicates that no private right exists under the section.  
 
Under this law, an employee who brings a successful claim is entitled to reinstatement and 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2)  Law 
2.348  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
compensatory damages, including back pay. Additionally, section 265 “permits any aggrieved 
party to appeal the agency head’s order to the appropriate United States Court of Appeals 
within 60 days.” 
 
Major Fraud Act (18 U.S.C. § 1031) 
Congress enacted the Major Fraud Act to provide federal prosecutors with an additional 
criminal statute that targeted major procurement fraud committed against the United States. 
The Act contains a whistleblower protection clause in section 1031(h), providing that any 
individual who is discharged, demoted, harassed, or otherwise mistreated by their employer 
as a result of the individual’s cooperation in the prosecution of offenses under the Act may 
obtain reinstatement, two times the amount of back pay due, and other damages, including 
litigation costs and attorneys’ fees. There is no federal statute of limitations expressly 
applicable to a federal cause of action under section 1031(h), and in such instances, courts 
generally apply the most closely analogous statute of limitations under state law. Section 
1031(g)(1) of the Major Fraud Act authorizes the attorney general to pay up to $250,000 in 
certain circumstances for information regarding possible prosecutions under this section.  
 
Employees and Members of the Armed Forces 
Non-Appropriated Fund Employees (10 U.S.C. § 1587) 
Section 1587 of Title 10, U.S. Code, prohibits persons subject to this regulation from taking 
retaliatory action against a civilian employee, paid from non-appropriated funds, of the 
Armed Forces for disclosing information of a violation or “mismanagement, a gross waste of 
funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.”  
 
Employees who believe they were subject to retaliatory action should file their section 1587 
complaint with the inspector general of the Department of Defense (IG DoD), which will 
then determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant an investigation. If 
investigation is warranted, the IG DoD conducts the investigation of reprisal allegations. 
Upon completing the investigation, the IG DoD reports its findings, conclusions, and 
recommendations to the Director of Administration and Management, who is responsible 
for adjudicating reprisal complaints and directing appropriate corrective action.  
 
Military Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (10 U.S.C. § 1034) 
The Military Whistleblower Protection Act, which provides whistleblower protection for 
members of the armed forces, prohibits any individual from retaliating against a service 
member for making or preparing communications concerning illegal conduct to certain 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.349 
statutorily defined recipients. To receive protection under section 1034, service members 
should submit a complaint to the Department of Defense Inspector General or to the 
Department of the Army Inspector General within 60 days of learning of the adverse action. 
A service member who brings a successful claim is entitled to administrative remedy only; 
there is no private right of action under section 1034.  
 
State Statutes 
Every state has some form of legislation protecting whistleblowers. Many are very specific as 
to the manner with which a report must be filed, as well as the particular agencies that must 
receive the report. A particular state also may require that the first report made by an 
employee be directed to the employer under the notion that the employer be given an 
opportunity to correct the circumstances that give rise to a potential violation.
