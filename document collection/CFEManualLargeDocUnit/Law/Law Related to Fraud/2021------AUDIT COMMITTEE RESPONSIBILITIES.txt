AUDIT COMMITTEE RESPONSIBILITIES  
Section 301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act makes the audit committee for each publicly traded 
company “directly responsible” for appointing, compensating, and overseeing the work of 
the company’s outside auditors. The Act also mandates that the auditors must report directly 
to the audit committee — not management — and makes it the responsibility of the audit 
committee to resolve disputes between management and the auditors. Section 301 also 
requires that the audit committee must have the authority and funding to hire independent 
counsel and any other advisors it deems necessary to carry out its duties.
