Bankruptcy Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 151, et seq.) 
Two related but somewhat different types of criminal conduct fall under the general heading 
of bankruptcy fraud. The first is the planned bankruptcy  or bustout  scheme in which the 
wrongdoer sells off for cash, usually below cost, inventory obtained on credit (often through 
false or inflated financial statements) and then absconds with the proceeds. Formal 
bankruptcy proceedings often are not initiated and the crime may be prosecuted under 
general fraud statutes, such as mail or wire fraud.  
 
The second type of bankruptcy offense involves misconduct by a person or entity actually 
involved or contemplating being involved in a formal bankruptcy proceeding. The federal 
criminal laws that regulate bankruptcy proceedings are set out in the Financial Transactions 
section of the Fraud Examiners Manual.
