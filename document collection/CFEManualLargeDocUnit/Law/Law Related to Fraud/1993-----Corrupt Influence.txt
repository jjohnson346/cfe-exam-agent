Corrupt Influence 
To establish a bribery claim, it must be proven that the defendant acted with Proof of corrupt 
influence often involves demonstration that the person receiving the bribe favored the bribe-
 payer in some improper or unusual way, such as by providing preferential treatment, bending 
or breaking the rules, taking extraordinary steps to assist the bribe-payer, or allowing the 
bribe-payer to defraud the agency or company. It is not necessary, however, that the 
prosecution or plaintiff demonstrate that the bribe-taker acted improperly; a bribe might be 
paid to induce an official to perform an act that otherwise would be legal, or an act that the 
official might have performed without a bribe. Bribery schemes involving these 
circumstances, however, are difficult to prove and lack appeal for prosecution.
