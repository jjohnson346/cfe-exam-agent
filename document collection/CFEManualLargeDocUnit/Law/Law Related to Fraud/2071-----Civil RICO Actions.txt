Civil RICO Actions 
The most controversial aspect of RICO is its civil provisions. Under section 1964, civil 
actions may be brought by the government or any private party injured in his business or 
property. Critics complain that private party suits have been used to reach “deep pocket” 
defendants, such as accounting firms, who cannot be characterized as “racketeers”; and to 
coerce unwarranted settlements from blameless defendants fearful of possible treble damage 
judgments. Supporters contend that a plaintiff cannot recover unless there is proof of fraud 
or other criminal acts — whomever the defendant — making the stigma of being alleged a 
racketeer and the award of treble damages justified.
