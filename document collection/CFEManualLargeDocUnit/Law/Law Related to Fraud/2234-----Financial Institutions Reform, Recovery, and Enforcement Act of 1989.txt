Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C. § 1831j) 
Following the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, Congress passed the Financial Institutions 
Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) to enhance the safety of savings 
institutions. Among other things, FIRREA provides anti-retaliation protection for 
employees of depository institutions and federal banks. FIRREA protects such employees 
from discharge or discriminatory actions with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment if the employee reports certain conduct (including possible 
violation of any law or regulation, gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of 
authority, or a substantial or specific danger to public health) to a regulatory agency, bank, or 
the attorney general. To file an anti-retaliation claim under FIRREA, an employee should file 
a civil action in federal court within two years of the retaliation. 
 
If successful in bringing an anti-retaliation claim, employees are entitled to reinstatement, 
compensatory damages, and “other appropriate actions to remedy any past discrimination.” 
Courts have also held that in appropriate cases, punitive damages are permitted. 
 
There are also a number of statutes that provide protections to employees who expose 
violations of environmental laws. The provisions of these acts are substantially similar to the 
anti-retaliation provisions under FIRREA. They include the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the 
Water Pollution Control Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Safe Water Drinking 
Act, and the Clean Air Act.
