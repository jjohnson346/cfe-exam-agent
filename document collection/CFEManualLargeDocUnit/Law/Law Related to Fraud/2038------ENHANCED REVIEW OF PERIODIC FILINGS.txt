ENHANCED REVIEW OF PERIODIC FILINGS 
Sarbanes-Oxley section 408 requires the SEC to make regular and systematic reviews of 
disclosures made by public companies in their periodic reports to the SEC. Reviews of a 
company’s disclosures, including its financial statements, must be made at least once every 
three years. Prior to this enactment, reviews were typically minimal and tended to coincide 
with registered offerings.
