FEDERAL LEGISLATION ADDRESSING MORTGAGE FRAUD 
The following federal statutes are commonly used to prosecute mortgage fraud:

18 U.S.C. § 1014 False statements on a loan or credit application 
18 U.S.C. § 1028 Fraud and related activities in connection with identity theft 
18 U.S.C. § 1029 Credit card fraud 
18 U.S.C. § 1030 Computer fraud 
18 U.S.C. § 1349 Conspiracy 
18 U.S.C. § 1519 Obstruction of justice 
18 U.S.C. § 1956 Money laundering 
18 U.S.C. § 1957 Monetary transactions with illegal proceeds 
18 U.S.C. § 1001 False statements or entries (generally) 
18 U.S.C. § 1005 False entries to federally insured institutions 
18 U.S.C. § 1010 False statements in HUD transactions 
18 U.S.C. § 408 Fraud in connection with Social Security identification documents 
18 U.S.C. § 1961 Criminal RICO 
18 U.S.C. § 215 Receipt of commissions or gifts for procuring loans 
18 U.S.C. § 371 Conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud the United States 
18 U.S.C. § 656 Theft, embezzlement, or  misapplication by a bank officer or 
employee 
18 U.S.C. § 2314 Transportation of stolen goods or securities 
18 U.S.C. § 1341 Mail fraud 
 
In addition, on May 20, 2009, President Obama signed the Fraud Enforcement and 
Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA) into law. This comprehensive legislation expands the reach of 
federal law and increases funding for federal agencies to investigate and prosecute mortgage, 
corporate, and other financial frauds.  
 
Concerning its application to mortgage fraud, FERA makes a number of important changes 
to federal law. Most importantly, FERA expands the definition of financial institution in the 
criminal code (18 U.S.C. § 20 ), thereby extending federal fraud laws to mortgage-lending 
businesses not directly regulated or insured by the federal government. By amending the 
Law  The Law Related to Fraud (Part 2) 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.305 
definition of financial institution, FERA expands the Department of Justice’s authority to 
prosecute mortgage fraud cases as bank fraud and to seek enhanced penalties under the mail 
and wire fraud statutes. As a result, convictions for mortgage fraud can now carry a 30-year 
maximum prison sentence, a maximum $1 million fine, or both.  
 
FERA also amends the false statement in mortgage applications statute (18 U.S.C. § 1014) to 
make it a crime to make a materially false statement or to willfully overvalue a property to 
influence any action by a mortgage-lending business.
