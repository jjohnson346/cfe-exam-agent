Offshore Tax Avoidance and Evasion  
Even though offshore banking is not illegal, federal law requires individuals to disclose any 
offshore accounts to the U.S. government. Generally, the principal disclosure requirement is 
satisfied by filing Treasury Form 90-22.1, the “Report of Foreign Bank and Financial 
Accounts” (FBAR). Specifically, Treasury Department regulations require U.S. citizens and 
resident aliens to file a report when they maintain a financial interest or signature authority 
over a foreign bank account with a balance of more than $10,000 during the calendar year. 
Furthermore, individuals with reportable offshore accounts must acknowledge whether they 
have an offshore account on their tax return.  
 
Violation of these reporting requirements may be  punished by civil or criminal penalties. 
Section 5321 of the Bank Secrecy Act sets forth the civil penalties for noncompliance, 
providing that a covered entity that willfully violates the above reporting requirements can 
be hit with a penalty of up to the amount of the transaction (not to exceed $100,000) or 
$25,000, whichever is greater. In addition, civil tax penalties may be imposed for failing to 
disclose foreign account activity.  
 
The Law Related to Fraud (Part 1)  Law 
2.258  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Generally, tax evasion, (26 U.S.C. § 7201), failure to file a return or pay a tax (26 U.S.C. § 
7203), and making a false tax return (26 U.S.C. § 7206(1)) are the most common criminal 
offenses arising from holding a foreign account. Section 7201 carries a felony charge of not 
more than $100,000 ($500,000 in the case of a corporation) and/or imprisonment for not 
more than five years. A person convicted under section 7203 can be fined up to $100,000 or 
sentenced to up to one year in prison in addition to any other penalties. A person found 
guilty of section 7206 may be subject to a fine of up to $100,000 (or $500,000 in the case of 
a corporation) and/or imprisonment of up to three years.  
 
Recently, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have 
intensified crackdowns on offshore bank accounts, attempting to locate and punish 
individuals that use offshore bank accounts to illegally shield income. This development has 
occurred primarily because offshore tax havens result in lost revenue for the U.S. 
government. In fact, according to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, 
offshore tax evasion costs the United States an estimated $100 billion in lost revenue each 
year.
