Monetary Transactions (31 U.S.C. § 5328) 
Title 31 of the U.S. Code outlines the role of money and finance in the U.S. Code. Section 
5328 contains an anti-retaliation provision, prohibiting financial and nondepository financial 
institutions from discharging or otherwise discriminating against any employees who provide 
information to the secretary of the treasury, the attorney general, or any federal supervisory 
agency about possible violations of Title 31 or its regulations, or of specific anti-money 
laundering laws and transactions by unlicensed money transmitting businesses. To bring a 
claim under section 5328, an individual should file a civil action in federal court within two 
years of the retaliation. If an employee brings a successful claim, courts may grant relief, 
including reinstatement, compensatory damages, and “other appropriate actions to remedy 
any past discrimination.”
