State Statutes 
Every state has some form of legislation protecting whistleblowers. Many are very specific as 
to the manner with which a report must be filed, as well as the particular agencies that must 
receive the report. A particular state also may require that the first report made by an 
employee be directed to the employer under the notion that the employer be given an 
opportunity to correct the circumstances that give rise to a potential violation.
