Counterclaims and Cross-Claims

civil action. A counterclaim (also known as a countersuit) does just what its name implies, it

levels accusations against the original plaintiff, who is now the defendant of the 
counterclaim. The specifics of this claim may be filed as part of the defendant’s answer or as 
a separate document. If a defendant files a counterclaim, it and the original complaint will be 
tried concurrently, with the final judgment stipulating a decision on each side’s petition. 
 
Additionally, if a case involves more than one defendants, a defendant may file a cross-claim  
against one of its co-defendants. A cross-claim is simply an action between co-parties (i.e., 
claims between two defendants or two plaintiffs). The most common occasion for 
counterclaims in a fraud case is when an employer sues an ex-employee for fraud.
