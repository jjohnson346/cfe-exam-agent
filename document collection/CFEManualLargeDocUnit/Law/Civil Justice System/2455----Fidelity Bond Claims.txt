Fidelity Bond Claims 
The fidelity bond claim is an often-overlooked method of recovery for losses due to internal 
fraud. A fidelity bond is a type of policy, which is issued by many large insurance companies, 
under which the insured entity is covered against losses caused by the dishonest or 
fraudulent acts of its employees. Dishonest or fraudulent acts typically are defined as those 
acts committed with the intent to: 
• Cause the insured to sustain a loss 
• Obtain a financial benefit for the employee, or for any third party intended by the 
employee, other than his proper compensation 
 
As with any other insurance agreement, fidelity policies have deductibles, a limit of liability 
(often in the millions of dollars), and certain exclusions. To collect, the insured must submit 
a sworn proof of loss claim within specified time limits, together with supporting evidence 
of liability and the amount of loss. Proof of loss is entirely the responsibility of the insured; 
the carrier will not conduct nor assist in the investigation, nor will it reimburse investigative 
or legal costs incurred in making a claim. 
 
Most policies have express subrogation provisions providing that if the insurance company 
pays a claim, it acquires the rights of the insured to sue the wrongdoer. Policyholders are 
prohibited from interfering with these rights in any way at the risk of jeopardizing coverage, 
such as releasing the wrongdoer from liability. Therefore, no settlement agreements or 
releases should be executed with a dishonest employee or any confederate unless the 
insurance company consents.
