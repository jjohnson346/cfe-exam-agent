Electronic Discovery 
Electronic discovery (e-discovery) refers to the legal discovery process that deals with 
electronically stored information (ESI). ESI is different from paper information because it 
can be stored in larger volumes and in more locations. It is also more volatile. In addition, 
electronic documents usually contain metadata (data about data), which is rarely found in 
paper documents.  
 
Because of ESI’s uniqueness, e-discovery poses additional challenges to the legal process. 
 
PRESERVATION 
The commencement of litigation creates a discovery-related obligation on the parties to 
preserve relevant information whenever litigation is reasonably anticipated. And although the 
duty to preserve is not unique to ESI, electronic information is often difficult to preserve 
The Civil Justice System  Law 
2.608  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
because of its volatile nature. Also, parties who fail to properly preserve evidence (spoliation) 
may be subject to adverse consequences. Thus, it is important to consider the basic 
characteristics of the obligation to preserve information and examine the relevant 
obligations, especially those concerning the preservation of ESI.  
 
To avoid any adverse consequences, companies should establish policies and procedures 
governing the maintenance, storage, and production of ESI. 
 
DOCUMENT RETENTION POLICIES  
Document retention policies that instruct employees on which documents to preserve or 
destroy are an important component of any risk management program. For this reason, 
organizations should adopt such policies, and management must effectively monitor and 
revise them. This is especially important given the growing amount, locations, and formats 
of ESI in today’s environment, which create additional risks and costs for companies that do 
not have such policies for both physical and digital data. 
 
LITIGATION HOLD PROCEDURES  
Organizations should also create litigation hold procedures, which provide a process whereby a 
company issues a litigation hold communication that notifies employees to suspend the 
destruction of potentially relevant records when the duty to preserve relevant information 
arises. The duty to preserve relevant data begins when a lawsuit is “reasonably anticipated.”  
 
There are, however, certain attributes of ESI that make executing a timely litigation hold 
difficult, including: (1) ESI may only be available for a temporary time period, (2) business 
practices are often designed to free up storage space, and (3) ESI is particularly problematic 
because of its sheer volume.  
 
Timely imposing a litigation hold is necessary to avoid sanctions, including monetary fines 
and sanctions, adverse inference jury instruction sanctions, or dismissal of claims or 
defenses.  
 
SAFE HARBOR 
FRCP 37 allows courts to order sanctions for a party’s failure to make disclosures or to 
cooperate in discovery, but, as amended, Rule 37 contains a “safe harbor” provision, 
providing that courts cannot impose sanctions on a company for failing to provide ESI that 
was lost because of routine data management practices. Nevertheless, it is important to note 
Law  The Civil Justice System 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.609 
that ignorance is no defense against how a party’s electronic information is stored. 
 
INADVERTENT PRODUCTION OF PRIVILEGED ESI 
FRCP 26 provides that if a party has inadvertently produced ESI that is later determined to 
be privileged, the receiving party must destroy and refrain from using any protected 
information until any dispute is resolved. This rule recognizes that reviewing large volumes 
of ESI for attorney-client privileged material is generally more costly and time consuming 
than traditional document recovery. This rule, however, does not provide guidance for 
determining whether or not producing the material waives the privilege.  
 
On September 19, 2008, President Bush signed into law a bill adding Evidence Rule 502 to 
the Federal Rules of Evidence. This rule protects against the inadvertent waiver of the 
attorney-client privilege or the work product protection. See the “Basic Principles of 
Evidence” chapter below for further discussion of this rule.  
 
ESI FROM SOURCES THAT ARE NOT REASONABLY ACCESSIBLE 
FRCP 26 also makes a distinction between ESI that is reasonably accessible and that which 
is not. The relevant provision states that a party need not provide discovery of ESI “from 
sources that the party identifies as ‘not reasonably accessible’ because of undue burden or 
cost.”  
 
The rule, however, does not define what is reasonably accessible. Accordingly, disputes will 
continue to center on how “accessible” the information is and what constitutes “undue 
burden or cost.” Thus, at the outset of fores eeable litigation, parties should understand the 
scope and sources of their electronic information that may be related to the case, as well as 
the information’s location and format. Thereafter, it will be the court’s responsibility to 
reconcile disagreements between the parties as to what electronic information is and is not 
reasonably accessible. 
 
THE FORM OF PRODUCTION 
FRCP 34 also provides procedures for resolving any form of production issues. Specifically, 
Rule 34 requires that, where a party objects to the form for producing the electronic 
information, or if no form is specified in a request for information, “the responding party 
must state the form or forms it intends to use.” Furthermore, if a request does not specify a 
form for producing the electronic information, the “responding party must produce the 
information in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained … or that are reasonably 
The Civil Justice System  Law 
2.610  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
usable.” Given the specificity of Rule 34, parties should decide the format they need prior to 
requesting electronic information from the opponent. 
 
BECOMING LITIGATION READY 
The recent amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure concerning the discovery of 
ESI are exposing companies to further liabilities and costs during litigation because they 
require organizations to adapt how they manage, retain, store, and deliver ESI during legal 
proceedings. The amendments provide that, in most circumstances, parties must voluntarily 
turn over (i.e., without awaiting a discovery request by the other party) a copy, or a 
description by category and location, of all ESI to the other party within 14 days of the pre-
 trial conference. Therefore, it is essential that parties (or organizations) be prepared for the 
advent of electronic discovery prior to a case being filed, or in other words, companies must 
be litigation ready. To be litigation ready, parties (or organizations) must know the scope of 
their ESI, the location of their ESI, the storage format of their ESI, the length of time ESI is 
stored, and whether their ESI is readily accessible.
