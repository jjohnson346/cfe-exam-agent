Basic Principles of Criminal Law 
Whereas civil law is that body of law that provides remedies for violations of private rights, 
criminal law deals with offenses of a public nature. A criminal defendant in a federal or state 
court is presumed innocent. He also has the right to remain silent, to confront accusers, to 
be advised by counsel, to have a speedy trial in front of peers, as well as other protections. 
And under the U.S. criminal justice system, the government bears the burden of proving the 
accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and it is expected to scrupulously observe the 
rights of the defendant.  
 
Also, in the criminal system, the government must adhere to the principal guarantees of 
individual rights, which are established by the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. These 
amendments are applied to the states under the “due process” clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment.  
 
The procedures described in this chapter primarily refer to federal rules. Individual state 
procedures might differ. 
 
Fourth Amendment 
To review, the Fourth Amendment guarantees the right of all citizens to be free from 
unreasonable searches and seizures; it provides the right of people to be: 
 
… secure in their persons, ho uses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and 
seizure, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported 
by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or 
things to be seized. 
 
Fifth Amendment 
The Fifth Amendment guarantees subjects of a criminal investigation the right to refuse to 
answer questions or to provide certain personal information that might be incriminating. 
The text of this amendments states: 
 
No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a 
presentment of indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or 
in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be

subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall he be compelled 
in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, 
without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just 
compensation. 
 
Sixth Amendment 
The Sixth Amendment affords subjects in a criminal investigation the right to counsel, the 
right to confront (cross-examine) the witnesses against them, and the right to a speedy trial: 
 
In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to speedy and public trial, by an 
impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which 
district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause 
of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for 
obtaining witnesses in his favor; and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense. 
 
Fourteenth Amendment 
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates these federal rights 
and makes them applicable to the states. The Fourteenth Amendment provides: 
 
Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction 
thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall 
make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the 
United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due 
process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
