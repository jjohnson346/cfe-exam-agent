Common Legal Issues in Fraud Cases 
Two general types of legal issue — one subst antive, the other procedural — are often 
encountered in fraud examinations. The substantive issue includes the proving of each 
element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, including the element of intent (if intent, 
in fact, is an element). The procedural issue includes the right to counsel and the manner in 
which fraud examiners employed by law enforcement have conducted arrests, searches and

seizures, and interrogations. Fraud examiners are most likely to encounter legal problems 
over such issues as the condition, organization, and sanctity of their work papers and their 
audit assumptions if the case is based on an accounting hypothesis (net worth method, for 
example). 
 
Often, accounting data used as evidence is challenged as not meeting the hearsay exceptions. 
In general, the issues that arise with such evidence is whether the proffered documentary 
evidence is the “best” evidence, and whether secondary evidence is admissible when the best 
evidence is unavailable.  
 
Similarly, questions about the business records exception to the hearsay rule often arise. That 
is, a party questions whether a record was made in the ordinary course of doing business or 
was made in books of account contemporaneously with a business transaction.  
 
Another issue often encountered is the expertness of a fraud examiner called to provide 
expert testimony (opinion evidence). A party may challenge an expert witness’s credentials, 
and they may call another expert to question the first expert’s opinions.
