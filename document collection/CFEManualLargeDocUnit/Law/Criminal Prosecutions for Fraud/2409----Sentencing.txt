Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud

Sentencing 
Following a guilty verdict, the judge must impose a sentence without unnecessary delay. 
Prior to the sentencing hearing, a probation officer will prepare a pre-sentence report that 
will review the defendant’s character, background, associates, prior criminal record, and 
other factors relevant to setting an appropriate sentence. The report will recommend a

2.524  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
particular sentence or range of sentence. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure require 
that the pre-sentence report contain a victim impact statement, that is, an assessment of the 
financial, social, psychological, and medical impact upon, and cost to, the victim of the 
crime. This information may be used to set the punishment or to support a possible 
restitution order. The defendant and his counsel are allowed to review all or parts of the 
probation report except the sentencing recommendation. 
 
At the sentencing hearing, the defendant, counsel, and the prosecutor may be heard before a 
sentence is imposed. The court may impose a fine, a term of imprisonment, or both, or place 
the defendant on probation for a specified period and under certain conditions. The court 
may order restitution to the victims in addition to a fine or prison term, or as a condition of 
probation. A federal statute provides that a defendant who has been found guilty of fraud 
may be ordered to give notice to the victims, apparently to protect the public from further 
fraudulent acts by the defendant and to alert the victims to the possibility of civil recoveries. 
 
Sentences of imprisonment for two or more offenses may be ordered to run consecutively 
or concurrently, depending on the nature and severity of the offenses and other factors. In 
federal court, a defendant may be fined up to twice the pecuniary gain realized from the 
crime, or twice the loss sustained by the victim as an alternative to the statutory amounts. 
 
Sentencing Guidelines 
The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 provided for the development of guidelines for the 
sentencing of individual and organizational offenders. The individual guidelines became 
effective in 1987, and the guidelines for organizations in 1991. In April 2010, the U.S. 
Sentencing Commission modified sentencing guidelines for organizations, especially as they 
relate to compliance programs. The changes will become effective on November 1, 2010, 
barring any Congressional modifications or rejection. 
 
Individual Guidelines 
Under the guidelines, sentencing determinations are made by cross-referencing the base offense 
level assigned to a particular offense with the “defendant’s criminal history category.” There 
are 43 basic offense levels (murder and treason being level 43 offenses) and six criminal 
history categories. Adjustments may be made up or down in each table based on the 
particular facts and circumstances of the case. For example, the base offense level for crimes 
involving fraud or deceit is six, but if the fraud involved a loss of more than $2,000, more 
than minimal planning, or other aggravating circumstances, the base offense level can be 
Law  Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.525 
substantially increased. The final applicable offense level is then coordinated with the 
criminal history category of the defendant (which is computed on a point basis according to 
the number and type of previous convictions and other factors) to arrive at the final 
sentencing level. The court may depart from the recommended sentence if unique factors 
are present, but any such departure must be supported by specific reasons. 
 
As an example, a defendant with no prior convictions convicted of fraud involving the loss 
of $10,000 would be sentenced to a term of four to 10 months, absent unusual 
circumstances. If the fraud resulted in the loss of $1 million, involved more than minimal 
planning, and was perpetrated by a defendant who had a previous conviction punishable by 
more than a year in prison, the recommended term of imprisonment would be 41 to 51 
months. Under the Sentencing Act, the defendant will serve a substantial amount of the 
sentence he receives (a small reduction is possible for good behavior); the Sentencing Act 
abolished parole in federal cases. 
 
Sentencing of Organizations 
The sentencing guidelines for organizations were designed to reconcile the wide disparity in 
federal sentencing.  
 
Corporations and other organizations may be criminally liable for offenses committed by 
their agents if committed in the scope of the agent’s duty and with the intended purpose of 
benefiting the organization. 
 
Sentencing guidelines for organizations indicate that: 
• The court must, whenever practicable, order the organization to remedy any harm 
caused by the offense. 
• If the organization operated primarily for a criminal purpose, the fine should be set 
sufficiently high to divest the organization of all assets. 
• The fine range for any other organization should be based on the seriousness of the 
offense and the culpability of the organization. Culpability generally will be determined 
by the steps taken by the organization prior to the offense to prevent and detect criminal 
conduct, the extent of involvement in or tolerance of the offense by the organization’s 
personnel, and the organization’s response after an offense had been committed. 
 
SETTING THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE 
When an organization is convicted of a federal offense, the fine it must pay is determined by 
Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud  Law 
2.526  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
calculating the “base fine” and any culpability multiplier. First, the base fine is arrived at by 
determining the greatest of: 
• The amount from the offense level fine table 
• The pecuniary gain to the organization from the offense 
• The pecuniary loss from the offense caused by the organization, to the extent the loss 
was caused intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly 
  
The fine amounts on the base offense level fine table range from $5,000 to $72,500,000. 
Next the court calculates the appropriate multipliers for the base fine level, depending on the 
particular circumstances. Factors that are considered include: 
• Involvement in or tolerance of criminal activity 
• History 
• Whether the organization violated a judicial order or injunction during the offense 
• The existence of an effective program to prevent and detect violations of law 
• Any self-reporting, cooperation, and acceptance of responsibility 
• Obstruction of justice by the organization 
 
The culpability score is then converted to a multiplier that generates the recommended fine 
range. The court will consider a number of additional factors to determine where in the 
range the actual fine will be imposed. An organization must be ordered to serve a period of 
probation if the court finds that: 
• It is necessary to secure payment of restitution, to enforce a remedial order, or to ensure 
completion of community service 
• If a monetary penalty is ordered and has not been paid at the time of sentencing and 
probation is necessary to ensure payment 
• It is necessary to ensure that changes are made to reduce the likelihood of crime 
• It is necessary to accomplish Sentencing Act purposes 
• If the defendant organization sentence does not include a fine 
 
The length of probation may not exceed five years. In addition, the court has discretion to 
order the defendant organization to publicize its conviction and the nature of the offense. 
The court also may order the organization to make periodic reports to the court or the 
probation department and subject itself to unannounced examinations of its books and 
records. Finally, the court may order the organization to develop and submit for court 
approval an effective compliance program.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.527 
EFFECTIVE PROGRAM TO DETECT AND PREVENT VIOLATIONS OF LAW 
Under the guidelines, if a convicted organization has an effective compliance program in 
place at the time of the offense, the sentencing judge will consider the organization’s acts of 
due diligence in trying to prevent the illegality when deciding whether to increase or mitigate 
the sentence. The guidelines define effective compliance program  as one that is reasonably 
designed, implemented, and enforced so that it generally will be effective in preventing and 
detecting criminal conduct.  
 
The most significant change under the modified sentencing guidelines for organizations 
concerns the sentence reduction credit for having an effective compliance program. Before 
the guidelines were modified, organizations were disqualified from receiving a reduction in 
sentencing for maintaining an effective compliance program if a “high-level person” was 
involved with the fraudulent activity. Under the modified guidelines, however, involvement 
of a high-level person is no longer an automatic bar from effective compliance program 
credit, but the amendments impose several conditions to receive a reduction under these 
circumstances, including a direct reporting requirement to the governing authority (board or 
audit committee).  
 
See the chapter on “Fraud Prevention Programs” in the Fraud Prevention and Deterrence 
section of the Fraud Examiners Manual for more information about developing a corporate 
compliance policy. 
 
DUE DILIGENCE 
The organization must take at least seven minimum steps to meet the requirement of due 
diligence: 
• Implement policies defining standards and procedures to be followed by the 
organization’s agents and employees 
• Assign specific high-level personnel ultimate responsibility to ensure compliance 
• Use due care not to delegate significant discretionary authority to people whom the 
organization knows or should have known had a propensity to engage in illegal activities 
• Communicate standards and procedures to all agents and employees and require 
participation in training programs 
• Take reasonable steps to achieve compliance, e.g., by the use of monitoring and auditing 
systems, and by having and publicizing a reporting system where employees can refer 
criminal conduct without fear of retribution (hot line or ombudsman program) 
  
Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud  Law 
2.528  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
• Consistently enforce standards through appropriate discipline ranging from reprimand to 
dismissal 
• After detection of an offense, the organization must take all reasonable steps to 
appropriately respond to the offense and to prevent further similar offenses, including 
modifying its program and appropriate discipline for the individuals responsible for the 
offense and for those who failed to detect it
