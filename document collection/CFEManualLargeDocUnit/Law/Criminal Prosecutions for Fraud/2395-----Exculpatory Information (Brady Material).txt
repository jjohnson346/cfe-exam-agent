Exculpatory Information (Brady Material) 
The prosecutor has an ethical responsibility not to use evidence that is false and must correct 
testimony that he knows is false. In 1963, the Supreme Court (in the case of Brady v. 
Maryland, 373 U.S. 83) expanded the prosecution’s duty further. Under Brady, the 
prosecution must disclose all evidence requested by the defendant that is material to guilt or 
punishment (i.e., evidence that would tend to exculpate  him or reduce his penalty). The 
Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud  Law 
2.516  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
government is expressly forbidden from concealing evidence that would call the charges into 
question.
