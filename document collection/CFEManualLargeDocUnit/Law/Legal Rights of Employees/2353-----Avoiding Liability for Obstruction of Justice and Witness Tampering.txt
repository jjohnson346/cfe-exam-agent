Avoiding Liability for Obstruction of Justice and Witness Tampering 
It is assumed that no CFE would knowingly or intentionally suborn perjury, conceal 
evidence, or otherwise attempt to undermine a government investigation or a judicial 
proceeding. But it is important to understand the potential for liability for these offenses 
during a fraud examination. 
 
To understand what conduct could lead to accusations of impropriety or criminal liability, 
fraud examiners should be familiar with the following federal statutes. There may be 
additional state statutes that prohibit similar conduct in connection with state investigations 
or even state civil lawsuits. An attorney should be consulted for the law of a specific 
jurisdiction.
