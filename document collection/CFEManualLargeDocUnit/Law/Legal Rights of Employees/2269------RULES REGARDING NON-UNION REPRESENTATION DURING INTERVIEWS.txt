RULES REGARDING NON-UNION REPRESENTATION DURING INTERVIEWS 
In June 2004, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) overruled a controversial 
decision regarding the rights of non-union employees to have a “representative” present 
during interviews, and reinstated the former 1975 ruling that non-union employees are not 
entitled to representation during investigatory interviews (I BM Corp., 341 NLRB No. 148 
(2004)). The NLRB reasoned that allowing co-workers to sit in as representatives during 
investigatory interviews would compromise the requisite confidentiality, sensitivity, and 
thoroughness of the interview. Accordingly, non-union employers no longer have a legal 
obligation to accept an employee’s request for such representation.
