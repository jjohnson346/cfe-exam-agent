Employee’s Constitutional Rights 
The United States Constitution protects individuals from abuse of governmental power, and 
several Constitutional provisions can come into play in the course of a fraud investigation. 
The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and

seizures. The Fifth Amendment provides that a person cannot be compelled to give 
information that might incriminate him. The Sixth Amendment provides that a person has 
the right to an attorney and to confront the witnesses against him. Additionally, while the 
Constitution contains no express guarantee of privacy, courts have found that individual 
privacy rights are implied from many of the express protections in the Bill of Rights. 
 
The general rule is that the United States Constitution only limits government action; it does 
not limit the powers of private employers in conducting a corporate investigation. That rule, 
however, is subject to several limitations, and, although a private employer usually cannot be 
sued for a violation of the Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendments, these provisions still have 
important implications for the fraud investigator.
