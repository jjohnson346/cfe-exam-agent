Invasion of Privacy 
In some states, courts have defined polygraph tests as invasions of privacy. Questions 
directly related to job performance or the incident under investigation generally are held not 
to be invasions of privacy. Control questions might be an invasion of privacy, though 
circumstances might warrant the intrusion. Check with counsel.
