Polygraph Examinations 
 
Employee Polygraph Protection Act 
The Employee Polygraph Protection Act prohibits the use of polygraphs by most private 
employers unless the employer is engaged in an ongoing investigation involving economic 
loss or injury to the employer in the employer’s business, and has a reasonable suspicion that 
the employee is involved in the incident. Reasonable suspicion is an observable, articulated basis 
in fact; it is similar to predication.  
 
Employers subject to this Act cannot use polygraphs to screen applicants for employment, 
and they cannot discharge an employee for refusing to take a polygraph exam.  
 
The Employee Polygraph Protection Act, however, does not protect government employees. 
 
Other Federal Statutes 
Other statu tes do not address the use of polygraphs directly, but nonetheless might give rise 
to liability if a polygraph test is administered in a discriminatory fashion (e.g., based on race, 
sex, or some other prohibited factor), or used to ferret out union sympathies in connection 
with a union organizing campaign. 
 
State Statutes 
Several states have enacted laws addressing the use of polygraph examinations, and some are 
more restrictive than the federal statute. Courts have recognized claims arising from 
unlawful administration of polygraph exams and wrongful discharge for refusal to take an 
exam after having been accused of fraud.

Common Law Liability from Polygraph Exams 
In addition to the statutory restrictions discussed above, some courts have found the use of 
polygraphs actionable on common law grounds under certain circumstances. 
 
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress 
Most courts have found that the circumstances surrounding the giving of a polygraph exam 
do not, in and of themselves, rise to the level of outrageous conduct, as required to state a 
common law claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
 
Invasion of Privacy 
In some states, courts have defined polygraph tests as invasions of privacy. Questions 
directly related to job performance or the incident under investigation generally are held not 
to be invasions of privacy. Control questions might be an invasion of privacy, though 
circumstances might warrant the intrusion. Check with counsel. 
 
Wrongful Discharge 
Polygraph exams may also give rise to claims of wrongful discharge. For example, a former 
employee may bring a wrongful discharge claim if he is terminated for refusing to take a 
polygraph exam after having been accused of fraud.
