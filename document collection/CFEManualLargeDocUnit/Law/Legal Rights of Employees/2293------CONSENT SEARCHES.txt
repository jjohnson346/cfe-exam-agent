CONSENT SEARCHES 
Individuals are always free to waive their Fourth Amendment rights. If a suspect consents to 
a search by police, this eliminates the need for a warrant. The courts, however, will closely 
scrutinize any such “consent” to make sure it was truly voluntary, particularly when it leads 
to the seizure of incriminating evidence. Consents obtained by deceit, bribery, or 
misrepresentations are generally held to be involuntary and invalid. (However, when an 
undercover police officer conceals his identity and, as a result, an individual allows the 
officer to enter an area, this amounts to consent, even though the person did not know 
permission was being granted to a police officer.) Consent might not be voluntary if it requires 
a choice between exercising constitutional rights and continued employment. There is also 
no requirement that suspects be informed of their right to refuse consent.  
 
Consent may be implied in circumstances in which the individual can choose between 
entering an area and submitting to a search or not entering, as when one enters a secured 
courthouse, boards an airplane, or crosses an international border. Consent may be given by 
third parties to searches of property over which the third parties have authority, such as a co-
 tenant in a leased apartment.
