Surveillance 
An employer, in certain circumstances, can use monitoring and surveillance methods to 
uncover employee wrongdoing. Various federal and state laws govern the availability and 
methods of surveillance techniques. Because of the complexity of these laws and the 
differing interpretations of them by state and federal courts, counsel should always be 
consulted beforehand. For example, if an employer monitors employees’ phone calls without 
following the proper legal procedure, the employer might violate federal or state wiretap 
laws. The employer might also expose itself to substantial legal liability for invasion of 
privacy. 
 
To lower the expectation of privacy and to preserve the right to search any and all areas and 
to monitor and survey employee conduct, the employer should adopt a written policy which 
provides that to maintain the security of its operations, the company might gain access to 
and search all work areas and personal belongings, including desks, file drawers, lockers, 
briefcases, handbags, pockets, and personal effects. Include in the policy that workplace 
areas are subject to surveillance and that business phone calls might be monitored. In 
addition, as discussed below, the policy also should state that the employer could monitor all 
electronic communications, such as e-mail, as well as monitor what sites are visited over the 
Internet.
