Invasion of Privacy 
While modern tort law includes four categories of invasion of privacy, this discussion only 
addresses the two most common forms of invasion of privacy applicable to fraud 
examinations: intrusion upon seclusion and public disclosure of private facts. 
 
INTRUSION INTO SECLUSION 
Intrusion upon seclusion occurs when an individual intentionally intrudes “upon the solitude 
or seclusion of another or his private affairs or concerns” and “the intrusion would be highly 
offensive to a reasonable person.” Questioning employees about activities not related to job 
performance might constitute an invasion of privacy. 
 
Individual Rights During Examinations Law 
2.414  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
The elements of this tort include:  
• An intentional intrusion 
• Into an area where an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy 
• The intrusion would be highly offensive or objectionable to a reasonable person  
 
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE FACTS 
The tort of public disclosure of private facts occurs when one party makes public statements 
about another party’s private life that are not of public concern. For instance, disclosing 
information obtained in an interview to individuals not involved in the investigation. 
 
Unlike defamation claims, which are discussed below, this cause of action can arise even if 
the statements are true. The key is that the information is private in nature and it is not a 
matter of public interest.
