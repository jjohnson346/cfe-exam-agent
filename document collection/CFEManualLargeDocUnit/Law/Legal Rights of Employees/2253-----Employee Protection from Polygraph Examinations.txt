Employee Protection from Polygraph Examinations 
The Employee Polygraph Protection Act prohibits the use of polygraphs by most private 
employers, unless the employer is engaged in an ongoing investigation involving economic 
loss or injury to the employer in the employer’s business and has a reasonable suspicion that 
the employee is involved in the incident. 
 
Employers subject to this Act cannot use polygraphs to screen applicants for employment, 
and they cannot discharge an employee for refusing to take an exam. This Act, however, 
does not protect government employees.  
 
In addition, some courts have found the use of polygraphs actionable on common law 
grounds under certain circumstances. For example, some state courts have held that 
polygraph tests can constitute an invasion of privacy.
