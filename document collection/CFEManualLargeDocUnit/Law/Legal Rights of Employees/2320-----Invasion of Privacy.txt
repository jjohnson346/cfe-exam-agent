Invasion of Privacy 
Employees also have common law privacy interests that limit an employer’s right to search. 
These common law protections, which are similar in nature and scope to the Fourth 
Amendment protections discussed above, cover both public and private employees. As long 
as an employee does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in an area, the employer 
can search that area without violating an employee’s common law right to privacy.

2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.435 
While modern tort law includes four categories of invasion of privacy, this discussion only 
addresses two of those torts: publicity of private facts and intrusion upon seclusion. 
 
INTRUSION INTO SECLUSION 
Intrusion upon seclusion is the cause of action that is most frequently raised with regard to 
workplace searches. As stated before, intrusion upon seclusion occurs when an individual 
intentionally intrudes “upon the solitude or secl usion of another or his private affairs or 
concerns” and “the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.” Thus, 
where there is an expectation of privacy on the part of the employee, a search without cause 
might give rise to a claim of invasion of privacy. The mere gathering of information is not a 
tort; however, the gathering of confidential information where the intrusion is unreasonable 
might be a tort. There is no invasion of privacy if the information is open to public view or 
has been disclosed to others. 
 
As with constitutional actions, an intrusion upon seclusion claim can be based not only on 
physical intrusions, but also on wiretapping, eavesdropping and other forms of surveillance. 
 
An employer can eliminate the potential for claim of invasion of privacy by publishing and 
following a “search” policy. In addition, the following measures can be taken: 
• Having a written policy regarding searches, surveillance, and telephone monitoring 
• Retaining a key to all desks, lockers, etc. 
• Requiring employees to provide keys to all personal locks 
• Obtaining consent to search 
 
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE FACTS 
The tort of public disclosure of private facts occurs when one party makes public statements 
about another party’s private life that are not of public concern. The disclosure of those facts 
must be highly offensive to a reasonable person. This tort can exist even if the statements 
are true. Because giving unreasonable publicity to true, but private, information about an 
employee can give rise to a claim for invasion of privacy, the need to communicate 
information about the employee must be balanced against the intrusion into the employee’s 
privacy.
