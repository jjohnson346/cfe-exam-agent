Interviews 
 
Introduction 
Interviews, and especially admission-seeking interviews, may expose the company and the 
fraud examiner to certain legal risks. Thus, before engaging in an interview, the examiner 
must understand the ramifications of their actions, which requires an understanding of 
certain legal issues and how they limit or affect the ways in which an interview may be 
conducted. The following is an overview of some of the most common legal issues that may 
affect interview situations.   
 
And since employee rights vary from case to case, fraud examiners should always consult 
with an attorney regarding the specific laws and regulations for their state or locality. 
 
Restrictions on Employee Interviews 
In the context of an internal investigation, employees of private entities generally do not 
enjoy constitutional protections. However, they may possess contractual rights that must be 
respected during the course of an interview. For example, an employee covered by a 
collective-bargaining agreement may have the right to have a representative present during 
the interview.  
 
Thus, it is in the company’s best interest to review all aspects of the employer-employee 
relationship, including company policies, contractual relationships, and prevailing law before 
conducting the interview.   
 
Individual Rights During Examinations Law 
2.406  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
Employee’s Right Against Self-Incrimination 
The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that a person cannot be 
compelled to give information that may incriminate him in a criminal case. It provides:  
 
No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a 
presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or 
in the militia, when in actual service in time of war and public danger; nor shall any person be 
subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in 
any criminal case to be a witness ag ainst himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, 
without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just 
compensation. 
 
The Fifth Amendment’s right against self-incrimination contains two basic protections: it 
protects a person from being forced to give information that could be used to convict him 
of a criminal offense, and it prevents the state from punishing an employee for his silence or 
otherwise using his exercise of that right against him. 
 
Public Employers 
As stated above, constitutional protections generally only apply to public employees. This 
means that employees of federal, state, and local governments must be afforded protection 
under the Fifth Amendment. A public employer cannot fire employees for refusing to 
answer questions that might incriminate them. The leading case on this issue is Garrity v. New 
Jersey, 385 U.S. 493 (1967). In Garrity, several New Jersey police officers were threatened with 
dismissal from their jobs if they refused to answer questions relating to a conspiracy to 
obstruct traffic laws. The officers, faced with termination, answered the questions and were 
subsequently prosecuted. The U.S. Supreme Court found that the statements had been 
improperly coerced and thus they were not admissible at trial.  
 
The Fifth Amendment only protects persons against compelled  testimony. Thus, if an 
employee voluntarily confesses to a crime, they can be fired without violating their 
constitutional rights. The confession, however, must be truly voluntary; the employee cannot 
be coerced in any way to give self-incriminating evidence during an interview.  
 
If a public employer or government official wants to compel an employee to provide 
answers with potential criminal liability and administrative consequences, they may get 
written approval to offer the employee a Kalkines warning. Kalkines warnings are a form of 
Law  Individual Rights During Examinations 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.407 
immunity that precludes prosecution against the employee for statements derived from the 
compelled testimony. However, this immunity does not prevent prosecution against the 
employee where the government received evidence from a legitimate independent source, 
and it does not prevent prosecution of an employee for providing the government with false 
statements or answers. Additionally, if an employee refuses to answer questions after 
receiving a proper Kalkines warning, the public employer may take disciplinary actions, 
including dismissal.  
 
It should also be noted that the right against self-incrimination only applies in criminal cases. 
Thus, an employee — public or private — can be fired for refusing to answer a question when 
the answer will only lead to an administrative punishment or a civil suit, but not to criminal 
conviction. Furthermore, in a civil lawsuit, it is permissible to draw an adverse inference 
from the fact that an employee refused to answer an incriminating question; it is not 
permissible to draw a negative inference in a criminal case from refusal to answer such a 
question.  
 
In practice, however, it may be very difficult to draw the distinction between questions that 
will lead to criminal prosecution and those that will only lead to civil or administrative 
punishments. If an employee is compelled to answer a question and the answer provides 
evidence of criminal wrongdoing that was previously unknown, that evidence could be 
inadmissible in a subsequent criminal case. It is a better practice not to compel answers from 
public employees in any setting so that constitutional issues can be avoided.  
 
Even if a setting is deemed noncustodial and Miranda warnings are not required, this does not 
eliminate the public employee’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. 
Regardless of the setting, a public employer cannot compel its employees to choose between 
their constitutional rights and their job.  
 
Private Employers 
The Fifth Amendment generally does not apply to private employers because, in the absence 
of a state action, there is no constitutional protection against self-incrimination. Therefore, 
an employee might be subject to dismissal by a private company if he fails to cooperate in an 
investigation. However, there are situations, as discussed above, where private companies 
may be held liable for violating their employees’ constitutional rights. When there is a 
sufficient nexus between a regulated company and the government such that the private 
company essentially acts as an agent of the government, then that private company’s actions 
will be treated as actions of the government itself. In such a case, constitutional protections 
for the private company’s employees are triggered.  
 
The key to the determination is whether the private company is acting on behalf of the 
government as an agent of the government. For example, if a private entity were directed by the 
Individual Rights During Examinations Law 
2.408  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
police to interview its employees in connection with a crime, this entity would be acting as 
an agent of the police. In this situation, the private company’s employees could not be 
terminated for refusing to answer questions that might incriminate them.  
 
It should also be noted that some states have expanded the rights of private employees to 
include protections for certain constitutional rights. Thus, an interviewer should consult with 
an attorney before taking any adverse action against an employee who refuses to answer 
potentially incriminating questions.  
 
Miranda Warnings 
Designed to protect an individual’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, 
Miranda warnings advice suspects that they have the right not to answer questions and the 
right to legal counsel during interrogations. Miranda warnings are required only if a person is 
being interrogated by public authorities in a custodial setting. Custodial setting refers to 
questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody, 
or otherwise deprived of his freedom or action in any significant way. As a result, both 
private and public employers might interview employees in noncustodial settings without 
giving Miranda warnings. 
 
In subsequent civil proceedings, an adverse inference might be drawn from silence in 
response to questioning. 
 
Presence of Corporate Attorney 
Although Miranda warnings might not be required, a company’s attorney may conduct or be 
present during the interview of company employees. Because the company’s lawyer 
represents only the interests of the company and not those of the individual employee, an 
employee who is being interviewed must not be permitted — or misled — to believe that the 
company’s lawyer represents his interests during an interview. For this reason, if a corporate 
attorney is present during the interview, it is good policy to inform the employee of several 
things before the interview begins. Counsel should inform the employee of the following: 
Law  Individual Rights During Examinations 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.409 
• Counsel represents the company, not the employee. 
• The purpose of the interview is to obtain information to provide legal advice to the 
company. 
• Information provided by the employee initially will be treated as confidential, but the 
company ultimately will determine whether to disclose the information to law 
enforcement agencies. 
• The employee is expected to answer the questions fully and truthfully. 
 
The employee should not discuss the interview with anyone (either inside or outside the 
company) except his attorney. 
 
Depending on the circumstances, the attorney might also wish to advise the employee that 
he is free to retain an attorney. Factors to include in determining whether to give such advice 
include the degree of evidence of the employee’s culpability, whether the evidence is such to 
draw a conclusion concerning a violation of the law, the likelihood of criminal prosecution if 
the results of the investigation are disclosed, the existence of a conflict of interest between 
the employee and the company, and state ethical codes. 
 
Employee’s Right to Counsel 
The Sixth Amendment affords subjects in a criminal investigation the right to counsel. The 
relevant text provides:  
 
In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right … to be confronted with witnesses 
against him, to have compulsory process for obta ining witnesses in his favor, and to have the 
assistance of counsel for his defense. 
 
Applicability 
If no state action is involved, a private employer can interview an employee without the 
presence of his attorney. However, the employee, an individual, always has the right to 
consult an attorney, but there is typically no legal obligation to consult the employee’s lawyer 
prior to the interview or allow the employee’s lawyer to sit in during an interview. 
 
Whether an employee will be permitted to be accompanied by a representative during an 
interview generally depends on the particular circumstances. If the employee is covered by a 
collective-bargaining agreement, for example, the terms of the agreement will generally 
control whether a representative can be present. In the absence of such circumstances, the 
Individual Rights During Examinations Law 
2.410  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
general rule is that it is at the company’s discretion whether it will allow the employee to be 
represented during an interview. 
 
Employee’s Right to Due Process 
The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees the right to due process: 
 
All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are 
citizens of the United States and of  the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce 
any law, which shall abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States; nor 
shall any state deprive any person of life, libert y, or property without due process of law; nor 
deny to any person within its jurisdict ion the equal protection of the laws … 
 
In the context of a fraud investigation, the constitutional right to due process usually refers 
to procedural rights that must be observed before the employee suffers any adverse 
consequence. Again, the right to due process usually is not applicable to employees of 
private companies. State or federal employers, however, might be required to provide the 
wrongdoing employee with the following: 
• Written notice of the charges 
• Adequate opportunity to rebut any charges brought prior to any disciplinary action being 
taken, which might include the right to call witnesses and the right to be represented by 
an attorney 
 
Even in the absence of constitutional due process protections, similar procedures to ensure 
fundamental fairness may be required even of private employers because of contractual 
provisions, collective bargaining agreements, established company policies, or applicable 
labor or employment statutes. Thus, private employers might also wish to employ the above 
procedures to avoid a possible civil suit by the employee. 
 
State Constitutions 
Many states have constitutional provisions concerning self-incrimination, right to counsel, 
and due process. The law of your particular state should be examined closely. In some 
instances, state constitutions provide broader protections than the U.S. Constitution. 
 
Federal Statutes 
National Labor Relations Act 
The National Labor Relations Act prohibits any form of interrogation by employers that 
Law Individual Rights During Examinations 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.411 
interferes with the rights of the employee to organize, bargain, or otherwise engage in 
concerted activities for the purpose of bargaining or other mutual aid or protection. An 
employer might not question an employee about any of these protected activities, either his 
own or that of other employees. 
 
RULES REGARDING NON-UNION REPRESENTATION DURING INTERVIEWS 
In June 2004, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) overruled a controversial 
decision regarding the rights of non-union employees to have a “representative” present 
during interviews, and reinstated the former 1975 ruling that non-union employees are not 
entitled to representation during investigatory interviews (I BM Corp., 341 NLRB No. 148 
(2004)). The NLRB reasoned that allowing co-workers to sit in as representatives during 
investigatory interviews would compromise the requisite confidentiality, sensitivity, and 
thoroughness of the interview. Accordingly, non-union employers no longer have a legal 
obligation to accept an employee’s request for such representation.  
 
UNION EMPLOYEES  
Since 1975 and the U.S. Supreme Court decision of NLRB v. Weingarten, 420 U.S. 251 (1975), 
union employees have had the right to union representation during an investigatory 
interview, provided that the employee “reasonably believes” the interview “might result in 
disciplinary action.” This right derived from the National Labor Relations Act, which 
provides that employees have the right “to act in concert for mutual aid and protection.” In 
the years since Weingarten, this right has only been applied in cases where the employee under 
investigation was covered by a collective-bargaining agreement. 
 
FORMER LAW: NON-UNION EMPLOYEES  
In the case of Epilepsy Foundation of Northeast Ohio (331 NLRB No. 92; decided July 10, 2000), 
the NLRB extended the so-called Weingarten rights to non-union employees. The case involved 
two workers who were fired from the Epilepsy Foundation. Prior to their discharge, the two 
employees wrote a memo that was critical of their supervisor. Later, the executive director 
requested to meet with one of the employees and the supervisor. The employee requested to 
meet with the executive director alone, but the request was denied. The employee then asked 
if the co-author of the memo could be present at the meeting. This request was also denied. 
When the employee still expressed apprehension about the meeting, he was told to go home, 
and he was fired the next day for insubordination. 
 
The NLRB ruled that discharging the employee for refusing to attend the meeting violated 
Individual Rights During Examinations Law 
2.412  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
the National Labor Relations Act. A majority of the board felt that the rights set forth in 
Weingarten should apply equally in circumstances in which employees are not represented by 
a union. They reasoned that the right to have a co-worker present at an investigatory 
interview “greatly enhances the employees’ opportunities to act in concert to address the 
concern that the employer does not initiate or continue a practice of imposing punishment 
unjustly.” 
 
CURRENT LAW: NON-UNION EMPLOYEES  
A representative may be present where the employer allows for such. 
 
No longer must an employer allow a representative to be present where an employee 
specifically requests representation. However, an employer is not precluded from allowing 
the employee to have representation upon request. 
 
Employers can always decide not to conduct an interview, but refusing to do so may cause 
problems of its own. If the company administers disciplinary action without first hearing the 
employee’s side of the story, then the company may be handing the employee a lawsuit for 
wrongful discharge or a discrimination claim. As a general rule, it is difficult to defend a 
termination action if the employer did not at least listen to the employee’s version of events 
prior to taking action. 
 
Where the employer allows for employee representation, the employer need not “bargain 
with” the employee’s representative.  
 
Presumably, the ruling in Weingarten will continue to control this issue. In Weingarten, the 
Supreme Court stated that the representative’s role is to assist the employee, and he “may do 
so by attempting to clarify facts or suggest other employees who may have knowledge of 
them.” The Court made it clear that the employer may insist on hearing the subject’s version 
of events, and the representative is not allowed to direct the subject not to answer a question 
or to tell the subject to answer questions only once. Therefore, the employer is allowed to 
conduct the interview without interference by the representative. 
 
Employees do not have a right to be represented at an interview by a private attorney.  
 
Under Epilepsy, where an employer failed to comply with the rules requiring representation 
upon employee request, it could have been subjected to an administrative cease-and-desist 
Law  Individual Rights During Examinations 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.413 
order and/or reinstatement of the employee with back pay. Due to the overturning of 
Epilepsy and reinstatement of Weingarten, however, these penalties will probably not apply 
unless the non-union employer agrees to allow employee representation. 
 
If an employee requests any type of representation at an interview, you should immediately 
consult your legal counsel. You should also consult counsel to review your existing policies 
and procedures to ensure that you are aware of the legal duties, ramifications, and remedies 
surrounding employee representation. 
 
Nondiscrimination Statutes 
Included in the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1871, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1970, is the prohibition of singling out 
employees for interviews based on their race, national origin, religion, sex, or age. 
 
Fair Labor Standards 
The Fair Labor Standards require an employer to pay an employee for time spent in an 
interview. 
 
Common Law Protection in Connection with Interviews  
Even though employees of private organizations do not, in most cases, enjoy constitutional 
protections in connection with interviews, they do have certain protections that arise out of 
common law. These protections also apply to employees of public organizations. Fraud 
examiners must be aware of the relevant common-law protections that relate to internal 
interviews and must be careful not to expose themselves to legal liability. 
 
Invasion of Privacy 
While modern tort law includes four categories of invasion of privacy, this discussion only 
addresses the two most common forms of invasion of privacy applicable to fraud 
examinations: intrusion upon seclusion and public disclosure of private facts. 
 
INTRUSION INTO SECLUSION 
Intrusion upon seclusion occurs when an individual intentionally intrudes “upon the solitude 
or seclusion of another or his private affairs or concerns” and “the intrusion would be highly 
offensive to a reasonable person.” Questioning employees about activities not related to job 
performance might constitute an invasion of privacy. 
 
Individual Rights During Examinations Law 
2.414  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
The elements of this tort include:  
• An intentional intrusion 
• Into an area where an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy 
• The intrusion would be highly offensive or objectionable to a reasonable person  
 
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE FACTS 
The tort of public disclosure of private facts occurs when one party makes public statements 
about another party’s private life that are not of public concern. For instance, disclosing 
information obtained in an interview to individuals not involved in the investigation. 
 
Unlike defamation claims, which are discussed below, this cause of action can arise even if 
the statements are true. The key is that the information is private in nature and it is not a 
matter of public interest. 
 
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress 
Intentional infliction of emotional distress refers to any unprivileged conduct that is so 
outrageous and egregious that it exceeds all bounds usually tolerated by civilized society and 
that is intended to cause injury (or was committed with reckless disregard for the likelihood 
of its causing injury) to another.  
 
For an employee to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, he must 
establish all of the following elements: 
• The employer engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct 
• The employer’s conduct was intended to cause severe emotional distress (or, if not 
intended, would cause severe emotional distress in a reasonable person) 
• The employee actually did suffer emotional or mental distress as a result of the 
employer’s conduct 
 
It is not enough that the employee is merely “upset” by the conduct. For example, 
questioning alone, even coupled with accusations and raised voices, probably will not give 
rise to such a claim. 
 
Defamation 
Defamation is an unprivileged publication of a falsehood about a person that tends to harm 
the reputation of that person. The law of defamation actually consists of two torts: libel and 
slander. Libel is basically defamation that appears in written form, while slander involves 
Law  Individual Rights During Examinations 
2011 Fraud Examiners Manual    2.415 
defamatory remarks that are only spoken. 
 
In general, the elements of these two causes of action are essentially the same. To recover 
for defamation, the plaintiff must prove the following elements:  
• The defendant made an untrue statement of fact 
• The statement was communicated (published) to third parties 
• The statement was made on an unprivileged occasion 
• The statement damaged the subject’s reputation 
 
The threat of a defamation lawsuit is always present when allegations of wrongdoing are 
made against certain employees. For example, a claim of defamation might arise in the 
context of an interview as a result of unfounded accusations or statements made by the 
interviewer, where someone in addition to the employee and the interviewer is present. 
 
Assuming that an employee can establish that defamatory statements were made and 
communicated to a third-party, the most important defense to a defamation action for fraud 
examiners is that of qualified business privilege. If this privilege applies, then no liability can 
attach to the speaker.  
 
The qualified business privilege generally applies if a person makes a statement (1) in good 
faith; (2) regarding a subject in which the person making the statement has a legitimate 
interest or duty; and (3) to those who have an interest in the matter.  
 
The privilege, however, might be lost if the defamatory statements are communicated with 
“malice.” This usually means that the person communicating the statements knew they were 
false or made them without regard to whether they were false. 
 
Some courts have held that there can be no defamation arising from an employer’s inquiries 
of its employees concerning their possible involvement in a violation of company policy. 
The employer might even have duty to investigate, arising from its duty to protect its 
business, its employees, and the public from wrongdoing employees. 
 
Good Faith and Fair Dealing 
Several states recognize a duty on the part of employers to deal with their employees fairly 
and in good faith. This duty might include abiding by all provisions in an employee 
handbook. For example, it might contain a provision that interviews will be conducted in a 
Individual Rights During Examinations Law 
2.416  2011 Fraud Examiners Manual  
professional manner and only concerning job related matters. 
 
Breach of Implied Contract 
Employers and employees may enter into contracts that govern the length and terms of 
employment, and if the employer violates the contract, the employee can sue for breach of 
contract. 
 
Moreover, employment contracts can be express or implied. Just because the company has 
not signed a written, formalized contract with an employee, this does not mean that there is 
no employment contract. Collective-bargaining agreements, employee handbooks, and even 
oral promises can establish an employment contract and limit the company’s ability to 
discipline or fire an employee. Before taking any disciplinary action against an employee, 
make sure you are aware of the true status of the employment relationship.  
 
False Imprisonment 
False imprisonment is restraint by one person of the physical liberty of another without consent 
or legal justification. A claim of false imprisonment might be made if an employee is 
detained in any way during a search either of the employee or of the employee’s desk, locker, 
etc. Generally, an employer is entitled to question an employee at work about a violation of 
company policy without incurring liability as long as the employee submits to the 
questioning voluntarily; that is, not as a result of threats or force. However, the length, 
nature, and manner of the interview will determine whether liability arises. 
 
False imprisonment factors include: 
• Size and nature of the room where an interview takes place (small, windowless, not easily 
accessible is a negative) 
• Lighting in room—soft versus severe 
• Requiring the employee’s presence or continued presence by any amount of force, 
including holding the employee’s arm to escort him 
• Violent behavior of any kind during the in terview, including yelling, pounding on desks, 
or kicking furniture or walls 
• Refusing to allow the employee to leave the room, such as by pushing the employee into 
a chair or locking the door 
• The number of people involved in the interview
