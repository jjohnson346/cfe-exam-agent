Breach of Implied Contract 
Employers and employees may enter into contracts that govern the length and terms of 
employment, and if the employer violates the contract, the employee can sue for breach of 
contract. 
 
Moreover, employment contracts can be express or implied. Just because the company has 
not signed a written, formalized contract with an employee, this does not mean that there is 
no employment contract. Collective-bargaining agreements, employee handbooks, and even 
oral promises can establish an employment contract and limit the company’s ability to 
discipline or fire an employee. Before taking any disciplinary action against an employee, 
make sure you are aware of the true status of the employment relationship.
