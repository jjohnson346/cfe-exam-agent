Explanation=All employees should sign a nondisclosure agreement. Everyone involved with the company should sign such an agreement, including subcontractors and their employees, clerical staff, consultants, and temporaries. Besides the legal value, a comprehensive nondisclosure agreement sends a signal to employees that the company has a tough attitude toward preventing leaks. It might also be necessary to have suppliers and distributors sign nondisclosure agreements.
