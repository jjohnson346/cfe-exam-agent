Section=Theft of Intellectual Property

Stem=Research and development personnel often inadvertently divulge confidential information through which of the following?

Options=Articles written for industry journals | Hiring outside academic professionals | Discussions with colleagues at conferences | All of the above

CorrectResponse=3

Explanation=One would think that research and development would be the most heavily guarded department in a company, but access to research and development information is surprisingly easy. Research and development personnel are almost always in the flow of information. The open exchange of information is part of the nature of their job. They participate in conferences, attend trade shows, and work with academic institutions; however, at each of these functions, they leave themselves open for intelligence spies to listen, mingle, and ask questions. Researchers who publish their findings in industry journals may inadvertently include details of a project on which they are working. This is particularly true in the case of academic professionals hired by a company to perform research or conduct a study. More than one company has been surprised to leam that the results of a supposedly confidential study were published in an academic journal. If an academician is hired to conduct research, make sure that he understands that the results are to be kept confidential. Also make sure that the use of teaching assistants or graduate students is kept to a minimum and that those individuals understand the confidentiality requirements.See page(s) 1.821 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
