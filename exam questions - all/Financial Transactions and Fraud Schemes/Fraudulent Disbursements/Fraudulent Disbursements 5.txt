Explanation=The altered payee scheme is a type of check tampering fraud in which an employee intercepts a company check intended for a third party and alters the payee designation so that the check can be converted by the employee or an accomplice. The fraudster inserts his own name, the name of a fictitious entity, or some other name on the payee line of the check.See page(s) 136-138 in the Corporate Fraud Handbook
