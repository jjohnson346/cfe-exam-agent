Explanation=One major form of billing fraud is the personal purchases scheme. Instead of undertaking billing schemes to generate cash, many fraudsters simply purchase personal items with their companyâ€™s money. Company accounts are used to buy items for fraudsters, their businesses, their families, and so on. Most of the employees in our study who undertook purchases schemes did so by running unsanctioned invoices through the accounts payable system. The fraudster in this type of scheme buys an item and submits the bill to his employer as if it represented a purchase on behalf of the company. The goal is to have the company pay the invoice.See page(s) 196. 199-200 in the Corporate Fraud Handbook
