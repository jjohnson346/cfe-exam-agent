Explanation=According to Government Auditing Standards' Reporting Standards for Performance Audits, auditors should report known or likely fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or abuse directly to parties outside the audited entity in the following two circumstances, a. When entity management fails to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements to report such information to external parties specified in lav/ or regulation, auditors should first communicate the failure to report such information to those charged with governance. If the audited entity still does not report this information to the specified external parties as soon as practicable after the auditors’ communication with those charged with governance, then the auditors should report the information directly to the specified external parties, b. When entity management fails to take timely and appropriate steps to respond to known or likely fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or abuse that (1) is significant to the findings and conclusions, and (2) involves funding received directly or indirectly from a government agency, auditors should first report management’s failure to take timely and appropriate steps to those charged with governance. If the audited entity still does not take timely and appropriate steps as soon as practicable after the auditors' communication with those charged with governance, then the auditors should report the entity’s failure to take timely and appropriate steps directly to the funding agency.See page(s) 1.1910-1.1911 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
