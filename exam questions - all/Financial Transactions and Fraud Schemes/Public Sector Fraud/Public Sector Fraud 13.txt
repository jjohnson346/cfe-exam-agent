Explanation=Under Title 18, U.S. Code. Section 1001, a false statement can be oral, written, sworn or unsworn, and signed or unsigned.

Concealment by failure to fully disclose required information is also a violation. The statement need not be made directly to the government; it can be made to a third party as long as it involves a matter within the jurisdiction of any governmental department or agency. The statement must be material, but there is no requirement that the government suffer an actual loss. The materiality of the false statement is judged by the capability of the statement to influence government action.See page(s) 1.1912 in the Fraud Examinerâ€™s Manual
