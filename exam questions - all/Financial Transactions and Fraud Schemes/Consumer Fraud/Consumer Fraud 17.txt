Explanation=One reason that pyramid schemes continue to flourish could be that familiarity has lulled the public into a false sense of security. Pyramiders have several strong v/eapons at their disposal:
•	They do pay off. Unlike a simple con game—which throws the ruse, grabs the cash, and exits—pyramiding builds up the take by paying initial investors. This makes for excellent testimonials. Early players circulate the word and bring in new marks. Initial payoffs also keep early players coming back. Payoffs make the enterprise look legitimate, and fuel the expansion process. Charles Phillip Elliot ran his investment business pyramid-style for 16 years, taking in more than S60 million from 1,100 investors. When Elliot was busted, a business associate quipped, “Elliot paid like a slot machine. He lulled everyone to sleep."
•	They operate mainly through pre-existing affiliations. Community groups, religious organizations, and social clubs all make enticing targets for pyramiders. Any pyramid requires a healthy pool of participants, so a large group already gathered together is ideal. Besides that, pyramiders know how to manipulate the trust that people place ^ i
