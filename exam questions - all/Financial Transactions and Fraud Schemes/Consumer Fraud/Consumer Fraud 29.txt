Explanation=Terms in the telemarketerâ€™s vocabulary include banging, or nailing, the customer (i.e., closing the deal), and the following:â€¢	Boiler room staffâ€”Work in a boiler room is shared by fronters, closers and verifiers.â€¢	Frontersâ€”The fronter calls victims and makes the initial pitch. This low-level worker is usually breaking into the business and reads from a script to the prospective customer. Fronters seldom see the merchandise or know the full extent of the operation. Keeping fronters in the dark, at least in theory, limits what they can tell investigators and protects them in the event of prosecution.â€¢	Closersâ€”The closer is a veteran. Fronters pass an interested caller to their closer, identified as the firm's "manager,â€? who convinces the person to buy.â€¢	Verifiersâ€”Next, the caller is passed to a verifier, who reads some vague words about the deal and records the personâ€™s agreement. These recordings are intentionally vague, leaving out the pitch and key details, essentially recording only the customer's consent. Verifiers also stall customers who call back to complain (heat calls),flnriinn	o IiHIa m n rn	u/ill aaIha	nrnKlnm onrJ in r a m a aaoat AAnuinAmn fhn AArr An â™¦ a rnnrl a liHln m a rn mnnnu â™¦ a hnln il">n nr a aaa a o Inn nSee page(s) 1.1709-1.1710 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
