Explanation=The difference between a Ponzi and a pyramid lies in how the operation is promoted. Illegal pyramids are promoted as pyramids. Ponzi schemes are promoted as investment opportunities. Illegal pyramids announce themselves as pyramids: they hype levels or stages in their literature. The pyramidal structure helps draw new players, each believing that he will rise through the ranks of the pyramid to become ' golden," or â€œfully vestedâ€?â€”whatever hokey titles the scammers have concocted. A Ponzi scheme, on the other hand, masquerades as some type of investmentâ€”in financial instruments, mineral rights, or some other form of speculation. The participants believe theyâ€™re buying mortgage-backed securities, or partial interest in an oil well. They have no idea they're funneling money into a bottomless pit. Certainly no one suggests moving on to the next level of the pyramid, because the pyramid isnâ€™t part of the pitch.See page(s) 1.1742 in the Fraud Examinerâ€™s Manual
