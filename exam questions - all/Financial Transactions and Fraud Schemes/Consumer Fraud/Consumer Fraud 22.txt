Explanation=The simplest credit scam promises that the company will secure a loan for the applicant, regardless of credit history and references, if the person pays an upfront fee, usually between $35 and S75. Checking account debits are a favorite payment method, as are 900 numbers that charge by the minute (up to S40 or $50 per call) to hear information that is widely available and provides no help in swaying a loan for the listener Usually there are few or no loans made.
