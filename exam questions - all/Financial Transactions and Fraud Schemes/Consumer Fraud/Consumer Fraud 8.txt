Explanation=Telemarketing offenses are classified as consumer fraud, yet many businesses are affected by office supply and marketing services scams. The hit-and-run nature of phone rooms, the geographical distances between the crooks and their victims, and the resources and priorities of lav/ enforcement agencies all make enforcement efforts difficult. Only about one in 100 victims ever files a complaint.
