Explanation=Unscrupulous debt consolidation schemes often involve the agency collecting the money from the debtor but not forwarding it to the creditors. In some instances, considerable time can pass before the debtor finds out that his money has been misappropriated. Another variation of the debt consolidation scheme occurs when a customer is “guaranteed" that he will receive a loan or a credit card regardless of his credit ratings. Typically, the victims have been rejected by legitimate financial institutions because their credit ratings are poor. The victim must pay a processing fee for the application to be accepted. After the victim pays the fee, the con artist disappears.
