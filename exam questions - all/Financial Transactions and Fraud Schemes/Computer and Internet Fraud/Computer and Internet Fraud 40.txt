Stem=All but which of the following are anti-hacker measures?

Options=Communication software that disconnects after no less than ten unsuccessful attempts | Encryption for sensitive data files | Changing default passv/ords on purchased software packages | Passwords of sufficient length to prevent "guessing"

CorrectResponse=0

Explanation=The following are some anti-hacking preventative measures that can be implemented:•	Passv/ords should be of sufficient length to deter "guessing."•	Most purchased software comes with a vendor supplied password that is used for installation and then deleted. All packages should be audited to ensure that these default passwords (which are widely known) have been changed.•	Encryption should be considered for sensitive data files, password files, and sensitive computer programs.•	Communications software should terminate any connection (whether dial-in or direct connect) after a reasonable number of unsuccessful attempts to enter a valid password (usually no more than three).See page(s) 1.1811-1.1813 in the Fraud Examiner’s Manual
