Explanation=Receipt schemes are what we typically think of as the outright stealing of cash. The perpetrator does not rely on the submission of phony documents or the forging of signatures: he simply grabs the cash and takes it. The theft schemes fall into two categories: skimming and larceny schemes. Skimming is defined as the theft of off-book funds. Cash larceny schemes, however, involve the theft of money that has already appeared on a victim companyâ€™s books.See page(s) 100 in the Corporate Fraud Handbook
