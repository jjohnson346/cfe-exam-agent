Explanation=According to Marshall and McManus, "intangible assets" are "long-lived assets that differ from property, plant, and equipment that has been purchased outright or acquired under a capital leaseâ€”either because the asset is represented by a contractual right, or because the asset results from a purchase transaction but is not physically identifiable. Examples of the first type of intangible assets are leaseholds, patents, and trademarks; the second type of asset is known as goodwill."See page(s) 51 in the Corporate Fraud Handbook
