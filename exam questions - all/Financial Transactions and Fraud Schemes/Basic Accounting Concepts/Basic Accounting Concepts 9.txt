Explanation=By "conservatism," accountants mean that the financial figures presented by the company are at least as much as reflected in the statements, if not more. There is a saying in accounting: "Anticipate possible losses and omit potential profits." This results in asymmetrical accounting, where the expenses purposefully are overstated and the revenues purposefully are understated.See page(s) 331-332 in the Corporate Fraud Handbook
