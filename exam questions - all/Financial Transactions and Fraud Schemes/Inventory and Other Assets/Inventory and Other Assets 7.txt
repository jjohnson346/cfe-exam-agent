Explanation=The fake sale is one form of inventory larceny specifically discussed in Corporate Fraud Handbook. Asset misappropriations are not always undertaken solely by employees of the victim company. In many cases, corrupt employees utilize outside accomplices to help steal inventory. The fake sale is one method that depends upon an accomplice for its success. Like most inventory thefts, the fake sale is not difficult. A fake sale occurs when the accomplice of the employee-fraudster â€œbuys" merchandise, but the employee does not ring up the sale, and the accomplice takes the merchandise without making any payment.See page(s) 255 in the Corporate Fraud Handbook
