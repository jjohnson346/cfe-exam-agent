Such duties include securing the business location, changing locks, locating assets of the estate, locating business records, opening new bank accounts, investigating thefts of assets in conjunction with the trustee, storing assets of the estate, and arranging sales of assets. Adjusters also can assist debtors and trustees in operating the debtor's business and in helping to prepare bankruptcy schedules, interim statements, and operating reports.See page(s) 1.1304 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
