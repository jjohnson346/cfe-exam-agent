Explanation=Property flipping is the process by which an investor purchases a home, and then resells it at a higher price shortly thereafter. For example, an investor buys a house in need of work for $250,000 in July, renovates the kitchen and bathrooms, and landscapes the yard at a cost of S50,000, and then resells the house 2 months later (the time it takes to make the renovations) for a price that is reflective of the market for a house in that condition. This is a legitimate business transaction, and there are numerous individuals and groups in the real estate market who make an honest living flipping properties. Property flipping becomes illegal and fraudulent when a home is purchased and resold within a short period of time at an artificially inflated value.See page(s) 1.923 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
