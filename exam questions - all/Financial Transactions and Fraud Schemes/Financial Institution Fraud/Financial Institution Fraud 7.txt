Explanation=x INCORRECTFraud schemes resulting in a nonperforming loan include:•	Fraudulent appraisals—The cash flow cannot support an inflated loan and, therefore, debt amount.•	False statements—The loan was made on false or fraudulently presented assumptions.•	Equity skimming—There was never any intention to make the underlying loan payments.•	Construction over budget Items—The over budget amount might be a concealment method for other schemes such as embezzlement, misappropriation, or false statements.•	Bribery—The loan was made because the lender received a bribe or a kickback from the borrower.•	Land flips—The purpose of the loan was to finance the seller out of a property which has an artificially inflated value.•	Disguised transactions—Transactions that are sham transactions, without substance, made to conceal other ills.See page(s) 1.908-1.909 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
