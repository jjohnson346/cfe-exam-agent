Explanation=White-collar defendants receive bail rather easily: just one person in eight spends any time incarcerated before trial, and for the generally high-status antitrust defendants, the figure is fewer than one in 20. By comparison, in a control group of “common criminals'—i.e., people convicted of the "nonviolent economic crimes" of postal theft or postal fraud—at least 1/3 of the defendants spent time in jail before going to trial.See page(s) 4.411 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
