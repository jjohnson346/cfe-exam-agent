Explanation=What is loosely called â€˜ classâ€™â€™ or â€œsocial statusâ€? does have an effect on crimes.

The loans would never have been approved without the chairmanâ€™s influence, and he never reported them in his proxy statement to the bankâ€™s shareholders.See page(s) 4.407 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
