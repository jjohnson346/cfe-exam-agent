Explanation=Donald R. Cressey found in a 1953 study of embezzlers that most of those he examined â€œhad lived beyond their means for some time before deciding to embezzle.â€? Later authors have extended this statement more generally, remarking, â€œThe most interesting fact about the white-collar offendersâ€™ aggregate financial status is not the value of their assets but the extent of their liabilities." Offenders often â€œhave the material goods associated with successful people but may barely be holding their financial selves together.â€? These people have assembled a structure of respectability, but it is often built on the sands of debt.See page(s) 4.407 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
