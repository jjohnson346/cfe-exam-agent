Explanation=Less is often more when it comes to reporting the results of the fraud risk assessment. The team should take care not to turn the report into a laundry list of things that management will have to sort through and prioritize. Instead, the report should be presented in a v/ay that focuses on what really matters, clearly highlighting those things that are most important and that will make the most impact to the organization's fraud risk management efforts.See page(s) 4.823 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
