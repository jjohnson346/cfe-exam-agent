Explanation=Essentially, control theory argues that the institutions of the social system train and press those with whom they are in contact into patterns of conformity. Schools train for adjustment in society, peers press the ethos of success and conventional behavior, and parents strive to inculcate law-abiding habits in their youngsters even, Hirschi stresses, parents who themselves play fast and loose with the rules. The theory rests on the thesis that to the extent a person fails to become attached to the variety of control agencies of the society, his or her chances of violating the law are increased. This doctrine edges very close to being self-evident in its insistence that close affiliation with law-abiding people, groups, and organizations is predictive of law-abiding behavior, but it is notably rich with subordinate statements, some of them far from obvious.See page(s) 4.209 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
