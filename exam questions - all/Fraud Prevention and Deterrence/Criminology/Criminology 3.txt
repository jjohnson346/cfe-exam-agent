Explanation=Behavioral studies, such as those conducted by Skinner, show that punishment is the least effective method of changing behavior. Punishing brings "a temporary suppression of the behavior,â€? but only with constant supervision and application. In repeated experiments, Skinner found that punishmentâ€”either applying a negative stimulus, or taking away a positive oneâ€”effectively extinguished a subject's behavior, but that the behavior returned â€œwhen the punishment was discontinued ... and eventually all responses came out" again.See page(s) 4.102 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
