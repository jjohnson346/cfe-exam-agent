Stem=Efforts to control corporate crime generally follow three approaches. Which of the following is NOT one of those approaches?

Options=Strong intervention of the government to force changes | Allowing minor violations if no one is harmed | Voluntary changes in corporate attitudes and structure | Consumer action to force change

CorrectResponse=1

Explanation=Efforts to control corporate crime follow three approaches: voluntary change in corporate attitudes and structure; strong intervention of the political state to force changes in corporate structure, accompanied by legal measures to deter or punish; or consumer action. Voluntary changes would involve the development of stronger business ethics and certain corporate organizational reforms; government controls might involve federal corporate chartering, deconcentration and divesture, larger and more effective enforcement staffs, stiffer penalties, wider use of publicity as a sanction, and possibly the nationalization of corporations; and consumer group pressures may be exerted through lobbying, selective buying, boycotts, and the establishment of large consumer cooperatives.See page(s) 4.513 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
