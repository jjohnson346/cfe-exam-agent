Stem=Efforts to control corporate crime follow three approaches. Which of the following is/are included?

Options=Consumer action | State intervention | Voluntary changes in corporate attitudes | All of the above are approaches

CorrectResponse=3

Explanation=Efforts to control corporate crime follow three approaches: voluntary change in corporate attitudes and structure; strong intervention by the state to force changes in corporate structure, accompanied by legal measures to deter or punish; or consumer action. Voluntary changes would involve the development of stronger business ethics and organizational reforms. Government controls may involve federal corporate chartering, deconcentration and divestiture, larger and more effective enforcement staffs, stiffer penalties, wider use of publicity as a sanction, and possibly the nationalization of corporations. Consumer group pressures may be exerted through lobbying, selective buying, boycotts, and the establishment of large consumer cooperatives.See page(s) 4.513 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
