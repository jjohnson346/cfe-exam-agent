Explanation=x Most experts agree that it is much easier to prevent than detect fraud. To prevent fraud, the fraud examiner should understand something about the mind of the potential perpetrator. Increasing the perception of detection might be the most effective fraud prevention method. Controls, for example, do little good in forestalling theft and fraud if those at risk do not know of the presence of possible detection.See page(s) 4.720 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
