Explanation=The Federal Sentencing Guidelines require an organization to consider the following factors when designing an effective compliance and ethics program:•	Applicable industry size and practice—An organization’s failure to incorporate and follow industry practice or the standards called for by any applicable government regulation weighs against a finding that the program is effective.•	Size of the organization—Large organizations are expected to devote more formal operations and greater resources to meeting the requirements than are small organizations. For example, smaller organizations may use available personnel rather than employ separate staff to carry out ethics and compliance•	Recurrence of similar misconduct—The recurrence of a similar event creates doubt as to whether the organization took reasonable steps to meet the requirements.See page(s) 4.709 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
