Explanation=in my opinion, thisFraud examiners must always perform their work with skepticism, beginning with the belief that something is v/rong or someone is committing a fraud. This attitude may make fraud examinations extensive and expensive. Opinions or attestations of a fraud-free environment are prohibited for Certified Fraud Examiners.
