Explanation=Why does an individual or a group need a code of ethical conduct? While it has been said that a person should be upright and not be kept upright, a code of conduct serves a useful purpose as a reference and a benchmark. A code makes explicit some of the criteria for conduct particular to a profession. In this way, codes of professional ethics are able to provide some direct solutions that might not be available from general ethics theories. Furthermore, an individual is better able to know what the profession expects when a code of ethical conduct is in place. From the viewpoint of an organized profession, a code is a public declaration of principled conduct and a means of facilitating enforcement of standards of conduct. Practical enforcement and profession-wide internal discipline would be much more difficult if members were not first put on notice of the standards.See page(s) 4.901-4.902 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
