Options=New information | Myopic vision | Opposing view theory | None of the above

CorrectResponse=1

Explanation="Myopic vision" entails getting the expert to admit excessive time being spent in the investigation of the matter then selecting an area to highlight of which the expert is unsure or has not done much work. This area may not be central to the issues in the case or to conclusions reached. Then, the opposing counsel will make a large issue of it and prove that the expert's vision is myopic in that the work was limited in extent or scope, and as such, substandard.See page(s) 2.822 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
