Explanation=According to discovery rules governing expert testimony, everything the expert says or writes about the case after being hired is subject to discovery by opposing counsel. That means everything: narrative versions of the case, comments to the press or law enforcement, hypothetical reconstructions, even notes can be demanded and used by the opposing party A shrewd attorney can use an expert’s notebook—which contains “dry runs" at an opinion and other purely deliberative information—to call the witness’s testimony into question. The only exception is when the expert is hired by the attorney purely on a consulting basis.See page(s) 2.807-2.808 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
