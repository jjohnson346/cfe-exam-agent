Section=Testifying as an Expert Witness

Stem=The notes and materials of an expert, hired to testify on behalf of a client, are generally privileged from discovery.

Explanation=According to discovery rules governing expert testimony, everything the expert says or writes about the case after being hired is subject to discovery by opposing counsel. That means everything: narrative versions of the case, comments to the press or law enforcement, hypothetical reconstructions, even notes can be demanded and used by the opposing party. A shrewd attorney can use an expertâ€™s notebookâ€”which contains â€œdry runsâ€? at an opinion and other purely deliberative informationâ€”to call the witness's testimony into question. The only exception is when the expert is hired by the attorney purely on a consulting basis. In legalese, an expert witness has no privilege. The principle of privilege exists to protect certain core societal relationships (attorney-client, husband-wife), but the expert witnessâ€™ relationship with clients is not among those protected. If the expertâ€™s opinions will be presented in court, everything related to the expert's opinion is discoverable.See page(s) 2.807-2.808 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
