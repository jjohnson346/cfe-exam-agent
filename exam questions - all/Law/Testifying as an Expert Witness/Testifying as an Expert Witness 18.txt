Section=Testifying as an Expert Witness

Stem=Bailey, a Certified Fraud Examiner, is being cross-examined in court on his expert opinion relating to a fraud matter Darwin, a defense attorney, is attempting to trap Bailey on a number of "what if" scenarios which would cause a distortion of Bailey's opinion. What should Bailey do?

Options=Point out to Darwin that he is not being fair | Object and refuse to answer | Ask that the question be rephrased | Any of the above

CorrectResponse=2

Explanation=Generally, it is a rule of thumb that free information should not be given away or volunteered. During the answer, it often might be extremely difficult to avoid getting trapped in various assumptions, â€œwhat if scenarios, and generalities presented by counsel during cross-examination. If this occurs, retrench by asking for a question to be rephrased in smaller components.See page(s) 2.821 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
