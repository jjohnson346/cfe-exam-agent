Options=Reputation | Skill | Education | Experience

CorrectResponse=0

Explanation=Under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, a witness qualified as an expert by â€œknowledge, skill, experience, training or education' may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise to â€˜scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge" if such testimony will â€œassist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine the fact in issue.â€? The determination of whether a witness is qualified as an expert or whether expert testimony is needed is left to the discretion of the trial judge. There is no particular educational requirement for expert testimony; a witness with no formal education may be qualified based on training or experience.See page(s) 2.811-2.812 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
