Section=Criminal Prosecutions for Fraud

Stem=Which of the following are valid reasons for the defendant to file a motion to dismiss an indictment in a criminal trial?

Options=Failure to provide a speedy trial | Double jeopardy | Selective prosecution | All of the above

CorrectResponse=3

Explanation=There are several grounds upon which a defendant may request that an indictment be dismissed. They include:•	Violations of a defendant’s right to speedy trial.•	Selective prosecution. The defense accuses the authorities of targeting some individuals and exonerating others without cause.•	Double jeopardy, which prevents someone from being tried for the same crime twice•	Challenging the sufficiency of the indictment. If the indictment does not include all the essential elements of the crimes charged, then the defense can challenge it.•	Duplicity. Each count of an indictment must state one and only one offense.•	Multiplicity. When two or more counts charge essentially the same offense; thereby exposing the defendant to cumulative punishment for one offense.See page(s) 2.512-2.513 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
