Explanation=A defendant can plead nolo contendere only with permission of the court. If accepted, a nolo plea is the same as a plea of guilty for purposes of punishment, but cannot be used as a formal admission of guilt. Nolo contendere is a favored plea for corporate defendants who are facing subsequent civil litigation.See page(s) 2.508 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
