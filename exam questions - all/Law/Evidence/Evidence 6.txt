Explanation=Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence defines relevant evidence as evidence “having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” In other words, relevant evidence is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a fact in issue.
