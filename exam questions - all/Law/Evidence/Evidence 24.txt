Explanation=Business and government records are technically hearsay because theyâ€™re prepared outside the courtroom. However, a special exception for these materials makes them admissible if they are provided with a legal foundation. The admissibility of records rests on two criteria: have they been prepared during â€œregularly conducted business activity?â€? and are they verifiably trustworthy? Materials prepared specifically for trial are not admissible as business records. Anything which casts doubt on the veracity of these documents can bar them. In situations where the charge involves altered documents, the materials are admitted to prove the charge of alterationâ€”not for their truth valueâ€”so the hearsay rule doesnâ€™t apply.See page(s) 2.719-2.720 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
