Explanation=At the most basic level, the evidence must be established as reliable. If a piece of real evidence can't be authenticatedâ€”as to who owned and used the item, for exampleâ€”the evidence wonâ€™t be admitted, even if itâ€™s plainly relevant. There is a similar sort of â€˜credibility testâ€? for witnesses. If testimony is to become admissible evidence, the witness has to demonstrate that the knowledge being communicated is believable and was gained by personal experience.See page(s) 2.707 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
