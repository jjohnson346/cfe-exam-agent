Explanation=The adversary testimony privilege protects spouses from being compelled to testify against each other v/hile they are married. This privilege does not usually continue past the termination of the marriage. There is no privilege that permits a person not to testify against other family members, although, as a matter of policy, many lav/ enforcement agencies will not compel testimony from immediate family members.See page(s) 2.731-2.732 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
