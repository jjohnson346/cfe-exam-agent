Explanation=Civil actions to recover damages for fraud or to enjoin further fraudulent activity can be filed by private plaintiffs in state or federal courts. Most common-law fraud actions, usually styled misrepresentation claims, are filed in state courts. Federal court generally is preferred by plaintiffs in larger civil cases because of the easier access to witnesses and documents located in different states, which the federal rules provide. One drawback of federal courts, however, is that it usually takes longer for a case to go to trial in federal court.See page(s) 2.601 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
