Explanation=An illegal gratuity charge does not require proof of intent to influence. The statute prohibits a public official from accepting any payment of money or other thing of value other than his lav/ful compensation. In practice, the statute often is applied when relatively small payments, such as gifts or entertainment, are used to attempt to influence a public official.See page(s) 2.206-2.207 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
