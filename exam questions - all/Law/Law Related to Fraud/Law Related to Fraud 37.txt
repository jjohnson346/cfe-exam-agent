Options=The defendant mistakenly provides incorrect information | The defendant knew the information was untrue | The plaintiff was deceived by misleading information | None of the above

CorrectResponse=1

Explanation=A statement is false for the purposes of Section 1001 if it was known to be untrue when it was made, and is fraudulent if it was known to be untrue and was made with the intent to deceive a government agency. For a violation to occur, the agency need not actually have been deceived nor must the agency have in fact relied upon the false statement. The statement must have been capable, however, of influencing the agency involved.See page(s) 2.238 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
