Section=Legal Rights of Employees

Stem=Employees could claim that they have a reasonable expectation of privacy if:

Options=They are not informed that their desks and lockers could be searched | They are allowed to store their personal belongings in their desks | There have never been any searches of desks or lockers | All of the above

CorrectResponse=3

Explanation=To lower the expectation of privacy and to preserve the right to search any and all areas, the employer should adopt a written policy which provides that in order to maintain the security of its operations, the company might gain access to and search all work areas and personal belongings, including desks, file drawers, lockers, briefcases, handbags, pockets, and personal effects. Include in the policy that workplace areas are subject to surveillance and that business phone calls might be monitored. And the policy also should state that the employer can monitor all electronic communications, such as e-mail, as well as monitor what sites are visited over the Internet.See page(s) 2.420-2.421 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
