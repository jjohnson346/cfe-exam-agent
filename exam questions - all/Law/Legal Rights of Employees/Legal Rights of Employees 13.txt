Explanation=Under the exclusionary rule in effect in all federal and state courts, evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment will be suppressed; that is. it may not be used against the accused, with limited exceptions. An unlawful search and seizure, however, does not preclude prosecution or invalidate a subsequent conviction based on other evidence. A person whose Fourth Amendment rights have been violated, whether or not a defendant in a criminal case, may sue for damages through a private civil rights action.See page(s) 2.431 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
