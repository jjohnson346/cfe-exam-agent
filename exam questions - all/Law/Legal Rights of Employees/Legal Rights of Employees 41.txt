Explanation=In Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967). the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment applies wherever there is a "reasonable expectation of privacy.'’ and that a search without a warrant is “per se unreasonable," absent exigent circumstances. Thus, the police normally need to obtain a warrant not only to search a house, but also to intercept calls from a public telephone booth, or inspect the contents of a safe deposit box, or to otherwise intrude into matters which the courts would reasonably consider to be private.See page(s) 2.417-2.418 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
