Options=IBC may be in violation of the 4th Amendment because it is acting at the request of the government | IBC cannot be guilty of violating the 4th Amendment because it is not a government agency | IBC could not be in violation of the 4th Amendment because it is a private company; however, it may be subject to civil liability | IBC's actions would be private action, not state action; therefore, the 4th Amendment would not apply

Explanation=In order for an employee to sue an employer for the violation of a constitutional right, there must be some form of "state action" involved. State action is involved during any investigation by a state or federal entity, including investigations of their own employees. There are no bright-line rules regarding when an investigation can be considered to involve state action. However, the following examples could be considered to involve state action:•	Investigations conducted by a private company but at the suggestion of the state or federal authorities•	Investigations begun by a private company that later are taken over by or expanded by state or federal authorities•	Joint investigations with or aided by state or federal authorities•	Investigations conducted by a private company that are required by state or federal law•	Searches or interrogations conducted by outside investigators who are off-duty state, local or federal authoritiesSee page(s) 2.403 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
