Explanation=Katz v. United States, 389 US 347 (1967), is probably the most important of the Supreme Court's Fourth Amendment decisions. The Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment â€œprotects people, not places" (meaning that its provisions extend beyond the property line of the citizen), that the amendment applies wherever there is a â€œreasonable expectation of privacy,â€? and that a search without a warrant is â€œper se unreasonable," absent exigent circumstances. Thus, the police normally need to obtain a warrant not only to search a house, but also to intercept calls from a public telephone booth, or inspect the contents of a safe deposit box, or to otherwise intrude into matters which the courts would reasonably consider to be private. The duty of police to inform a suspect of his right to counsel is a Sixth Amendment issue, not a Fourth Amendment issue.See page(s) 2.417 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
