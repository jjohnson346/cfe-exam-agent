Explanation=From the moment evidence is received, its chain of custody must be maintained for it to be accepted by the court. This means that a record must be made when the item is received or when it leaves the care, custody, or control of the fraud examiner. This is best handled by a memorandum of interview with the custodian of the records when the evidence is received.See page(s) 3.101 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
