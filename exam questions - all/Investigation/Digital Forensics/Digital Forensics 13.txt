Options=True | False

CorrectResponse=0

Explanation=The proper handling of digital evidence is critical; it is easily altered or destroyed if handled improperly. The destruction of digital evidence through improper handling can result in a finding of spoliation of evidence by a judge or can raise questions about the alteration of exculpatory evidence by the defense. If a judge determines that the authenticity of the evidence cannot be satisfactorily made, then he may rule that the evidence is inadmissible.See page(s) 3.702 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
