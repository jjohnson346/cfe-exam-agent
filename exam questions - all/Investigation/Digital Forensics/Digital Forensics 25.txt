Explanation=A computer-forensic examiner is a trained professional who is capable of analyzing digital media at the hexadecimal level. The hexadecimal level means that every sector and all the bytes in those sectors are available for viev/ing. This includes deleted files, both purposefully deleted and those that v/ere deleted through various Windows-automated processes. This can also include temporary auto-save files, print-spool files, deleted e-mails, and link files.
