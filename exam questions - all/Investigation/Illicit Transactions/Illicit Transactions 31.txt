Explanation=The Office of International Affairs (OIA) uses a number of legal resources to obtain information from foreign countries. Letters Rogatory are formal requests by the courts of one country to the courts of another country. The OIA also uses Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) between the United States and foreign countries that provide for the exchange of information and documents relating to narcotics, money laundering, and other financial crimes.See page(s) 3.851 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
