Explanation=The Office of International Affairs uses a number of legal resources to obtain information from foreign countries. Letters Rogatory are formal requests by the courts of one country to the courts of another country. The OIA also uses Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) between the United States and foreign countries that provide for the exchange of information and documents relating to narcotics, money laundering, and other financial crimes. Some of the countries that currently have treaties in force are Switzerland, Italy. Netherlands, Turkey, Caicos, Canada, Cayman Islands, Bahamas, Anguilla, Montserrat, British Virgin Islands, Argentina. United Kingdom, Jamaica. Republic of Korea. Nigeria, Panama, and Spain. More countries are added to the list each year.See page(s) 3.851-3.852 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
