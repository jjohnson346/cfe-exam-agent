Explanation=If an anomaly is found in the financial statements and transactions and further investigation is desired, it might be appropriate to pull a statistical sample. By using statistical sampling, the examiner can look at fewer transactions rather than the entire population. There are two basic risks associated with statistical sampling: sampling risk and nonsampling risk. Sampling risk is the probability that the sample is not representative of the population; nonsampling risk is the possibility of making the wrong decision. Nonsampling risk cannot be quantified. However, fraud examiners can control it through adequate planning and supervision of audit engagements.See page(s) 3.831 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
