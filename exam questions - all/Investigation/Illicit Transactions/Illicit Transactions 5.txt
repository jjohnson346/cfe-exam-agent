It will include all transactions conducted for the customer.•	Signature card: A signature card should be on file, which will show all those authorized to conduct transactions on the account.•	Securities receipts: These receipts are issued to a customer when he delivers securities to the broker for sale.•	Cash receipts: These receipts are issued to a customer when he delivers currency to the broker.•	Confirmation slips: These are issued to a customer to show the type of transaction (buy or sell) and the amount involved in the transaction.•	Securities delivered receipt: This receipt is signed by the customer when a securities purchase is delivered to the customer.See page(s) 3.824 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
