Stem=Searches of which of the following records are useful in developing background information on a subject?

Options=Bankruptcy filings, tax liens, and judgments | DMV driving records | Credit bureau headers | All of the above

CorrectResponse=3

Explanation=Some of the searches useful in developing background information are listed below:â€¢	Credit bureau header searches are among the most powerful locator tools. Nearly all people have been involved in some credit activity either under their true names or an assumed (â€œalso known asâ€?) name.â€¢	A current occupant/new address search may be used to identify the occupant of an address, to confirm occupancy, to uncover a forwarding address, or to develop a list of neighbors who may know the suspectâ€™s current whereabouts.â€¢	Last name searches can be used if the past address is unknown. This search produces better results if the name is not common; however, if the last name is common, differentiating information should be included in the search.â€¢	Searches of bankruptcy filings, tax liens, and court judgments have emerged in recent years as locator tools, because such records contain valid Social Security numbers.	z\See page(s) 3.518-3.520 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
