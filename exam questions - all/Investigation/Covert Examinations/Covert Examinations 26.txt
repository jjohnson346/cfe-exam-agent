Explanation=Recording conversations with eavesdropping devices (supersensitive microphones that listen from behind closed doors, for example) usually is illegal. People behind closed doors have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Videotaping or photographing someone in a public place is legal if the person does not have a “reasonable expectation" of privacy in such a place. For instance a restroom or locker room might be a “public place," but people have a reasonable expectation of privacy that they will not be photographed there. If operatives or witnesses are used to record telephone or other conversations, written consent should be obtained.See page(s) 3.304 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
