Stem=In preparing a memorandum reflecting information furnished by a confidential source, how should the source usually be identified on paper?

Options=Confidential source information should not be written down in a report | By name | Symbols | None of the above

CorrectResponse=2

Explanation=When reporting contacts, it is recommended that all contact with informants and sources be reported on a memorandum of interview, although the confidential sourceâ€™s or informantâ€™s identity should not be included in the report. Symbols to denote the informant's identity should be used. It is further recommended that sources be preceded with an â€œS' followed by a unique identifier (i.e., source #1 would be â€œS-1"; source #2 would be â€œS-2â€?). The symbols for informants would then be â€œ1-1" and â€œI-2.â€?See page(s) 3.317 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
