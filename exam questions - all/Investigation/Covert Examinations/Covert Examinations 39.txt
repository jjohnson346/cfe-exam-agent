Explanation=There are two general types of surveillance: mobile and fixed. Mobile surveillance sometimes is referred to as â€˜tailing" or â€œshadowing," and fixed surveillance as a â€œstakeoutâ€? or â€˜plant." Mobile surveillance can be done on foot or by vehicle and is carried out when people being observed move from location to location. Fixed surveillance is used when a person or activity remains in place, although the observers might move from one vantage point to another in the immediate area.See page(s) 3.305 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
