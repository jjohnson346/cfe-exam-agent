Explanation=When reporting contacts, it is recommended that all contact with informants and sources be reported on a memorandum of interview, although the confidential sourceâ€™s or informant's identity should not be included in the report. Symbols to denote the informantâ€™s identity should be used. It is further recommended that sources be preceded with an â€œS" followed by a unique identifier (i.e.. source #1 would be â€œS-1" source #2 would be â€œS-2â€?). The symbol for informants would then be â€œ1-11 and â€œ1-2."See page(s) 3.317 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
