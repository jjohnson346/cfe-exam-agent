Section=Written Reports

Stem=For a written statement to be legal and admissible into a court of law, the statement should be:

Options=In the handwriting of the suspect | Typewritten | In the handwriting of the interviewer | Any of the above

CorrectResponse=3

Explanation=There is no legal requirement that a statement must be in the handwriting or wording of the declarant. Because the examiner usually knows how to draft a valid statement, to let a confessor draft the statement is generally not a good idea. However, a statementâ€™s wording should be precise.See page(s) 3.921 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
