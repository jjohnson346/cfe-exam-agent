Explanation=When contacting a respondent for the first time, the interviewer must identify himself. This is best accomplished by stating your name. Unless a specific reason exists, the interviewer generally should omit a title. The less formality in general, the better. In some instances, stating a title cannot be avoided. In those cases, the title used should not conjure up emotion or possible fear in the mind of the respondent.See page(s) 3.214 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
