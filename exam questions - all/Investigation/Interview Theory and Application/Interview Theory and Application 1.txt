Explanation="Paralinguistic communication" involves the use of volume, pitch, and voice quality to convey meaning. One of the basic differences between written and verbal communication is that oral speech gives the full range of nonverbal accompaniment. For example, a â€?yes" answer might not mean complete agreement; it depends on the way in which the "yes" is said. The interviewer must learn to listen and observe changes in the nonverbal accompaniment and whether the verbal and nonverbal are harmoniously reinforcing or tend to give conflicting signals, as in cases where the respondent is trying to deceive the interviewer. Ten emotions have been studied by social scientists: anger, fear, happiness, jealousy, love, nervousness, pride, sadness, satisfaction, and sympathy. Some emotions, like anger and nervousness, can be more reliably identified than the others.See page(s) 3.219 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
