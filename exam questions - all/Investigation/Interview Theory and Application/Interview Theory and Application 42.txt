Section=Interview Theory and Application

Stem=In conducting interviews, the interviewer should establish a theme before serious questioning begins. The most successful theme is usually:

Options=That the interviewer needs help | That an official inquiry is being conducted | That the interviewer suspects the respondent is guilty | None of the above

CorrectResponse=0

Explanation=The interview theme may be related only indirectly to the actual purpose of the interview The goal of the theme is to get the respondent to assist in the interview. Generally, the most effective interview theme is that help is being sought. Nearly all people get satisfaction from helping others. In most interviews, the interviewer should approach the respondent so that person is made to feel important in helping out. During this phase of the interview, the respondent must not feel threatened in any way. An effective approach is the "Columbo-style," (although perhaps not in such a rumpled way) in which at least two thoughts go through the mind of Columbo's subjects: (1) he is no threat to me: and (2) he really needs my help.See page(s) 3.214-3.215 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
