Explanation="Catharsis" is the process by which a person obtains a release from unpleasant emotional tensions by talking about the source of these tensions. We often feel better by talking about something that upsets us. Although we all are familiar with the frequent necessity for catharsis in ourselves, we do not always perceive the same need in others. The need for sympathetic understanding and the need for catharsis are related, but they are not the same thing. The interviewer who does not have time to listen to what he considers inconsequential or egocentric talk will often find the respondent unwilling to share important consequences.See page(s) 3.211 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
