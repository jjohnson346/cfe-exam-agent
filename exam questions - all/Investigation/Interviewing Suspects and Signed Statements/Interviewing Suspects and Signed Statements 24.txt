Section=Interviewing Suspects and Signed Statements

Stem=Blue, a Certified Fraud Examiner, is attempting to get a fraud suspect to admit guilt. Blue should:

Options=Directly accuse the suspect | Give the suspect an excuse for his behavior | Show the suspect incriminating evidence | Any of these choices is correct

CorrectResponse=3

Explanation=When attempting to obtain an admission of guilt from a suspect, the examiner should offer the suspect a morally acceptable excuse for his behavior, v/hich will make it easier for the suspect to admit guilt without being embarrassed. This will often lead to a partial admission of guilt. When this occurs it usually is only a matter of time until the suspect provides a full confession. In most admission-seeking interviews, the examiner will also make a direct accusation of guilt at some point. The accusation should not be made in the form of a question, but as a statement. Emotive words such as â€œsteal," â€œfraud,â€? and â€œcrime" should be avoided during the accusatory process. The accusation should be phrased as though the accusedâ€™s guilt has already been established so that the accused is psychologically trapped with no way out. It is also permissible to show incriminating evidence to the suspect. It is important, however, that the suspect not be allowed the opportunity to destroy or alter documents.See page(s) 3.251, 3.254 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
