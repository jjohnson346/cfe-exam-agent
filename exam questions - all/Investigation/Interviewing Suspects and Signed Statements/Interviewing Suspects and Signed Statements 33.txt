Section=Interviewing Suspects and Signed Statements

Stem=Beta, a Certified Fraud Examiner, is conducting an admission-seeking interview of Gamma, a fraud suspect. After Beta gave Gamma an appropriate rationalization for his conduct, Gamma continued his denials, giving various alibis. These alibis usually can be defused by which of the following techniques?

Options=Displaying physical evidence | Discussing previous deceptions | Discussing witnesses, but not naming them | All of the above

CorrectResponse=3

Explanation=Even if the accused is presented with an appropriate rationalization, it is likely that he will continue to want to deny culpability. When the interviewer is successful in stopping denials, the accused normally will then turn to various reasons why he could not have committed the act in question. The purpose of this stage is to convince the accused of the weight of the evidence against him. Miscreants usually have a keen interest in material that tends to implicate them. Alibis generally can be diffused using one of three methods: displaying physical evidence, discussing other witnesses, and discussing previous deceptions.See page(s) 3.261 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
