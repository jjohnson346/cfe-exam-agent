Stem=Revenue is recognized on long-term construction contracts under one of two methods. Which of the following is one of those methods?

Options=Disbursement/recovery method | Partial-contract method | Percentage-of-completion method | Cost-to-market method

CorrectResponse=2

Explanation=Long-term contracts pose special problems for revenue recognition. Long-term construction contracts, for example, use either the completed-contract method or the percentage-of-completion method, depending partly on the circumstances The completed contract method does not record revenue until the project is 100 percent complete. Construction costs are held in an inventory account until completion of the project. The percentage-of-completion method recognizes revenues and expenses as measurable progress on a project is made, but this method is particularly vulnerable to manipulation. Managers can often easily manipulate the percentage of completion and the estimated costs to complete a construction project in order to recognize revenues prematurely and conceal contract overruns.See page(s) 1.314 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
