Explanation=EDI eliminates the abilities that fraud examiners have to detect fraud in the health care industry in three ways:‰?¢	The automation of claims has erased claims professionals7 ability to detect suspicious-looking claims. Because they are used to handling the paperwork of claims, EDI hampers the claims professional from getting a good picture of the overall nature of an account, instead reducing each transaction to individual claims.‰?¢	Because of the impersonal nature of electronic transactions, EDI raises the temptation of would-be fraudsters to commit white-collar crime.‰?¢	EDI leaves no paper trail, making the process of fraud detection difficult for the fraud examiner.See page(s) 1.1249 in the Fraud Examiner‰??s Manual
