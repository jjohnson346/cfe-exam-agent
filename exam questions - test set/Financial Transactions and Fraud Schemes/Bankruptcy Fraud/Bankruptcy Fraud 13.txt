If the debtor's books and records are missing, incomplete, or unreliable, they should be obtained from third parties, such as banks, customers, related parties, etc. If a third party resists the trustee s request, the trustee can subpoena records or testimony under Bankruptcy Rule 2004.See page(s) 1.1311 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
