CorrectResponse=2

Explanation=Companies should develop a program for safeguarding proprietary information (SPI). Businesses should seek out a corporate information officer (CIO) to develop and manage an SPI program. An alternative is to hire a security management consultant to develop a program and then maintain it on a yearly basis. In either case, the CIO should have information management skills and be knowledgeable about trade secret protection.See page(s) 1.878 in the Fraud Examiner's Manual
