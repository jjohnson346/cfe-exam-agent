Section=Fraudulent Disbursements

Stem=Which of the following methods is NOT suggested in Corporate Fraud Handbook as a way to detect a ghost employee scheme?

Options=Look for employees who have no withholding taxes, insurance or other normal payroll deductions | Review payroll records for duplicate social security numbers | Review payroll records for duplicate addresses or deposit accounts | Compare the disbursement date of trust account taxes with the deposit date

CorrectResponse=3

Explanation=If payroll checks are either mailed or deposited automatically, then a list of duplicate addresses or deposit accounts may reveal ghost employees or duplicate payments. Because each employee is required to have a Social Security number, a listing of duplicate numbers may reveal ghost employees. An analysis of the payroll withholdings may reveal either ghost employees or trust account abuses. Ghost employees often will have no withholding taxes, insurance, or other normal deductions. Therefore, a listing of employees without these items may reveal a ghost employee. Comparing the disbursement date of trust account taxes with the deposit date is not an effective method for detecting ghost employee schemes.See page(s) 237-238 in the Corporate Fraud Handbook
